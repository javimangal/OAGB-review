6,Prognostic Characteristics of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver in Patients with Obesity Who Undergo One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass Surgery: A Secondary Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trial Data.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is closely associated with obesity and insulin resistance (IR). Identifying characteristics that predict a higher risk of fibrosis using noninvasive methods is particularly important. We performed a secondary analysis of data from an RCT of 48 patients after one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) surgery, supplemented with specifically formulated probiotics and micronutrients or control treatment for 12 weeks. Patients were categorized using alanine aminotransferase (ALAT; >35 U/L for women, >50 U/L for men), higher NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) > -1.455), and IR (HOMA-IR > 2.0). This trial was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (ID: NCT03585413). Abnormal ALAT was associated with high triglycerides, blood pressure (BP), glucose, and fatty liver index (FLI). NFS > -1.455 was linked to higher age, body mass, waist circumference, and FLI, and lower albumin and platelet count. HOMA-IR > 2.0 was associated with higher BP and triglycerides, lower HDL-cholesterol, higher serum transaminases, and higher probabilities of steatosis and fibrosis. Twelve weeks postoperatively, patients with NFS > -1.455 showed greater reductions in body mass, systolic BP, serum insulin, and HbA1c, whereas those with NFS â‰¤ -1.455 showed improvements in FLI and lipid metabolism but had high glucose concentrations. Patients with HOMA-IR â‰¤ 2.0 also had high glucose concentrations. The evaluation of common biomarker scores for fibrosis and IR may help clinicians to recognize severe NAFLD and improve the outcomes of OAGB surgery.",10.3390/nu16183210,1,,1,1
10,EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF ONE ANASTOMOSIS GASTRIC BYPASS IN SURGICAL TREATMENT OF OBESITY: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS.,"One anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) has gained prominence in the search for better results in bariatric surgery. However, its efficacy and safety compared to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) remain ill-defined. To compare the efficacy and safety of OAGB relative to RYGB and SG in the treatment of obesity. We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Lilacs, and Google Scholar databases for randomized controlled trials comparing OAGB with RYGB or SG in the surgical approach to obesity. We pooled outcomes for body mass index, percentage of excess weight loss, type-2 diabetes mellitus remission, complications, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Statistical analyses were performed with R software (version 4.2.3). Data on 854 patients were extracted from 11 randomized controlled trials, of which 422 (49.4%) were submitted to OAGB with mean follow-up ranging from six months to five years. The meta-analysis revealed a significantly higher percentage of excess weight loss at 1-year follow-up and a significantly lower body mass index at 5-year follow-up in OAGB patients. Conversely, rates of type-2 diabetes mellitus remission, complications, and gastroesophageal reflux disease were not significantly different between groups. The overall quality of evidence was considered very low. Our results corroborate the comparable efficacy of OAGB in relation to RYGB and SG in the treatment of obesity, maintaining no significant differences in type-2 diabetes mellitus remission, complications, and gastroesophageal reflux disease rates.",10.1590/0102-6720202400021e1814,1,,1,2
31,Laparoscopic Roux-Y-gastric bypass versus laparoscopic one-anastomosis gastric bypass for obesity: clinical & metabolic results of a prospective randomized controlled trial.,"One anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) has been proposed as an effective alternative to the current standard procedure in Switzerland, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Prospective data comparing both procedures are scarce. Therefore, we performed a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial assessing the effectiveness and safety of these 2 operative techniques. Eighty patients were randomized 1:1. OAGB consisted of a very long gastric pouch with a 200Â cm biliopancreatic limb, RYGB of a 150Â cm ante-colic alimentary and a 60Â cm biliopancreatic limb, respectively. Primary endpoint was the percent excess weight loss (%EWL) at 12Â months after surgery. Mean %EWL at 12Â months was 87.9% (SD24.4) in the RYGB group and 104.1% (SD24.6) in the OAGB group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.006). There was no mortality. The rate of marginal ulcers was higher in patients with OAGB compared to those with RYGB (pâ€‰=â€‰0.011), while the total number of late complications did not statistically differ between the two groups. Except for the remission of GERD, which was higher in the RYGB group compared to OAGB, there was no difference between the groups regarding the remission of comorbidities. OAGB showed improved glucose control compared to the RYGB after 1 year (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001). Furthermore, glucagon-like peptide-1 increase was significantly higher in OAGB at 6 weeks (pâ€‰=â€‰0.041) and 1 year after surgery (pâ€‰=â€‰0.029). Quality of life improved after both surgeries, without differences between the groups. %EWL 1 year after surgery was higher in OAGB than in RYGB. A better glycemic control with a higher increase in GLP-1 was observed after OAGB compared to RYGB. This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under the identifier NCT02601092.",10.1007/s00464-024-10907-7,1,,1,3
40,Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy vs one-anastomosis gastric bypass 5-year follow-up: a single-blinded randomized controlled trial.,"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is the most performed bariatric procedure worldwide, whereas one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is the third most performed procedure. Both procedures have reported good weight loss (WL) and low complications. However, should both have differences in the durability of WL and malnutrition? A single-blinded, randomized controlled trial of 300 patients was conducted to compare the outcomes of LSG and OAGB over a 5-year follow-up. The primary endpoint was WL in percentages of total WL (%TWL) and excess WL (%EWL). The secondary endpoints were complications, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), associated medical problems, bariatric analysis and reporting outcome system (BAROS) assessment, and weight recurrence (WR). Overall, 201 patients (96 in the LSG group and 105 in the OAGB group) completed 5 years of follow-up. OAGB had significantly higher %TWL and %EWL than those of LSG throughout the follow-up. LSG had significantly higher WR and GERD. Both procedures had significant improvement in associated medical problems and BAROS scores compared with baseline, with no significant difference. WR was associated with higher relapse of associated medical conditions after initial remission and with lower BAROS scores regarding WL scores. OAGB had significantly higher WL, less WR, and less GERD. However, it had a higher incidence of bile reflux. Both procedures had comparable complication rates, excellent remissions in associated medical problems, and improved quality of life. WR was associated with significantly more relapse of associated medical problems and significantly lower BAROS scores.",10.1016/j.gassur.2024.01.038,1,,1,4
52,A Three-Arm Randomized Controlled Trial of Primary One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass: With FundoRing or Nissen Fundoplications vs. without Fundoplication for the Treatment of Obesity and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease.,"Background and Objectives: Obesity and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are steadily increasing world weight and antireflux surgery must be performed simultaneously with bariatric surgery in obese patients. The purpose of this study is to compare bariatric and antireflux results after OAGB with different methods of fundoplication using the excluded stomach and without fundoplication. Materials and methods: This open-label, randomized, parallel three-arm trial was conducted from March 2019 and December 2021. All patients underwent laparoscopic one-anastomosis gastric bypass and suture cruroplasty, and then had a follow-up at 24 months. Group 1 of patients had fundoplication FundoRing using the excluded stomach (FundoRingOAGB); Group 2, with Nissen fundoplication using the excluded stomach (NissenOAGB); and Group 3, without fundoplication (OAGB). We studied changes in BMI, GERD symptoms (GERD-HRQL), and the VISICK score. Results: Of 219 participants screened, 150 were randomly allocated to 3 groups: FundoRingOAGB group (n = 50), NissenOAGB group (n = 50), and OAGB group (n = 50). At post-treatment month 24, BMI changes were as follows: from 40.7 Â± 5.9 (31-53) to 24.3 Â± 2.8 (19-29) kg/m2 in FundoRingOAGB group; from 39.9 Â± 5.3 (32-54) to 26.3 Â± 2.9 (23-32) kg/m2 in Nissen group; and from 40.9 Â± 6.2 (32-56) to 28.5 Â± 3.9 (25-34) kg/m2 in OAGB group. The mean pre-operative GERD-HRQL heartburn score improved post-op in FundoRingOAGB group from 20.6 Â± 2.24 (19.96, 21.23) to 0.44 Â± 0.73 (0.23, 0,64); in NissenOAGB group from 21.34 Â± 2.43 (20.64, 22.03) to 1.14 Â± 1.4 (0.74, 1.53); and in OAGB group 20.5 Â± 2.17 (19.9, 21.25) to 2.12 Â± 1.36 (1.73, 2.5). GERD-HRQL total scores were from pre-op 25.2 Â± 2.7 (24.4, 25.9) to 4.34 Â± 1.3 (3.96, 4.7) post-op in FundoRingOAGB group; 24.8 Â± 2.93 (24, 25.67) pre-op to 5.42 Â± 1.7 (4.9, 5.9) in the NissenOAGB group; and from 21.46 Â± 2.7 (20.7, 22.2) to 7.44 Â± 2.7 (6.6, 8.2) in the OAGB group. The mean VISICK score improved from 3.64 Â± 0.94 (3.7, 3.9) to 1.48 Â± 1.26 (1.12, 1.84) in FundoRingOAGB, from 3.42 Â± 0.97 (3.1, 3,7) to 2.5 Â± 1.46 (2.06, 2.9) in NissenOAGB group and from 3.38 Â± 0.88 (3.1, 3,69) to 2.96 Â± 1.19 (2.62, 3.2) in OAGB group. Conclusions: Antireflux and bariatric results of FundoRingOAGB are better than using the NissenOAGB method and significantly better than OAGB without the use of fundoplication.",10.3390/medicina60030405,1,,1,5
54,Effect of anti-reflux suture on gastroesophageal reflux symptoms after one anastomosis gastric bypass: a randomized controlled trial.,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is an issue after one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) and modification of OAGB with adding an anti-reflux system may decrease the incidence of postoperative GERD. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of the anti-reflux mechanism to treat preoperative GERD and prevent de novo GERD. A prospective randomized clinical trial study was conducted on patients with a body mass index of 40 and more from August 2020 to February 2022. Patients undergoing one anastomosis gastric bypass with and without anti-reflux sutures (groups A and B, respectively). These patients had follow-ups for one year after the surgery. GERD symptoms were assessed in all the patients using the GERD symptom questionnaire. The mean age was 39.5â€‰Â±â€‰9.8 years and 40.7â€‰Â±â€‰10.2 years in groups A and B respectively. GERD symptoms remission occurred in 76.5% and 68.4% of patients in groups A and B, respectively. The incidence of de novo GERD symptoms was lower in group A, compared to group B (6.2% and 16.1% in groups A and B respectively), without any statistically significant difference (p-value: 0.239). GERD symptoms and de novo GERD after OAGB seems to be under-reported after OAGB. This study suggests that applying an anti-reflux suture can decrease de novo GERD symptoms.",10.1007/s00464-024-10792-0,1,,1,6
59,LSG vs OAGB: 7-Year Follow-up Data of a Randomised Control Trial and Comparative Outcome Based on BAROS Score.,"This study aims to evaluate and compare long-term results of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) based on bariatric analysis reporting and outcome system (BAROS) score. Patients operated for morbid obesity between 2013 and 2015 were randomised to LSG and OAGB groups. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 201 patients (100 LSG and 101 OAGB) were analysed for changes in total body weight (TBW), body mass index (BMI), percent excess weight loss (%EWL), percent total weight loss (%TWL), QoL (quality of life) scores, comorbidity resolution and outcome based on BAROS at 7Â years. Sixty-six LSG and 64 OAGB patients were followed up at 7Â years. Mean pre-operative TBW and BMI were 119â€‰Â±â€‰28.2 and 44.87â€‰Â±â€‰7.71 for LSG group and 113.25â€‰Â±â€‰23.74 and 44.71â€‰Â±â€‰8.75 for OAGB group respectively. At 7Â years after surgery, there was significant drop in mean TBW and BMI in both groups. Mean %EWL for LSG and OAGB patients was 50.78â€‰Â±â€‰28.48 and 59.99â€‰Â±â€‰23.32 and mean %TWL for LSG and OAGB patients was 23.22â€‰Â±â€‰12.66 and 27.71â€‰Â±â€‰12.27 respectively. Mean QoL scores at 7Â years were significantly higher than the pre-operative scores and most of the patients in both groups had remission or improvement in their comorbidities. 68.76% OAGB patients had very good or excellent outcome on BAROS score while only 36.37% LSG patients had similar outcome. LSG and OAGB are successful bariatric procedures over the long term. OAGB outperforms LSG and has significantly higher %EWL and %TWL over the long term.",10.1007/s11695-024-07114-7,1,,1,7
57,"Efficacy and safety of one anastomosis gastric bypass versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass at 5 years (YOMEGA): a prospective, open-label, non-inferiority, randomised extension study.","The multicentre randomised trial YOMEGA (NCT02139813) comparing the one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) with the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) confirmed the non-inferiority of OAGB on weight loss outcomes at 24 months. We aimed to report weight loss, metabolic, and safety outcomes at 5 years. YOMEGA is a prospective, open-label, non-inferiority, randomised trial conducted at nine centres in France. Inclusion criteria were BMI of 40 kg/m2 or more, or 35 kg/m2 or more with comorbidities. Key exclusion criteria were severe gastro-oesophageal reflux disease or Barrett's oesophagus and previous bariatric surgery. Patients were randomly assigned (1 :1) to OAGB (one gastrojejunal anastomosis with a 200 cm biliopancreatic limb) or RYGB (with a 150 cm alimentary limb and a 50 cm biliary limb), stratified by centre, with blocks of variable size. The primary endpoint of this extension study was percentage excess BMI loss and was analysed in the per-protocol population, including patients with data who were operated on with the technique randomly assigned to them and excluding patients with major deviations from the protocol during the follow-up (change of surgical technique, death, or withdrawal of consent). Non-inferiority was concluded for the primary endpoint if the upper bound of the CI was less than the non-inferiority limit (7 percentage points). YOMEGA is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02139813, and the 5-year follow-up of YOMEGA is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05549271. Between May 13, 2014, and March 2, 2016, 253 patients were randomly assigned to OAGB (n=129) or RYGB (n=124), and from these patients 114 in the OAGB group and 118 in the RYGB group were included in the per-protocol analysis. In the per-protocol population, at baseline, mean age was 43Â·0 years (SD 10Â·8), mean BMI was 44Â·0 kg/m2 (5Â·6), 54 (23%) patients were male and 178 (77%) were female; 55 (27%) of 207 patients had type 2 diabetes. After 5 years, mean percentage excess BMI loss was -75Â·6% (SD 28Â·1) in the OAGB group versus -71Â·4% (SD 29Â·8) in the RYGB group, confirming non-inferiority (mean difference -4Â·1% [90% CI -12Â·0 to 3Â·7], p=0Â·0099). Remission of type 2 diabetes was similar in both groups. Nutritional status did not differ; the most common adverse event was clinical gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, occurring in 27 (41%) of 66 patients in the OAGB group versus 14 (18%) of 76 patients in the RYGB group (p=0Â·0030). Among serious adverse events, ten (8%) of 127 patients converted from OAGB to RYGB. 171 (68%) of 253 patients were followed up. OAGB was not inferior to RYGB regarding percentage excess BMI loss at 5 years with similar metabolic outcomes. The high rate of clinical gastro-oesophageal reflux disease after OAGB raises questions about its long-term consequences, which need to be further investigated.

676,"Efficacy and safety of one anastomosis gastric bypass versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for obesity (YOMEGA): a multicentre, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial.","One anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is increasingly used in the treatment of morbid obesity. However, the efficacy and safety outcomes of this procedure remain debated. We report the results of a randomised trial (YOMEGA) comparing the outcomes of OAGB versus standard Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). This prospective, multicentre, randomised non-inferiority trial, was held in nine obesity centres in France. Patients were eligible for inclusion if their body-mass index (BMI) was 40 kg/m2 or higher, or 35 kg/m2 or higher with the presence of at least one comorbidity (type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, obstructive sleep apnoea, dyslipidaemia, or arthritis), and were aged 18-65 years. Key exclusion criteria were a history of oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus, severe gastro-oesophageal reflux disease resistant to proton-pump inhibitors, and previous bariatric surgery. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to OAGB or RYGB, stratified by centre with blocks of variable size; the study was open-label, with no masking required. RYGB consisted of a 150 cm alimentary limb and a 50 cm biliary limb and OAGB of a single gastrojejunal anastomosis with a 200 cm biliopancreatic limb. The primary endpoint was percentage excess BMI loss at 2 years. The primary endpoint was assessed in the per-protocol population and safety was assessed in all randomised participants. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02139813, and is now completed. From May 13, 2014, to March 2, 2016, of 261 patients screened for eligibility, 253 (97%) were randomly assigned to OAGB (n=129) or RYGB (n=124). Five patients did not undergo their assigned surgery, and after undergoing their surgery 14 were excluded from the per-protocol analysis (seven due to pregnancy, two deaths, one withdrawal, and four revisions from OAGB to RYGB) In the per-protocol population (n=117 OAGB, n=117 RYGB), mean age was 43Â·5 years (SD 10Â·8), mean BMI was 43Â·9 kg/m2 (SD 5Â·6), 176 (75%) of 234 participants were female, and 58 (27%) of 211 with available data had type 2 diabetes. After 2 years, mean percentage excess BMI loss was -87Â·9% (SD 23Â·6) in the OAGB group and -85Â·8% (SD 23Â·1) in the RYGB group, confirming non-inferiority of OAGB (mean difference -3Â·3%, 95% CI -9Â·1 to 2Â·6). 66 serious adverse events associated with surgery were reported (24 in the RYGB group vs 42 in the OAGB group; p=0Â·042), of which nine (21Â·4%) in the OAGB group were nutritional complications versus none in the RYGB group (p=0Â·0034). OAGB is not inferior to RYGB regarding weight loss and metabolic improvement at 2 years. Higher incidences of diarrhoea, steatorrhoea, and nutritional adverse events were observed with a 200 cm biliopancreatic limb OAGB, suggesting a malabsorptive effect.

240,The United States Experience with One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass at MBSAQIP-Accredited Centers.,"One anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) has emerged as a potentially safe and effective weight-loss procedure. Worldwide, OAGB is the third most commonly performed primary bariatric procedure, comprising 4% of the annual volume. In the USA, OAGB has yet to be endorsed as a primary bariatric procedure and can only be performed under research protocols or as a revision procedure. We performed an observational cohort study to describe the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative characteristics of adult patients who underwent primary or revision OAGB from 2015 to 2019 at MBSAQIP centers. Exclusion criteria included emergent surgery, incomplete 30-day follow-up, and non-laparoscopic- or robotic approach. During the study period, 803,906 bariatric procedures were performed and 645 (0.08%) were OAGB. Among these, 436 (67.6%) were primary and 209 (32.4%) were revision OAGB. The mean operation time was 89Â min (SD, 59) and 8% were performed using a robotic approach. The overall complication rate was 7.4% and there was one death (0.2%). The post-operative complication rates were generally higher than the early complication rate (3.4%) reported in the YOMEGA trial, an RCT from France. Revision OAGB had a longer mean operation time of 141Â min (SD, 85, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Primary OAGB was a rarely performed bariatric procedure at MBSAQIP-accredited centers comprising only 0.05% compared to 4% worldwide. Future studies should compare safety of OAGB to that of established bariatric procedures like Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy.",10.1007/s11695-022-06002-2,1,,1,10
487,One anastomosis gastric bypass vs. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a 5-year follow-up prospective randomized trial.,"One anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is a relatively novel technique with excellent outcomes, comparable to most accepted procedures. Our aim was to compare OAGB and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in terms of percent of excess weight lost (%EWL) and resolution of comorbidities. Thirty-three patients were randomly assigned (1:2) to two groups (OAGB = 9 and RYGB = 24). Patients were analyzed prospectively. The 5-year follow-up was 85% (28 patients). Both groups were comparable preoperatively in age, weight, body mass index (BMI), and excess weight. One intraoperative complication in OAGB group and no major postoperative complications for both groups were recorded. Progressive decrease in weight, BMI, and %EWL was observed at 1, 6, 12 months, and 5 years, with no differences between groups. Regarding comorbidities, we registered complete remission in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia with OAGB. RYGB group reported complete remission in T2DM, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Mean operative time were 113.3 min Â± 41.2 and 143.7 min Â± 21.85 for OAGB and RYGB respectively. Mean number of reloads used was 5 for OAGB and 7 for RYGB, which demands further investigations. Postoperative pain was significantly higher in RYGB group. Hospital stay was 3 days for both groups. At 5-year follow-up, patients of both techniques achieved similar outcomes in terms of %EWL and resolution of comorbidities, without early or mid-term major complications and no mortality. OAGB demonstrated less use of surgical stapling and unexplainably less postoperative pain compared to RYGB.",10.1007/s00423-020-01949-1,0,,1,11
159,A Randomized Controlled Trial of Acid and Bile Reflux Esophagitis Prevention by Modified Fundoplication of the Excluded Stomach in One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass: 1-Year Results of the FundoRing Trial.,"The advantages and disadvantages of one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) with primary modified fundoplication using the excluded stomach (""FundoRing"") is unclear. We aimed to assess the impact of this operation in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and answer the next questions: (1) What the impact of wrapping the fundus of the excluded part of the stomach in OAGB on protection in the experimental group against developing de novo reflux esophagitis? (2) If preoperative RE could be improved in the experimental group? (3) Can preoperative acid reflux as measured by PH impedance, be treated by the addition of the ""FundoRing""? The study design was a single-center prospective, interventional, open-label (no masking) RCT (FundoRing Trial) with 1-year follow-up. Endpoints were body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) and acid and bile RE assessed endoscopically by Los Angeles (LA) classification and 24-h pH impedance monitoring. Complications were graded by Clavien-Dindo classification (CDC). One hundred patients (nâ€‰=â€‰50 FundoRingOAGB (f-OAGB) vs nâ€‰=â€‰50 standard OAGB (s-OAGB)) with complete follow-up data were included in the study. During OAGB procedures, patients with hiatal hernia underwent cruroplasty (29/50 f-OAGB; 24/50Â s-OAGB). There were no leaks, bleeding, or deaths in either group. At 1Â year, BMI in the f-OAGB group was 25.3â€‰Â±â€‰2.77 (19-30) vs 26.48â€‰Â±â€‰2.8 (21-34) s-OAGB group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.03). In f-OAGB vs s-OAGB groups, respectively, acid RE was seen in 1 vs 12 patients (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001) and bile RE in 0 vs 4 patients (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Routine use of a modified fundoplication of the OAGB-excluded stomach to treat patients with obesity decreased acid and prevented bile reflux esophagitis significantly more effectively than standard OAGB at 1Â year in a randomized controlled trial.

236,Revisional Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Versus Revisional One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass After Failed Sleeve Gastrectomy: a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"High rates of revision surgery have been reported for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), with weight regain (WR) as the most frequently reported cause. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the most commonly performed revision procedure, whereas one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is a less popular approach. A single-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted. One hundred seventy-six patients were enrolled and randomized. After loss to follow-up, 80 patients for RYGB and 80 patients for OAGB were analyzed, with a 2-year follow-up. Patients with grade B or higher gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) were excluded. Early and late postoperative complications were recorded. Body mass index (BMI), percentage of excess BMI loss (%EBMIL), nutritional laboratory test results, and the resolution of associated medical problems were assessed after revision surgery. After 2Â years, both groups achieved significantly lower BMI than their post-LSG nadir BMI (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The %EBMIL changes showed significantly faster weight loss in the OAGB group than in the RYGB at the 6-month follow-up (mean difference: 8.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.2 to 16.9%). However, at 1-year and 2-year follow-ups, the differences were statistically insignificant (pâ€‰>â€‰0.05). Early and late complications were similar between two groups. Both groups showed improvement or resolution of associated medical problems, with no statistically significant differences after 2Â years (pâ€‰=â€‰1.00). Both revisional RYGB and OAGB have comparable significant weight loss effects when performed for WR after LSG. After a 2-year follow-up, both procedures were safe, with no significant differences in the occurrence of complications and nutritional deficits.",10.1007/s11695-022-06266-8,0,,1,13
60,One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass versus Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: A Randomized Prospective Trial.,"Background and Objectives: One anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgeries are effective methods used in bariatric surgery. There are limited randomized studies comparing these procedures over more than 2 years. Here, we aimed to compare the 3-year results of two bariatric procedures. Materials and Methods: Patients included in this randomized prospective study were compared in OAGB and RYGB groups. A total of 55 patients, aged between 18 and 65, were eligible for the study. Thirteen patients who did not accept randomization were excluded. Patients were evaluated at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months postoperatively. Results: Three patients were excluded from the study due to loss of communication during the clinical follow-up and one due to death by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which started in the eighth month after surgery. The study was completed with a total of 38 patients (OAGB; n = 20, RYGB; n = 18). Patients in the two groups were similar in terms of age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and obesity-related comorbidities. At the end of 3-year follow-up, BMI in the OAGB and RYGB groups was 28.80 Â± 4.53 kg/m2 and 29.17 Â± 5.36 kg/m2, respectively (p = 0.822). Percentage total weight loss (TWL%) was similar. No significant differences were found between the groups regarding percentage excess weight loss (EWL%). Remission of comorbidities was similar. De novo refluxes developed in four OAGB patients; there were no occurrences of these in RYGB patients (p = 0.066). Conclusions: Both OAGB and RYGB are effective in the treatment of morbid obesity. The two procedures are similarly successful in terms of obesity-related comorbidities.",10.3390/medicina60020256,0,,1,14
76,"A systematic review and meta-analysis on GERD after OAGB: rate, treatments, and success.","This review aims to investigate the gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as one of the important concerns for both surgeons and patients after one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane were reviewed by the end of the 2021 with keywords relating to GERD, OAGB, and their equivalents. Data regarding OAGB, number of patients with GERD, treatment for GERD, endoscopy findings, the interval between GERD and OAGB were retrieved by two independent investigators. The primary effect/effect size measure was prevalence. 40 studies examining 17,299 patients were included revealing that 2% of patients experience GERD following OAGB. Reflux after revisional OAGB is six times higher than primary OAGB. Despite being unclear, medical and surgical treatments for GERD after OAGB were used in 60% and 41% of patients with estimated success rate of 85% and 100%, respectively. Based on how GERD was identified after OAGB, its rate ranged from 0 to 55%; the pooled rate of 2% is near to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. GERD symptoms can be mild to be tolerated without medical treatment, moderate that respond to acid-reducing agents, or severe enough that are categorized as interactable and would need a surgical intervention.",10.1080/17474124.2023.2296992,0,,1,15
201,Efficacy and Safety of One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass Versus Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass for Obesity: a Meta-analysis and Systematic Review.,"The objective of this review is to systematically review the efficacy and safety outcomes of one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). From inception to July 4, 2022, a systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for randomized clinical trials comparing OAGB with RYGB in obesity. A meta-analysis performed using the RevMan 5.4.1 software evaluations was completed. We identified 1217 reports; after exclusions, eight trials with a total of 931 patients were eligible for analysis. Compared with RYGB, OAGB had multiple advantageous indexes. Examples include percent of excess weight loss (%EWL) at 12Â months (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.009), body mass index (BMI) at 2Â years (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.00001), early postoperative complication (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.04), remission of dyslipidemia (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001), and operative time (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.00001). No significant statistical difference was observed in BMI at 6Â months, %EWL at 6Â months, BMI at 12Â months, percent of excess body mass index loss (%EBMIL) at 2Â years, BMI at 5Â years, intraoperative complications, late postoperative complications, remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia or gastroesophageal reflux disease remission between OAGB and RYGB. OAGB is no less effective than RYGB; no significant differences in weight loss efficacy were observed, and more large and long-term randomized controlled trials are needed to verify this. In addition, studies have shown that OAGB has a shorter operation time, fewer early postoperative complications, and a shorter learning curve, making it easier for young surgeons to perform.",10.1007/s11695-022-06401-5,0,,1,16
362,Laparoscopic One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass Versus Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Effects on Pre-existing Mild-to-Moderate Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease in Patients with Obesity: a Randomized Controlled Study.,"Patients with obesity having GERD usually undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) as the procedure of choice. However, the emergence of one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) as a less time-consuming operation with fewer complications offers a potential option for these patients. This randomized controlled trial included 80 patients (out of 457 screened) with mild-to-moderate GERD that were equally divided into two groups for OAGB and RYGB. GERD was diagnosed by 20-item questionnaire, upper endoscopy, 24-h pH monitoring, and manometry. Follow-up at 6 and 12Â months was done. No significant differences were found between the two groups regarding demographic data, comorbidities, and weight loss. OAGB had less operative time and fewer complications. Both procedures had comparable favorable effects in reducing the GERD symptoms evidenced by upper endoscopy, 24-h pH monitoring, and manometry. OAGB is a promising bariatric procedure in weight loss for patients with obesity having mild-to-moderate GERD (up to grade B esophagitis by Los Angeles score). Furthermore, wide-scale studies and on more severe degrees of GERD are required to fully understand its benefits in GERD patients with obesity.",10.1007/s11695-021-05667-5,0,,1,17
94,Short-term outcomes of double omentopexy in one anastomosis gastric bypass surgery: A controlled clinical trial.,"This study aims to assess the efficacy of implementing a novel technique of reinforcement of gastric pouch and remnant stomach staple line with Double Omentopexy (DO) in patients undergoing One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB) surgery and evaluate its impact in reducing the early postoperative complications. The 123 patients were allocated into two groups: 61 in the standard OAGB group and 62 in OAGB with DO group. The primary outcomes are postoperative complications (including early postoperative bleeding, leakage, gastric twist, reflux, etc.) and hospital stay. The secondary outcome is excess body weight loss. Follow-up visits were planned after discharge: at two weeks, two months, and three months postoperatively. Postoperative complications were significantly lower, 3 (4.84%) in OAGB with DO compared with 10 (16.39%) in standard OAGB (P =0.037). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of early postoperative bleeding, deep vein thrombosis, biliary reflux, and gall bladder stone (P >.05). No patient had leakage in either group. The mean operative time was significantly longer (68.66 Â± 6.68 min) in OAGB with the DO group when compared with the standard OAGB group (62.16 Â± 7.54 min) (P <.001). Applying the DO technique may be a good measure to be added during OAGB to decrease the incidence of potential postoperative complications, especially the rate and severity of bleeding.",10.4103/njcp.njcp_26_23,0,,1,18
100,Does One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass Expose Patients to GastroesophagealÂ Reflux: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the incidence of new-onset gastroesophagealÂ reflux, reflux change, esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, and revision due to reflux, gastritis, and marginal ulcer after one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). We performed subgroup analyses based on primary and revisional OAGB and time of follow-up. Meta-analysis of 87 studies with 27,775 patients showed a 6% rate of new-onset reflux after OAGB. Preoperative reflux status did not change significantly after OAGB. The rate of esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus was 15% and 1%, respectively. The new-onset reflux rate after OAGB was significantly higher than gastric bypass but not different with sleeve gastrectomy. The current study showed a relatively low rate of reflux and its complications after OAGB, but it was significantly higher than Roux-en-YÂ gastric bypass.",10.1007/s11695-023-06866-y,0,,1,19
445,Evaluation of reflux following sleeve gastrectomy and one anastomosis gastric bypass: 1-year results from a randomized open-label controlled trial.,"Recent reports have demonstrated that de novo reflux and worsening of pre-existing symptoms occur after SG; concerns are still expressed about the risk of symptomatic biliary reflux gastritis and oesophagitis. The aim of our study was to investigate and compare the rate of postoperative acid and non-acid reflux following Mini-/One anastomosis gastric bypass (MGB/OAGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). A prospective randomized open-label, controlled trial registered on clinicaltrial.gov (NCT number: NCT02987673) has been carried out to evaluate esophagogastric junction exposure to reflux in the first year after MGB/OAGB and LSG using high impedance manometry, endoscopy, and a validated questionnaire. A total of 58 individuals were eventually enrolled in this trial and represented the per-protocol population (nâ€‰=â€‰28 MGB/OAGB, nâ€‰=â€‰30 LSG). No difference was found between the two groups in terms of demographic characteristics, PAGI-SYM score, acid exposure time percent of the esophagus (AET%), esophagitis, and other HRiM and MII-pH data at baseline. Comparing MII-pH outcomes of the two groups, AET% resulted significantly higher after LSG at 12Â months. Endoscopic findings showed a significant increase of esophagitisâ€‰â‰¥â€‰B in the LSG group after 1Â year; postoperative esophagitisâ€‰â‰¥â€‰B resulted also significantly worsened after LSG when compared to MGB/OAGB. Since AET% and rate of esophagitis are significantly higher after LSG when compared to MGB/OAGB, this procedure should be preferred in case of preoperative subclinical reflux or low grade (A) esophagitis.",10.1007/s00464-020-08182-3,0,,1,20
458,One Anastomosis/Mini-Gastric Bypass (OAGB/MGB) as Revisional Surgery Following Primary Restrictive Bariatric Procedures: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"One anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB/MGB) has gained popularity in the past decade. International databases were searched for articles published by September 10, 2020, on OAGB/MGB as a revisional procedure after restrictive procedures. Twenty-six studies examining a total of 1771 patients were included. The mean initial BMI was 45.70Â kg/m2, which decreased to 31.52, 31.40, and 30.54Â kg/m2 at 1, 3, and 5-year follow-ups, respectively. Remission of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) following OAGB/MGB at 1-, 3-, and 5-year follow-up was 65.16â€‰Â±â€‰24.43, 65.37â€‰Â±â€‰36.07, and 78.10â€‰Â±â€‰14.19%, respectively. Remission/improvement rate from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Also, 7.4% of the patients developed de novo GERD following OAGB/MGB. Leakage was the most common major complication. OAGB/MGB appears to be feasible and effective as a revisional procedure after failed restrictive bariatric procedures.",10.1007/s11695-020-05079-x,0,,1,21
427,Applying an Anti-reflux Suture in the One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass to Prevent Biliary Reflux: a Long-Term Observational Study.,"The one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is an effective treatment to induce sustained weight loss in morbidly obese patients. Concerns remain regarding the development of reflux. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an ""anti-reflux suture"" as anti-reflux modification to prevent reflux. This is a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent a primary OAGB at the Center Obesity North-Netherlands (CON) between January 2015 and December 2016. Reflux was defined as symptoms of acid/bilious regurgitation or pyrosis. This was consequently asked and reported at each follow-up visit. Outcomes of patients with an anti-reflux suture were compared to those without. In 414 (59%) of the 703 included patients, an anti-reflux suture was applied. Follow-up at 3Â years was 74%. The incidence of reflux did not differ between patients with or without an anti-reflux suture (57 versus 56%, respectively; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.9). The presence of an anti-reflux suture was significantly associated with a lower incidence of conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) for reflux (OR 0.56, 95%CI 0.34-0.91). Patients preoperatively diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) were 5.2 times more likely to need a conversion to RYGB for reflux (95%CI 2.7-10.1). The presence of preoperative GERD should be weighted heavily in the decision to perform an OAGB as this is a major risk factor for conversion surgery due to reflux. The anti-reflux suture might be a valuable addition to the procedure of the OAGB because it results in fewer conversion surgeries for reflux.",10.1007/s11695-021-05238-8,0,,1,22
69,Outcomes of One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass Conversion to Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass for Severe Obesity: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"One-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is an effective procedure to treat severe obesity. However, conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is increasing. We therefore conducted a systematic review to determine the safety and efficacy associated with OAGB-RYGB conversion. A systematic search was conducted by three independent reviewers using Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library following PRISMA guidelines. Six studies including 134 patients were selected who were undergoing OAGB-RYGB conversion. The most common indications were reflux (47.8%), malnutrition (31.3%), and inadequate weight loss (8.2%). Study outcomes demonstrated 100% resolution of bile reflux. Overall, there was medium-term weight gain of 0.61 BMI. OAGB to RYGB conversion leads to resolution of reflux symptoms. However, it is associated with weight regain, albeit this may be acceptable to patients to treat biliary reflux.",10.1007/s11695-023-07050-y,0,,1,23
572,Clinical Outcomes of One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass Versus Sleeve Gastrectomy for Morbid Obesity.,"One anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are popular bariatric surgeries for morbid obesity. Reports on the safety and effectiveness of SG and OAGB are inconsistent. This meta-analysis investigated the clinical outcomes of SG versus those of OAGB for morbid obesity. Based on PRISMA guidelines, we searched the published articles in English from Scopus, PubMed (Medline), Central (Cochrane), and Embase databases. Articles were retrieved from the start date of each database to February 13, 2019. Statistical analysis of this meta-analysis was conducted in Stata 14.0, and the most appropriate effect model was chosen based on heterogeneity. A total of 20 articles examining 4064 OAGB patients and 3733 SG patients were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with SG, OAGB showed a higher percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) at 6Â months (weighted mean difference (WMD)â€‰=â€‰11.32; 95% CI 6.00-16.64), 12Â months (WMDâ€‰=â€‰8.22; 95% CI 3.78-12.66), 24Â months (WMDâ€‰=â€‰10.19; 95% CI 0.88-21.25), 36Â months (WMDâ€‰=â€‰7.93; 95% CI 3.37-12.48), 48Â months (WMDâ€‰=â€‰17.22; 95% CI 7.37-27.06), and 60Â months (WMDâ€‰=â€‰16.43; 95% CI 8.96-23.90). In addition, OAGB was associated with a lower rate of postoperative leak, gastroesophageal reflux disease, revisions, mortality, and dyslipidemia remission rates. However, OAGB increased the incidence of ulcers, malnutrition, and bile reflux. OAGB is more effective for %EWL and dyslipidemia remission than SG. In addition, OAGB may lower the risk of postoperative leak, gastroesophageal reflux disease, revision, and mortality. Further comparisons of the clinical outcomes of OAGB versus SG for morbid obesity would benefit from more high-quality controlled studies.",10.1007/s11695-019-04303-7,0,,1,24
89,One-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) as revisional procedures after failed laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG): systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative studies.,"The aim of this study was to compare weight loss and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) remission after one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) as revisional procedures after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). In PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, a search was performed using the terms ""Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus one anastomosis gastric bypass,"" ""revisional surgery,"" and ""sleeve gastrectomy."" Only original articles in English language comparing OAGB and RYGB were included. No temporal interval was set. The primary outcome measure was weight loss (%TWL). The secondary endpoints were leak, bleeding, marginal ulcer, and GERD. PRISMA flowchart was used. Differences in continuous and dichotomous outcome variables were expressed as mean difference (MD) and risk difference (RD) with 95% CI, respectively. Heterogeneity was assessed by using I2 statistic. Six retrospective comparative articles were included in the present meta-analysis. Weight loss analysis showed a MD = 5.70 (95% CI 4.84-6.57) in favor of the OAGB procedure with a statistical significance (p = 0.00001) and no significant statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 0.00%). There was no significant RD for leak, bleeding, or marginal ulcer after the two revisional procedures. After conversion to OAGB, remission from GERD was 68.6% (81/118), and it was 80.6% (150/186) after conversion to RYGB with a RD = 0.10 (95% CI -0.04, 0.24), no statistical significance (p = 0.19), and high heterogeneity (I2 = 96%). De novo GERD was 6.3% (16/255) after conversional OAGB, and it was 0.5% (1/180) after conversion to RYGB with a RD = -0.23 (95% CI -0.57, 0.11), no statistical significance (p = 0.16), and high heterogeneity (I2 = 92%).",10.1007/s00423-023-03175-x,0,,1,25
152,Long Biliopancreatic Limb Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass Versus One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass: a Randomized Controlled Study.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the gold standard in bariatric surgery. The one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) procedure, first introduced by Dr. Rutledge, has demonstrated a 25% greater weight loss efficiency than the traditional Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedure due to the substantially longer biliopancreatic limb (BPL). The current work aimed to compare the outcomes of OAGB and long BPL RYGB regarding weight loss and comorbidity resolution. This randomized controlled trial was done at our institution between September 2019 and January 2021. Patients who were candidates for bariatric surgery were randomly and equally allocated to two groups. Group A underwent OAGB, while group B underwent long BPL RYGB. Patients were followed up for 6 months postoperatively. This study included 62 patients equally allocated to OAGB or long BPL RYGB, with no dropouts during follow-up. At 6 months, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding postoperative BMI (P = 0.313) and the EBWL (P = 0.238). There was comparable remission of diabetes mellitus (P = 0.708), hypertension (P = 0.999), OSA (P = 0.999), joint pain (P = 0.999), and low back pain (P = 0.999). Seven patients in the OAGB group experienced reflux symptoms (P = 0.011), which were managed by proton pump inhibitors. Extending the BPL in RYGB provides weight loss and comorbidity remission comparable to that of OAGB. Some OAGB-related reflux cases remain a concern. However, they were sufficiently controlled with PPIs. Due to OAGB superior technical simplicity, long BPL RYGB should be preserved for cases whom are more risky for bile reflux.",10.1007/s11695-023-06631-1,0,,1,26
256,Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease as an Indication of Revisional Bariatric Surgery-Indication and Results-a Systematic Review and Metanalysis.,"This systematic review evaluates the indications and results of revisional bariatric surgery (RBS) in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). A systematic literature search and meta-analysis was performed for articles published by April 1, 2021. After examining 722 papers involving 17,437 patients, 48 studies were included (nâ€‰=â€‰915 patients). RBS for GERD was mostly reported after sleeve gastrectomy (nâ€‰=â€‰796, 87%) and one anastomosis gastric bypass (nâ€‰=â€‰62, 6.8%) and was performed due to intractable GERD (71.6%), GERD and weight issues (16%), and biliary reflux (6.2%). Mean follow-up of the studies was 31.5 (3-84) months. Pooled estimation of a meta-analysis of studies reported 7% of GERD following primary surgery needing RBS, in which 99% of the patients experienced remission.",10.1007/s11695-022-06183-w,0,,1,27
223,Surgical Management of Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease After One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass - a Systematic Review.,"Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) after one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) remains a concern. We reviewed the current literature on revisional surgery after OAGB for GORD. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed databases were searched. We identified 21 studies, appraising 13,658 OAGB patients. A total of 230 (1.6%) patients underwent revisional surgery for GORD. Revision to Roux-en-Y configuration was performed in 211 (91.7%) patients. Six (2.6%) patients had a Braun entero-enterostomy added to the OAGB. Thirteen (5.6%) patients underwent excluded stomach fundoplication (ESF). Reflux symptoms resolved in 112 (48.6%) patients, persisted in 13 (5.6%) patients, and were not reported in 105 (45.6%) patients. Revisional surgery after OAGB for GORD appears to be rare, and when required, conversion to Roux-en-Y configuration is the commonest choice.",10.1007/s11695-022-06301-8,0,,1,28
568,Bile Reflux is a Common Finding in the Gastric Pouch After One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass.,"Data on postoperative bile reflux after one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is lacking. Bile reflux scintigraphy (BRS) has been shown to be a reliable non-invasive tool to assess bile reflux after OAGB. We set out to study bile reflux after OAGB with BRS and endoscopy in a prospective series (RYSA Trial). Forty patients (29 women) underwent OAGB between November 2016 and December 2018. Symptoms were reported and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGE) was done preoperatively. Six months after OAGB, bile reflux was assessed in UGE findings and as tracer activity found in gastric tube and esophagus in BRS (follow-up rate 95%). Twenty-six patients (68.4%) had no bile reflux in BRS. Twelve patients (31.6%) had bile reflux in the gastric pouch in BRS and one of them (2.6%) had bile reflux also in the esophagus 6Â months postoperatively. Mean bile reflux activity in the gastric pouch was 5.2% (1-21%) of total activity. De novo findings suggestive of bile reflux (esophagitis, stomal ulcer, foveolar inflammation of gastric pouch) were found for 15 patients (39.5%) in postoperative UGE. BRS and UGE findings were significantly associated (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.022). Eight patients experienced de novo reflux symptoms at 6Â months, that were significantly associated with BRS and de novo UGE findings postoperatively (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.033 and 0.0005, respectively). Postoperative bile reflux in the gastric pouch after OAGB is a common finding in scintigraphy and endoscopy. The long-term effects of bile exposure will be analyzed in future reports after a longer follow-up. Clinical Trials Identifier NCT02882685.",10.1007/s11695-019-04353-x,0,,1,29
552,"Indications, Operative Techniques, and Outcomes for Revisional Operation Following Mini-Gastric Bypass-One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass: a Systematic Review.","In addition to being a relatively reversible and less complex operation, mini-gastric bypass-one anastomosis gastric bypass (MGB-OAGB) has demonstrated comparable weight loss and metabolic improvement rates with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). However, surgical strategies for managing its failures and late complications were poorly defined. This article aims to review the indications, operative techniques, and outcomes for revisional surgery following MGB-OAGB. A systematic review was performed using the PubMed database from 1997 to 2019. Of 179 included patients, 89 underwent revision to RYGB; 52 to sleeve gastrectomy (SG); 32 reversal to original anatomy; and 6 underwent partial revision with gastro-gastrostomy alone. Most common indications were severe malnutrition, chronic bile reflux, intractable marginal ulcerations, and insufficient weight loss. Postoperative complication rates ranged from 5 to 35%.",10.1007/s11695-019-04276-7,0,,1,30
760,[Evidence of the Mini-/One-anastomosis-gastric-Bypass for being a standard procedure in obesity and metabolic surgery].,"The Mini gastric bypass/One anastomosis gastric bypass (MGB/OAGB) was the third most commonly performed procedure in Germany, with 13.9% of all obesity and metabolic procedures in 2017 (StuDoQ|MBE). This article reviews the currently published evidence for MGB/OAGB and the historical evidence on one anastomosis reconstruction. AÂ systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE via PubMed and in Clinicaltrials.gov. from inception to 13 March 2018. AÂ total of 35Â studies met the inclusion criteria: 19Â retrospective studies, 8Â retrospective comparative trials, 2Â systematic reviews, 3 systematic reviews and meta-analyses and 3Â randomized clinical trials. A total of eight randomized clinical trials regarding MGB/OAGB are currently registered at Clinicaltrials.gov. In this study 35 eligible studies were included reporting data on >15,000 patients. The 30-day mortality rate ranged from 0-0.9% and severe complications needing intervention ranged from 0.8-7%, whereas perioperative morbidity ranged from 3.2-10.8%. The use of MGB/OAGB induced substantial weight loss with aÂ total weight loss of 31-38% after 1 year and 23-32% after 5Â years. Moreover, it showed aÂ resolution or improvement in all major obesity-related diseases. Studies evaluating endpoints, such as end organ damage in diabetes, reduction of cardiovascular events and extending survival are missing and are available only for the Roux-enÂ Y gastric bypass. This systematic review confirms the advantages of MGB/OAGB regarding weight loss and the antidiabetic effect in the short-term in comparison to Roux-enÂ Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. The role of bile reflux as aÂ possible risk factor for neoplastic lesions in the long-term remains aÂ point of discussion. The results of the registered randomized controlled trials will provide a better evidence in the future.",10.1007/s00104-018-0663-9,0,,1,31

The follow-up duration ranged from 6Â months to 12Â years. A marginal ulceration rate of 2.7% and an anaemia rate of 7.0% were reported. Approximately 2.0% of patients reported postoperative gastro-oesophageal reflux and 0.71% developed malnutrition. Excess weight loss at 6, 12, 24 and 60Â months was 60.68, 72.56, 78.2 and 76.6% respectively. Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension resolved in 83.7 and 66.94% respectively.

796,Comparison of safety and effectiveness between laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: A meta-analysis and systematic review.,"The laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass is a newly emerged surgical procedure in recent years. Owe to safe and simple process and effective outcomes, laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass has quickly become one of the most popular procedures in some countries. The safety and effectiveness of laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass versus laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy remain unclear. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library from inception to May 20, 2017. The methodological quality of Randomized Controlled Trials and non-Randomized Controlled Trials were, respectively, assessed by Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias and Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The meta-analysis was performed by RevMan 5.3 software. Patients receiving mini-gastric bypass had a lot of advantageous indexes than patients receiving sleeve gastrectomy, such as higher 1-year EWL% (excess weight loss), higher 5-year EWL%, higher T2DM remission rate, higher hypertension remission rate, higher obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) remission rate, lower osteoarthritis remission rate, lower leakage rate, lower overall late complications rate, higher ulcer rate, lower gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) rate, shorter hospital stay and lower revision rate. No significant statistical difference was observed on overall early complications rate, bleed rate, vomiting rate, anemia rate, and operation time between mini-gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. Mini-gastric bypass is a simpler, safer, and more effective bariatric procedure than laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Due to the biased data, small sample size and short follow-up time, our results may be unreliable. Large sample and multicenter RCT is needed to compare the effectiveness and safety between mini-gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. Future study should also focus on bile reflux, remnant gastric cancer, and long term effectiveness of mini-gastric bypass.",10.1097/MD.0000000000008924,0,,1,33
768,Outcomes of Mini vs Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: A meta-analysis and systematic review.,"Mini gastric bypass has been proved to be capable of achieving excellent metabolic results by numerous published studies. Compared to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, mini gastric bypass is a technically simpler and reversible procedure. However, comparative outcomes of the effectiveness between Mini gastric bypass and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass remain unclear. A systematic literature search was performed in Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane library from inception to February 9, 2018. For assessment of method quality, NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) and Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias were used for cohort study and randomized controlled trials, respectively. The meta-analysis was performed by RevMan 5.3 software. 10 cohort studies and 1 randomized controlled trial was included in our meta-analysis. The method quality of the 10 cohort studies was proved as high quality according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The randomized controlled trial was proved to have a low risk of bias according to Cochrane Collaboration's assessment. Patients receiving mini-gastric bypass had multiple advantageous indexes as compared with patients receiving Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Examples include: a higher 1-year EWL% (Pâ€¯<â€¯0.05), higher 2-year EWL% (Pâ€¯<â€¯0.05), higher type 2 diabetes mellitus remission rate, as well as a shorter operation time (Pâ€¯<â€¯0.05). No significant statistical difference was observed in hypertension remission rate, mortality, leakage rate, GERD rate, or hospital stay between mini gastric bypass and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Mini gastric bypass seems to be a simpler procedure with a better weight reduction effect. This seems to also be the case regarding remission rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus when using Mini gastric bypass in comparison to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. A small sample size and biased data may have influenced the stability of our results. In light of this, surgeons should treat our results in a conservative way. Larger sample size and multi-center randomized control trials are needed to compare the effectiveness and safety between mini-gastric bypass and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.",10.1016/j.ijsu.2018.05.009,0,,1,34
126,One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass Versus Sleeve Gastrectomy for Obesity: a Systemic Review and Meta-analysis.,"A long-lasting and efficient method of managing obesity and therapeutic associated comorbidities is bariatric surgery. However, a debated comparison between one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) and sleeve gastrectomy is still essential (SG). The goal of this study is to evaluate outcomes using RCT and NRCT from 2015 to 2022. By contrasting the OAGB and SG for bariatric surgery from January 2015 to September 2022, an RCT and NRCT were prospectively gathered using the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and MEDLINE databases of published research. This meta-statistical analysis was carried out in RevMan 5.4, and the best effect model was selected based on heterogeneity. Twelve retrospective studies describing 6344 patients (3725 OAGB and 2619 SG) satisfied the inclusion criteria. A statistically significant result was in %EWL first year (MD = 8.03, 95% CI: 4.54-11.52, P < 0.05), second year (MD = 8.94, 95% CI: 2.95-14.94, P < 0.05), third year (MD = 8.93, 95% CI: 5.75-12.10, P < 0.05), fourth year (MD = 15.09, 95% CI:0.87-29.31, P < 0.05), and fifth year (MD = 14.25, 95% CI: 5.34, P < 0.05). OAGB was associated with a lower rate of remission in dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hemorrhage. However, OAGB increased the incidence of GERD and leakage. In terms of weight loss and comorbidity remission, OAGB is more effective than SG, although postoperative consequences are rather comparable between the two methods.",10.1007/s11605-023-05782-x,0,,1,35
557,Weight Loss and Vomiting 1 Year After Banded Versus Non-banded One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass: a Prospective Randomized Trial.,"The weight loss outcomes after banded one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) remain to be determined. To compare weight loss and vomiting 1Â year after banded versus non-banded OAGB. This is a prospective, open-label, randomized study, which evaluated 33 individuals with morbid obesity, which underwent banded (16 individuals) and non-banded OAGB (17 individuals) and were followed up for 12Â months. Weight loss (percentages of total weight loss-%TWL-and excess weight loss-%EWL) and occurrence of vomiting were assessed and compared before surgery and after 6 and 12Â months. At baseline, there were no differences between groups in regard to age, gender, and body mass index (BMI). At 6 and 12Â months post-op, and the overall mean %TWL regardless of band use was 22.4â€‰Â±â€‰7% and 29â€‰Â±â€‰6.9%, respectively, and the overall average %EWL regardless of band use was 66.8â€‰Â±â€‰22.9% and 86.3â€‰Â±â€‰24%, respectively. %TWL did not differ between the banded and non-banded groups at 6 (21.8â€‰Â±â€‰6.8% vs. 23.1â€‰Â±â€‰7.4%; pâ€‰=â€‰0.7) and 12Â months post-op (27.5â€‰Â±â€‰6.6% vs. 30.4â€‰Â±â€‰7.1%; pâ€‰=â€‰0.3), as well as %EWL at 6 (67â€‰Â±â€‰22.9% vs. 67.6â€‰Â±â€‰23.6%; pâ€‰=â€‰0.6) and 12Â months post-op (83.5â€‰Â±â€‰24.4% vs. 89â€‰Â±â€‰24.1%; pâ€‰=â€‰0.4). The occurrence of vomiting did not significantly differ between banded and non-banded OAGB at 6 (12.5% vs. 11.8%; pâ€‰=â€‰0.9) and 12Â months post-op (12.5% vs. 5.9%; pâ€‰=â€‰0.5). OAGB led to an overall satisfactory weight loss after 1Â year, regardless of band use. Banded OAGB did not lead to neither significantly higher weight loss nor more vomiting than non-banded OAGB 1Â year after surgery.",10.1007/s11695-020-04393-8,0,,1,36
124,Marginal Ulcers Following One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Marginal ulcer (MU) is an uncommon but significant complication following one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). Our study aims to understand the incidence rates, risk factors, and management of MU following OAGB. MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were examined to identify all studies on OAGB where authors had reported on MU. Data were collected on basic demographics, incidence rates, risk factors, and management of this condition. Thirty-two studies involving 8868 patients were analysed. The mean age and body mass index (BMI) of patients in these studies were 40.9 Â± 4.5 years and 47.6 Â± 5.6 kg/m2, respectively. Among the patient cohort, approximately 72% were female, and 20.6% had preoperative gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The authors described prescribing proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) prophylaxis to 14.1% of patients after surgery. Two hundred twenty-eight patients were reported to have MU. The incidence of MU was 2.59% (95% CI 1.89-3.52), of which 53 patients presented within 12 months, 24 patients presented after 31 months, and five patients after 6 years. One hundred forty-six patients did not have presentation time documented. Sixty-five patients were described to have MU diagnosed on endoscopy, of which 54 were symptomatic and 11 were asymptomatic. The authors were, however, not specific on the choice of investigation for the remaining 163 patients. Of patients, 89.7% were treated conservatively with PPIs, whilst 10.3% had surgery to treat MU. Marginal ulcer is an uncommon complication following OAGB. The majority of patients are treated conservatively with PPIs. Larger, well-designed studies reporting on risk factors, investigation, and management of MU following OAGB are warranted.",10.1007/s11695-023-06762-5,0,,1,37
1067,Effect of sleeve gastrectomy on type 2 diabetes as an alternative treatment modality to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: systemic review and meta-analysis.,"Until recently, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) was the most frequently performed procedure in bariatric surgery. In the last decade, sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has emerged as a more popular, simpler, and less morbid form of bariatric surgery. This study compares the efficacy of SG and RYGB for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Systemic review and meta-analysis. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched for entries up to December 2013. Search terms included ""Sleeve gastrectomy,"" ""Gastric bypass,"" and ""Type 2 diabetes mellitus."" The chosen articles described both ""Sleeve gastrectomy"" and ""Gastric bypass"" and included over 1 year of follow-up data. Data analysis was performed with Review Manager 5.2 and SPSS version 20. The data set is comprised of 3 retrospective clinical studies, 6 prospective clinical studies, and 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which involved 429 patients in the SG group and 428 patients in the RYGB group. In nonrandomized clinical studies, SG displayed similar efficacy in remission of T2D compared with the standard RYGB. In the RCTs, SG had a lower effect than that of RYGB. T2D remission was not correlated with the percent of excess weight loss for either procedure. Based on the current evidence, SG has a similar effect on T2D remission as RYGB.",10.1016/j.soard.2015.03.001,,,,38
871,Quality of Life 1Â Year After Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy Versus Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: a Randomized Controlled Trial Focusing on Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease.,"Bariatric surgery is the only treatment option that achieves sustained weight loss in obese patients and that also has positive effects on obesity-related comorbidities. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) seems to achieve equal weight loss as laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), but there is still much debate about the quality of life (QOL) after LSG, mainly concerning the association with gastroesophageal reflux. Our hypothesis is that QOL after LSG is comparable with QOL after LRYGB. Between February 2013 and February 2014, 150 patients were randomized to undergo either LSG or LRYGB in our clinic. Differences in QOL were compared between groups by using multiple QOL questionnaires at follow-up moments preoperatively and 2 and 12Â months after surgery. After 12Â months of follow-up, 128 patients had returned the questionnaires. Most QOL questionnaires showed significant improvement in scores between the preoperative moment and after 12Â months of follow-up. The Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaire (GerdQ) score deteriorated in the LSG group after 2Â months, but recovered again after 12Â months. After 2Â months of follow-up, the mean GerdQ score was 6.95Â Â±Â 2.14 in the LSG group versus 5.50Â Â±Â 1.49 in the LRYGB group (pÂ <Â 0.001). After 1Â year, the mean GerdQ score was 6.63Â Â±Â 2.26 in the LSG group and 5.60Â Â±Â 1.07 in the LRYGB group (pÂ =Â 0.001). This randomized controlled trial shows that patients who underwent LSG have significantly higher GerdQ scores at both 2 and 12Â months postoperatively than patients who underwent LRYGB, whereas overall QOL did not differ significantly.",10.1007/s11695-017-2688-4,,,,39
275,Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus best medical treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults with body mass index between 27 and 32Â kg/m2: A 5-year randomized controlled trial.,"To evaluate the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) versus best medical treatment in Asians with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and class I obesity. In this 5-year single-centre, open-label randomized controlled trial, participants were randomized to RYGB or medical treatment including newer classes of diabetes medications (ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT02041234). The primary endpoint was diabetes remission defined as HbA1cÂ â‰¤Â 6% (â‰¤42Â mmol/mol) and discontinuation of glucose-lowering medication at 12Â months post-intervention and beyond. Glycaemia and weight changes were assessed. Continuous glucose monitoring was performed. Of 28 subjects randomized, 26 were analyzed in the final cohort (14 medical, 12 RYGB; age:44Â Â±Â 10Â years, 34.6% males, BMI:29.4Â Â±Â 1.6Â kg/m2). At 12Â months, 50% of RYGB subjects achieved diabetes remission; 83% stopped all glucose-lowering medications. By year 5, 42% were in remission. None attained diabetes remission in the medical group. Percentage declines in fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c and BMI were significantly greater in the RYGB arm (all PÂ <Â 0.05). Early improvements in glycaemic variability and time in range were similar in both treatment arms. Hypoglycaemia and surgical complications were observed in some RYGB subjects. Over 5Â years, RYGB outperforms best medical treatment in glycemia and weight improvements for Asians with T2DM and class I obesity.",10.1016/j.diabres.2022.109900,,,,40
972,Weight loss and improvement of lipid profiles in morbidly obese patients after laparoscopic one-anastomosis gastric bypass: 2-year follow-up.,"Obesity is the most frequent chronic metabolic disease globally. There is a direct correlation between increasing body mass index (BMI) and elevated total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and triglycerides (Tg), and an inverse correlation with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL); all these lipid derangements are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Our aim was to evaluate lipid profiles in morbidly obese patients before and after one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) performed at a single-center during a 2-year follow-up. A prospective, observational and descriptive study was carried out, including morbidly obese patients with at least one lipid abnormality, who underwent laparoscopic OAGB. Lipid profiles were evaluated preoperatively and at different intervals during a 2-year follow-up. A total of 150 patients were included (73Â % females and 27Â % males). Mean age was 45.83Â Â±Â 10.65Â years, mean BMI was 42.82Â kg/m2Â Â±Â 6.43, and mean weight was 116.23Â kgÂ Â±Â 22.70; 2Â years after surgery, the latter two decreased to 24.73Â Â±Â 4.43 (pÂ <Â 0.001) and 67.34Â Â±Â 13.35 (pÂ <Â 0.001), respectively, thus leading to a mean weight loss (WL) of 48.85Â kgÂ Â±Â 15.64 and mean %excess WL of 71.87Â Â±Â 13.41. Tg, TC and LDL levels significantly decreased: 123.60Â Â±Â 56.34 versus 84.79Â Â±Â 33.67, 194.33Â Â±Â 43.90 versus 173.65Â Â±Â 34.84, and 124.47Â Â±Â 36.07 versus 97.36Â Â±Â 25.05, respectively (pÂ <Â 0.001); HDL levels significantly increased: 43.61Â Â±Â 9.85 versus 61.56Â Â±Â 12.63 (pÂ <Â 0.001). OAGB leads to substantial and durable WL in morbidly obese patients after a 2-year follow-up. Postoperative lipid profiles significantly improved; these changes translate into theoretical relevant cardiovascular risk benefits.",10.1007/s00464-016-4990-y,,,,41
93,Gastroesophageal reflux disease following laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic roux-en-Y gastric bypass: meta-analysis and systematic review of 5-year data.,"To compare 5-year gastroesophageal reflux outcomes following Laparoscopic Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (LVSG) and Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) based on high quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We conducted a sub-analysis of our systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of primary LVSG and LRYGB procedures in adults for 5-year post-operative complications (PROSPERO CRD42018112054). Electronic databases were searched from January 2015 to July 2021 for publications meeting inclusion criteria. The Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman random effects model was utilized to estimate weighted mean differences where meta-analysis was possible. Bias and certainty of evidence was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2 and GRADE. Four RCTs were included (LVSG n = 266, LRYGB n = 259). An increase in adverse GERD outcomes were observed at 5 years postoperatively in LVSG compared to LRYGB in all outcomes considered: Overall worsened GERD, including the development de novo GERD, occurred more commonly following LVSG compared to LRYGB (OR 5.34, 95% CI 1.67 to 17.05; p = 0.02; I2 = 0%; (Moderate level of certainty); Reoperations to treat severe GERD (OR 7.22, 95% CI 0.82 to 63.63; p = 0.06; I2 = 0%; High level of certainty) and non-surgical management for worsened GERD (OR 3.42, 95% CI 1.16 to 10.05; p = 0.04; I2 = 0%; Low level of certainty) was more common in LVSG patients. LVSG is associated with the development and worsening of GERD symptoms compared to LRYGB at 5 years postoperatively leading to either introduction/increased pharmacological requirement or further surgical treatment. Appropriate patient/surgical selection is critical to minimize these postoperative risks.",10.1093/dote/doad063,,,,42
1157,Surgery for weight loss in adults.,"Bariatric (weight loss) surgery for obesity is considered when other treatments have failed. The effects of the available bariatric procedures compared with medical management and with each other are uncertain. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003 and most recently updated in 2009. To assess the effects of bariatric surgery for overweight and obesity, including the control of comorbidities. Studies were obtained from searches of numerous databases, supplemented with searches of reference lists and consultation with experts in obesity research. Date of last search was November 2013. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing surgical interventions with non-surgical management of obesity or overweight or comparing different surgical procedures. Data were extracted by one review author and checked by a second review author. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and evaluated overall study quality utilising the GRADE instrument. Twenty-two trials with 1798 participants were included; sample sizes ranged from 15 to 250. Most studies followed participants for 12, 24 or 36 months; the longest follow-up was 10 years. The risk of bias across all domains of most trials was uncertain; just one was judged to have adequate allocation concealment.All seven RCTs comparing surgery with non-surgical interventions found benefits of surgery on measures of weight change at one to two years follow-up. Improvements for some aspects of health-related quality of life (QoL) (two RCTs) and diabetes (five RCTs) were also found. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate. Five studies reported data on mortality, no deaths occurred. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in four studies and ranged from 0% to 37% in the surgery groups and 0% to 25% in the no surgery groups. Between 2% and 13% of participants required reoperations in the five studies that reported these data.Three RCTs found that laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (L)(RYGB) achieved significantly greater weight loss and body mass index (BMI) reduction up to five years after surgery compared with laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). Mean end-of-study BMI was lower following LRYGB compared with LAGB: mean difference (MD) -5.2 kg/mÂ² (95% confidence interval (CI) -6.4 to -4.0; P < 0.00001; 265 participants; 3 trials; moderate quality evidence). Evidence for QoL and comorbidities was very low quality. The LRGYB procedure resulted in greater duration of hospitalisation in two RCTs (4/3.1 versus 2/1.5 days) and a greater number of late major complications (26.1% versus 11.6%) in one RCT. In one RCT the LAGB required high rates of reoperation for band removal (9 patients, 40.9%).Open RYGB, LRYGB and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) led to losses of weight and/or BMI but there was no consistent picture as to which procedure was better or worse in the seven included trials. MD was -0.2 kg/mÂ² (95% CI -1.8 to 1.3); 353 participants; 6 trials; low quality evidence) in favour of LRYGB. Â No statistically significant differences in QoL were found (one RCT). Six RCTs reported mortality; one death occurred following LRYGB. SAEs were reported by one RCT and were higher in the LRYGB group (4.5%) than the LSG group (0.9%). Reoperations ranged from 6.7% to 24% in the LRYGB group and 3.3% to 34% in the LSG group. Effects on comorbidities, complications and additional surgical procedures were neutral, except gastro-oesophageal reflux disease improved following LRYGB (one RCT). One RCT of people with a BMI 25 to 35 and type 2 diabetes found laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass resulted in greater weight loss and improvement of diabetes compared with LSG, and had similar levels of complications.Two RCTs found that biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BDDS) resulted in greater weight loss than RYGB in morbidly obese patients. End-of-study mean BMI loss was greater following BDDS: MD -7.3 kg/mÂ² (95% CI -9.3 to -5.4); P < 0.00001; 107 participants; 2 trials; moderate quality evidence). QoL was similar on most domains. In one study between 82% to 100% of participants with diabetes had a HbA1c of less than 5% three years after surgery. Reoperations were higher in the BDDS group (16.1% to 27.6%) than the LRYGB group (4.3% to 8.3%). One death occurred in the BDDS group.One RCT comparing laparoscopic duodenojejunal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy versus LRYGB found BMI, excess weight loss, and rates of remission of diabetes and hypertension were similar at 12 months follow-up (very low quality evidence). QoL, SAEs and reoperation rates were not reported. No deaths occurred in either group.One RCT comparing laparoscopic isolated sleeve gastrectomy (LISG) versus LAGB found greater improvement in weight-loss outcomes following LISG at three years follow-up (very low quality evidence). QoL, mortality and SAEs were not reported. Reoperations occurred in 20% of the LAGB group and in 10% of the LISG group.One RCT (unpublished) comparing laparoscopic gastric imbrication with LSG found no statistically significant difference in weight loss between groups (very low quality evidence).Â  QoL and comorbidities were not reported. No deaths occurred. Two participants in the gastric imbrication group required reoperation. Surgery results in greater improvement in weight loss outcomes and weight associated comorbidities compared with non-surgical interventions, regardless of the type of procedures used. When compared with each other, certain procedures resulted in greater weight loss and improvements in comorbidities than others. Outcomes were similar between RYGB and sleeve gastrectomy, and both of these procedures had better outcomes than adjustable gastric banding. For people with very high BMI, biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch resulted in greater weight loss than RYGB. Duodenojejunal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic RYGB had similar outcomes, however this is based on one small trial. Isolated sleeve gastrectomy led to better weight-loss outcomes than adjustable gastric banding after three years follow-up. This was based on one trial only. Â Weight-related outcomes were similar between laparoscopic gastric imbrication and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in one trial. Across all studies adverse event rates and reoperation rates were generally poorly reported. Most trials followed participants for only one or two years, therefore the long-term effects of surgery remain unclear.",10.1002/14651858.CD003641.pub4,,,,43

Simultaneously compare LSG and LRYGB in terms of weight loss and morbimortality over a 36-month follow-up period. University hospital and bariatric surgery centers, France. Prospective, comparative study between LSG and RYGBP. The primary endpoint of this study was a joint hypothesis during the 36-month follow-up: the first primary outcome pertained to the frequency of patients with an excess weight loss (EWL) greater than 50% (% EWL>50%) after LSG or RYGB; the second primary outcome was defined as a composite endpoint of at least one major complication. Secondary objectives were regression of comorbidities and improvement in quality of life. Two hundred and seventy-seven patients were included (91 RYGBP, 186 LSG). The mean age was 41.1Â±11.1 years, and average preoperative body mass index of 45.3Â±5.5kg/m2. After 36months, the %EWL>50% was not inferior in the case of LSG (82.2%) relative to LRYGB (82.1%); while major complications rates were significantly higher in LRYGB (15.4%) vs. LSG (5.4%, P=0.005). After 36months, all secondary objectives were comparable between groups while only gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) increased in LSG group and decreased in LRYGB group. LSG was found non-inferior to LRYGB with respect to weight loss and was associated with lower risk of major complications during a 3-year follow-up.

Patients with body mass index (BMI) 40-50Â kg/m2 are at more risk of weight regain and relapse of comorbidities. There is a controversy on the optimum alimentary (AL) and biliopancreatic (BPL) limb lengths to be used in RYGB to achieve weight loss and remission of comorbidities without causing nutritional deficiencies in those patients. hundred-and-fifty patients with BMI between 40 and 50Â kg/m2 were divided equally into 2 groups undergoing standard RYGB (S-RYGB) with AL:150Â cm and BPL: 50Â cm and long biliopancreatic RYGB (L-RYGB) with AL: 100Â cm and BPL: 100Â cm. BMI, % of total weight loss (%TWL), effect on diabetes (DM), hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia, and nutritional statuses were recorded at 1, 2, and 3Â years. Only 64/75 patients in S-RYGB and 57/75 patients in L-RYGB completed the study. L-RYGB had faster weight loss, higher %TWL, and less BMI than S-RYGB with the maintenance of achieved weight. L-RYGB had better control of DM and dyslipidemia than S-RYGB. There were no significant differences in nutritional status between S-RYGB and L-RYGB rather than lower levels of calcium and Hb and higher levels of PTH in L-RYGB yet they remain within the normal range. The application of L-RYGB helps in achieving faster weight loss for a longer period with better remission of associated comorbidities as DM, HTN, and dyslipidemia in patients with BMI 40-50Â kg/m2 but with effects on the nutritional status.",10.1007/s11695-021-05868-y,,,,45
374,Systematic review of the outcome of single-anastomosis sleeve ileal (SASI) bypass in treatment of morbid obesity with proportion meta-analysis of improvement in diabetes mellitus.,"Single-anastomosis sleeve ileal (SASI) bypass has emerged as a promising bariatric and metabolic procedure. We aimed to review the current literature on the outcome of SASI procedure in terms of weight loss, improvement in comorbidities, and complications. We conducted a systematic literature search, querying electronic databases and Google Scholar, for studies that reported the outcome of the SASI bypass. The main outcome measures of the review were change in body mass index (BMI), % of excess weight loss (%EWL), improvement in comorbidities, and complications after SASI bypass. This systematic review comprised ten studies including 941 patients with a median BMI of 45.6Â kg/m2. The median %EWL at 6 months was 59.4% and significantly (pÂ =Â 0.04) increased to 90.1% at 12 months. The weighted mean rate of improvement in diabetes mellitus was 99.1 (95%CI: 98.2-99.9, I2Â =Â 0). The crude percentages of patients with improvement in hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease were 51%, 76.6%, and 92%, respectively. The median operation time was 111.3, ranging between 75 and 148.4Â min. Complications were recorded in 116 (12.3%) patients. Longer common limb was associated with less %EWL at 6 months and less complications whereas larger anastomosis size was associated with higher weight loss and greater improvement in hypertension. SASI bypass was associated with good short-term outcomes in regard to weight loss and improvement in comorbidities, namely diabetes mellitus with an acceptably low complication rate.",10.1016/j.ijsu.2021.106024,,,,46
1353,Randomized clinical trial of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for the management of patients with BMIâ€‰<â€‰50 kg/m2.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is currently the gold standard bariatric procedure for the treatment of morbid obesity. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a relatively innovative procedure which has been increasingly applied lately as a sole bariatric procedure. A randomized trial was conducted in a Greek population to evaluate perioperative safety and 3-years results. Sixty patients with body mass index (BMI) â‰¤ 50Â Kg/m(2) were randomized to LRYGB or LSG. Patients were monitored for 3 years postoperatively and throughout the study period weight loss, in terms of percent excess weight loss (%EWL), early and late complications, improvement of obesity related comorbidities and nutritional deficiencies were compared between groups. There was no death in either group and there was no significant difference in early (10% after LRYGB and 13% after LSG, Pâ€‰>â€‰0.05) and late morbidity (10% in each group). Weight loss was significantly better after LSG in the first years of the study and at 3 years %EWL reached 62% after LRYGB and 68% after LSG (pâ€‰=â€‰0.13). There was no significant difference in the overall improvement of comorbidities. Nutritional deficiencies occurred at the same rate in the two groups except to vitamin B(12) deficiency which was more common after LRYGB (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.05). LSG and LRYGB are equally safe and effective in the amelioration of comorbidities, while LSG is associated with fewer postoperative metabolic deficiencies, without the need of supplementation. Furthermore, LSG is a promising bariatric procedure, equally effective to LRYGB at 3 years follow up on weight reduction.",10.1007/s11695-011-0479-x,,,,47
387,GERD after Bariatric Surgery. Can We Expect Endoscopic Findings?,"Background and Objectives: Bariatric surgery remains the gold standard treatment for morbidly obese patients. Roux-en-y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy are the most frequently performed surgeries worldwide. Obesity has also been related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The management of a preoperative diagnosis of GERD, with/without hiatal hernia before bariatric surgery, is mandatory. Endoscopy can show abnormal findings that might influence the final type of surgery. The aim of this article is to discuss and review the evidence related to the endoscopic findings after bariatric surgery. Materials and Methods: A systematic review of the literature has been conducted, including all recent articles related to endoscopic findings after bariatric surgery. Our review of the literature has included 140 articles, of which, after final review, only eight were included. The polled articles included discussion of the endoscopy findings after roux-en-y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Results: We found that the specific care of bariatric patients might include an endoscopic diagnosis when GERD symptoms are present. Conclusions: Recent evidence has shown that endoscopic follow-up after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy could be advisable, due to the pathological findings in endoscopic procedures in asymptomatic patients.",10.3390/medicina57050506,,,,48
1232,"""Mini"" gastric bypass: systematic review of a controversial procedure.","Mini gastric bypass is being explored by many bariatric surgeons as a standalone bariatric procedure. Several surgeons from different parts of the world have now published their extensive experience with this procedure. It appears to be an effective bariatric procedure with acceptable weight loss, co-morbidity resolution, and complication rates in the short and medium term. Its proponents claim that it is safer and easier than the gold standard Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. However, concerns with regard to symptomatic gastric or oesophageal biliary reflux requiring revisional surgery and long-term risk of gastric and oesophageal cancers persist. This paper reviews the published experience to date with this procedure and examines the surrounding controversy.",10.1007/s11695-013-1026-8,,,,49
887,"Bariatric surgery versus lifestyle interventions for severe obesity: 5-year changes in body weight, risk factors and comorbidities.","Changes in body weight (BW), risk factors and comorbidities 5 years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or different lifestyle interventions are compared. A total of 209 (75% women) severe obese adults were non-randomly allocated to: (A) RYGB (nâ€‰=â€‰58), (B) weight loss (WL) camp (nâ€‰=â€‰30), (C) residential intermittent programme (nâ€‰=â€‰64) or (D) hospital outpatient programme (nâ€‰=â€‰57). Body weight, risk factors and comorbidities were assessed at baseline, 1 and 5 years. A total of 89 and 54% completed the 1- and 5-year follow-up. The RYGB group experienced more WL at 5 years (-23.9%, 95% CI [-27.7, -20.0]) compared with lifestyle groups: (B) (-9.2%, 95% CI [-16.9, -1.5]), (C) (-4.1%, 95% CI [-8.0, -0.1]) and (D) (-4.1â€‰kg, 95% CI [-10.0, 1.8]) (all Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). No differences were observed between lifestyle groups, although groups B and C had significant WL after 5 years (all Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Plasma glucose and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were improved in the RYGB group at 5 years compared with lifestyle groups (all Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). More patients in the RYGB group experienced remission of hypertension (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). RYGB was associated with a lower BW, improved blood parameters and hypertension remission compared with lifestyle interventions at 5 years.

951,"Standard vs Distal Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in Patients With Body Mass Index 50 to 60: A Double-blind, Randomized Clinical Trial.","Up to one-third of patients undergoing bariatric surgery have a body mass index (BMI) of more than 50. Following standard gastric bypass, many of these patients still have a BMI greater than 40 after peak weight loss. To assess the efficacy and safety of standard gastric bypass vs distal gastric bypass in patients with a BMI of 50 to 60. Double-blind, randomized clinical parallel-group trial at 2 tertiary care centers in Norway (Oslo University Hospital and Vestfold Hospital Trust) between May 2011 and April 2013. The study included 113 patients with a BMI of 50 to 60 aged 20 to 60 years. The 2-year follow-up was completed in May 2015. Standard gastric bypass (alimentary limb, 150 cm) and distal gastric bypass (common channel, 150 cm), both with a biliopancreatic limb of 50 cm and a gastric pouch of about 25 mL. Primary outcome was the change in BMI from baseline until 2 years after surgery. Secondary outcomes were cardiometabolic risk factors, nutritional outcomes, adverse events, gastrointestinal symptoms, and health-related quality of life. At baseline, the mean age of the patients was 40 years (95% CI, 38-41 years), 65% were women, mean BMI was 53.5 (95% CI, 52.9-54.0), and mean weight was 158.8 kg (95% CI, 155.3-162.3 kg). The mean reduction in BMI was 17.8 (95% CI, 16.9-18.6) after standard gastric bypass and 17.2 (95% CI, 16.3-18.0) after distal gastric bypass, and the mean between-group difference was 0.6 (95% CI, -0.6 to 1.8; Pâ€‰=â€‰.32). Reductions in mean levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were greater after distal gastric bypass than standard gastric bypass, and between-group differences were 19 mg/dL (95% CI, 11-27 mg/dL ) and 28 mg/dL (95% CI, 21 to 34 mg/dL), respectively (Pâ€‰<â€‰.001 for both). Reductions in fasting glucose levels and hemoglobin A1c were greater after distal gastric bypass. Secondary hyperparathyroidism and loose stools were more frequent after distal gastric bypass. The number of adverse events and changes in health-related quality of life did not differ between the groups. Importantly, 1 patient developed liver failure and 2 patients developed protein-caloric malnutrition treated by elongation of the common channel following distal gastric bypass. Distal gastric bypass was not associated with a greater BMI reduction than standard gastric bypass 2 years after surgery. However, we observed different changes in cardiometabolic risk factors and nutritional markers between the groups. Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00821197.",10.1001/jamasurg.2016.2798,,,,51
1149,A meta-analysis of short-term outcomes of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and BMI â‰¤ 35 kg/m2 undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is effective for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with a body mass index (BMI) >35 kg/m(2). It is unknown whether it benefits those with a BMI â‰¤ 35 kg/m(2). In the last decade, the effect of bariatric procedures on metabolic outcomes in individuals who underwent surgery outside National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines (BMI â‰¤ 35 kg/m(2)) was both interesting and controversial. We performed a systematic analysis evaluating the effect of RYGB for T2DM patients with a BMI â‰¤ 35 kg/m(2). We searched databases (Embase, Ovid, PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure [CNKI], and Cochrane Library) and relevant journals between January 1980 and October 2013. Keywords used in electronic searching included 'diabetes', 'gastric bypass', 'BMI', and 'body mass index'. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients who underwent RYGB; (2) sample size â‰¥ 15; (3) patients with a BMI â‰¤ 35 kg/m(2); and (4) follow-up â‰¥ 12 months. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) data extracted from a database; (2) trials for sleeve gastrectomy; (3) trials for laparoscopic banding; (4) trials for bilio-pancreatic diversion; and (5) trials for duodenojejunal bypass. Participants and intervention type 2 diabetes patients with BMI â‰¤ 35 kg/m(2) who underwent RYGB. Two investigators reviewed all reported studies independently. Data were extracted according to previously defined endpoints. A meta-analysis was performed for these parameters, with homogeneity among different trials. Nine articles fulfilled inclusion criteria. After 12 months, patients with T2DM had a significant decrease in their BMI postoperatively (p < 0.00001, weighted mean difference [WMD] -7.42, 95 % confidence interval [CI] -8.87 to -5.97), and remission of diabetes (glucose: p < 0.00001, WMD -59.87, 95 % CI -67.74 to -52.01; hemoglobin A1c p < 0.00001, WMD -2.76, 95 % CI -3.41 to -2.11). There were no deaths in all trials, and the complication rate was between 6.7 and 25.9 %. Mean length of hospital stay was 2.00 to 3.20 days, and mean operative time was from 72.8 to 112.0 min. In terms of study limitations, publication and selection bias were unavoidable. Trials with small sample sizes were excluded, which may lead to a selection bias. RYGB was effective for T2DM patients with BMI â‰¤ 35 kg/m(2). Further clinical studies with long-term follow-up data are necessary to clarify this issue.",10.1007/s00268-014-2751-4,,,,52
1056,Long-term effects of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy versus roux-en-Y gastric bypass for the treatment of Chinese type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with body mass index 28-35 kg/m(2).,"To compare long term effects of two bariatric procedures for Chinese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 28-35 kg/m(2). Sixty four T2DM patients with Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) â‰§ 7.0 % were randomly assigned to receive laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedure. Weight, percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL), BMI, waist circumference, HbA1c, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and C-peptide were measured. Serum lipid levels were also measured during three-year postoperative follow-up visits. Fifty five patients completed the 36-month follow-up. Both groups had similar baseline anthropometric and biochemical measures. At the end point, 22 patients (78.6 %) in SG group and 23 patients (85.2 %) in RYGB group achieved complete remission of diabetes mellitus with HbA1c < 6.0 % (P = 0.525) and without taking diabetic medications, and 25 patients in each group (89.3 % vs. 92.6 %) gained successful treatment of diabetes with HbA1câ‰¦6.5 % (P = 0.100). Change in HbA1c, FBG and C peptide were comparable in the two groups. The RYGB group had significantly greater weight loss than the SG group [percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) of 31.0 % vs. 27.1 % (P = 0.049), %EWL of 92.3 % vs. 81.9 % (P = 0.003), and change in BMI of 11.0 vs. 9.1 kg/m(2)(P = 0.017), respectively]. Serum lipids in each group were also greatly improved. In this three-year study, SG had similar positive effects on diabetes and dyslipidemia compared to RYGB in Chinese T2DM patients with BMI of 28-35 kg/m(2).

Criteria for inclusion of articles were patients aged between 18 and 65 years; clinical trial; comparison between the two techniques; minimum five-year follow-up; outcome with weight loss assessment. The initial search identified 1940 articles, of which 185 publications were identified as clinical trials. One hundred and forty-one were excluded, 67 because they did not compare the two techniques, 57 not addressed weight loss and 17 were repeated articles. Thirty-four studies were retrieved for a more detailed analysis; 36 studies were excluded due to a follow-up of less than five years, and another compared the mini-gastric bypass. In total, seven studies were included in the systematic review, but there was no significant difference in three of them.

1243,DiaSurg 2 trial--surgical vs. medical treatment of insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with a body mass index between 26 and 35 kg/m2: study protocol of a randomized controlled multicenter trial--DRKS00004550.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a disease with high prevalence, associated with severe co-morbidities as well as being a huge burden on public health. It is known that glycemic control decreases long-term morbidity and mortality. The current standard therapy for T2DM is medical treatment. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) performed in obese patients showed remission of T2DM after bariatric surgery. Recent RCTs have shown bariatric procedures to produce a similar effect in non-morbidly and non-severely obese, insulin-dependent T2DM patients suggesting procedures currently used in bariatric surgery as new therapeutical approach in patients with T2DM. This study aims at investigating whether Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is an efficient treatment for non-severely obese T2DM patients in terms of preventing long-term complications and mortality. The DiaSurg 2 trial is a multicenter, open randomized controlled trial comparing RYGB including standardized medical treatment if needed to exclusive standardized medical treatment of T2DM (control group). The primary endpoint is a composite time-to-event endpoint (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, coronary bypass, percutaneous coronary intervention, non-fatal stroke, amputation, surgery for peripheral atherosclerotic artery disease), with a follow-up period of 8 years. Insulin-dependent T2DM patients aged between 30 and 65 years will be included and randomly assigned to one of the two groups. The experimental group will receive RYGB and, if needed, standardized medical care, whereas the control group will receive exclusive standardized medical care, both according to the national treatment guidelines for T2DM. Statistical analysis is based on Cox proportional hazards regression for the intention-to-treat population. Assuming a loss to follow-up rate of 20%, 200 patients will be randomly allocated to the comparison groups. A total sample size of n=400 is sufficient to ensure 80% power in a two-tailed significance test at alpha=5%. The DiaSurg2 trial will yield long-term data (8 years) on diabetes-associated morbidity and mortality in patients with insulin-dependent T2DM receiving either RYGB or standardized medical care. The trial protocol has been registered in the German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00004550.",10.1186/1745-6215-14-183,,,,55
509,Sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Two-year results from a Swedish multicenter randomized controlled trial.,"Obesity is a world-wide epidemic and it is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Few randomized controlled studies have compared the 2 most common surgical procedures, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in the treatment of obese patients with T2D. To compare diabetes remission rates (glycosylated hemoglobin â‰¤6.0%, without diabetes medications) in obese T2D patients (body mass index, 35-50) undergoing RYGB or SG. Three University Hospital clinics and 1 Regional Hospital in Sweden. Forty-nine patients with T2D were included. Twenty-five were randomized to RYGB and 24 to SG. There was no difference between groups regarding patient characteristics, duration of T2D, overall usage of antidiabetic medications, or glycosylated hemoglobin levels. All patients (100%) completed 1-year follow-up and 47 (95.9%) 2-year follow-up. Remission of T2D was not significantly different between the RYGB and SG, reaching 44% and 46% (n = 25 and n = 24, respectively, P = .897, power = .80) at 1 year, and 48% and 55% (n = 25 and n =Â 22, respectively, P = .654) at 2 years of follow-up. Similarly, mean glycosylated hemoglobin was improved in both groups at 1 and 2 years, with no significant differences between the groups (RYGB baseline versusÂ 1Â yr; mean Â± standard deviation: 7.9 Â± 1.5 versus 5.8 Â± .6%, P < .0001; versus 2 yr: 5.9 Â± .7%, P < .0001; SG baseline versus 1 yr: 8.2 Â± 1.9 versus 5.9 Â± .7%, P < .0001; versus 2 yr: 5.9 Â± 1.1%, PÂ <Â .0001). Total weight loss was not different but percentage excess weight loss was higher after RYGB compared with SG both at 1 and 2 years; mean Â± standard deviation: 78 Â± 22 versus 60 Â± 22%, and 76 Â± 24 versus 54 Â± 21%, respectively (P < .01 for both). Waist circumference also decreased significantly more in the RYGB group. Despite superior excess weight loss after RYGB, T2D remission rates did not differ significantly between RYGB and SG after 2 years. Long-term follow-up data are needed to define the role of SG in the treatment of patients with obesity and T2D.",10.1016/j.soard.2020.04.033,,,,56
1485,Long-long limb Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is more efficacious in treatment of type 2 diabetes and lipid disorders in super-obese patients.,"Super-obese patients can achieve adequate weight loss with long limb Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). These patients, however, might need longer intestinal limbs to control co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes, lipid disorders, hypertension, sleep apnea, and gastroesophageal reflux disorder. A total of 105 patients with a body mass index of > or =50 kg/m(2) were randomly divided into 2 similar groups regarding sex, age, and number of co-morbidities. All underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. In group 1, the length of the biliary limb was 50 cm and the length of the Roux limb was 150 cm. In group 2, the length of the biliary limb was 100 cm and the length of the Roux limb was 250 cm. The follow-up for both group was 48 months. Diabetes was controlled in 58% of group 1 and in 93% of group 2 (P <0.05). Lipid disorders improved in 57% of group 1 and in 70% of group 2 (P <0.05). No statistical difference was found in the control or improvement of hypertension, sleep apnea, or gastroesophageal reflux disorder. The excess weight loss was faster in group 1 but was similar in both groups at 48 months (70% in group 1 and 74% in group 2), with no statistical difference. Patients with longer biliary and Roux limbs achieved greater type 2 diabetes control, greater lipid disorder improvement, and showed a trend toward faster excess weight loss.",10.1016/j.soard.2007.12.016,,,,57
726,Comparative Effectiveness of Different Bariatric Procedures in Super Morbid Obesity.,"Super obesity (BMI â‰¥â€‰50Â kg/m2) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The best procedure to treat super obesity is not completely established. Our aim was to compare the effectiveness of bariatric procedures (adjustable gastric band [AGB], Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [RYGB], sleeve gastrectomy [SG]) in super obesity. Retrospective observational study of super obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery. Data was assessed preoperatively and in the 1st and 2nd years of follow-up. We evaluated 213 individuals, 77.9% female, age of 43.38â€‰Â±â€‰11.49Â years, and preoperative BMI of 54.53â€‰Â±â€‰4.54Â kg/m2; 19 submitted to AGB, 127 to RYGB, and 67 to SG. In the pre-surgical assessment, there were no significant differences in age, anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, glycemic profile, and lipid profile between the three surgical groups. The percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) in the 1st year was 67.58% in RYGB, 58.74% in SG, and 38.71% in AGB (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and the percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) was 36.29%, 31.59%, and 21.07%, respectively (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Two years after surgery (nâ€‰=â€‰147; follow-up rate of 69%), the %EWL and %TWL were significantly higher in the RYGB group (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). RYGB had a higher success rate (%EWL â‰¥â€‰50% and %TWL â‰¥â€‰20%) in both years of follow-up (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). In multiple linear regression, after adjusting for other covariates, RYGB was the only strong predictive factor of %EWL and %TWL (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). RYGB proved to be more effective in super obesity. The beneficial effects in weight loss were evident both 1 and 2Â years after the procedure, regardless of pre-surgical anthropometric characteristics.",10.1007/s11695-018-3519-y,,,,58
1463,Benefits to patients choosing preoperative weight loss in gastric bypass surgery: new results of a randomized trial.,"Historically, preoperative weight loss has been encouraged for patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery to decrease liver mass, technically facilitating the procedure. In an earlier prospective randomized trial investigating effects of preoperative weight loss on patients' clinical outcomes, we reported no differences in postoperative complications or weight-loss profiles at 6-month followup. This article demonstrates results of the same study, with 1-year followup. One hundred consecutive patients in an 18-month period preparing to undergo gastric bypass surgery at Stanford University Medical Center were selected. Fifty patients were randomly assigned to lose 10% or more of their excess body weight preoperatively, and 50 patients were assigned to no preoperative weight-loss requirements. After 1 year, patient demographics and data on postoperative complications, cure or improvement of comorbidities, and differences in weight-loss profiles were collected. At 1 year, the 2 groups had similar preoperative demographics and body mass indexes (BMIs). Patients in the weight-loss group, on average, lost 8.2% of their excess body weight preoperatively compared with the nonweight-loss group, which gained 1.1% (p = 0.007). After a year, the patients in both arms of the study showed no difference in weight, BMI, excess weight-loss, and number of remaining comorbidites. But when patients were divided according to those who had lost at least 5% of their excess body weight preoperatively, the 1-year results for excess weight-loss, weight, and BMI were much lower for the weight-loss group. Preoperative weight loss in patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery is safe and feasible. It should be encouraged, because it will markedly improve longterm weight loss.",10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2008.09.028,,,,59
1057,"Early Increases in Bile Acids Post Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Are Driven by Insulin-Sensitizing, Secondary Bile Acids.","Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the most effective treatment for morbid obesity and resolution of diabetes. Over the last decade, it has become well accepted that this resolution of diabetes occurs before significant weight loss; however, the mechanisms behind this effect remain unknown and could represent novel therapeutic targets for obesity and diabetes. Bile acids have been identified as putative mediators of these weight loss-independent effects. To identify the longitudinal changes in bile acids after RYGB, which may provide mechanistic insight into the weight loss-independent effects of RYGB. Observational study before/after intervention. Academic medical center. Samples were collected from morbidly obese patients (n = 21) before and after RYGB. RYGB. Seventeen individual bile acid species were measured preoperatively and at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Anthropometric, hormonal, and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp data were also examined to identify physiological parameters associated with bile acid changes. Fasting total plasma bile acids increased after RYGB; however, increases were bimodal and were observed only at 1 (P < .05) and 24 months (P < .01). One-month increases were secondary to surges in ursodeoxycholic acid and its glycine and taurine conjugates, bacterially derived bile acids with putative insulin-sensitizing effects. Increases at 24 months were due to gradual rises in primary unconjugated bile acids as well as deoxycholic acid and its glycine conjugate. Plasma bile acid changes were not significantly associated with any anthropometric or hormonal measures, although hepatic insulin sensitivity was significantly improved at 1 month. Overall findings suggest that bacterially derived bile acids may mediate the early improvements at 1 month after RYGB. Future studies should examine the changes in specific bile acid chemical species after bariatric procedures and bile acid-specific signaling changes.",10.1210/jc.2015-2467,,,,60
1435,The impact of gastric bypass on gastroesophageal reflux disease in patients with morbid obesity: a prospective study based on the Montreal Consensus.,"To assess the impact of gastric bypass (GBP) on gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) based on Montreal Consensus. In this study, 86 patients (25 men; aging 38 +/- 12 years; body mass index 45 [35-68 kg/m2]) were investigated for GERD before GBP and 6 months later. Esophageal and extraesophageal syndromes were assessed based on Montreal Consensus. Esophageal acid exposure and gastric pouch acidity were also evaluated. Overall prevalence of GERD was 64% before GBP and 33% after GBP (P < 0.0001). Typical reflux syndrome (TRS) was present in 47 patients (55%) preoperatively and disappeared in 39 of them (79%) post-GBP. Out of 39 patients with no symptoms, 4 (10%) developed TRS postoperatively (P < 0.0001). The chief TRS complaint changed from heartburn pre-GBP (96%) to regurgitation post-GBP (64%). Esophageal mucosa improved in 27, was unchanged in 51, and worsened in 8 patients (P = 0.001) in regard of esophagitis. Extraesophageal syndromes were present in 16 patients preoperatively and in none but one post-GBP (P = 0.0003). GERD-related well being and use of proton pump inhibitors were both improved after GBP. Total acid exposure decreased from a median (interquartile range, 25%-75%) of 5.1% (range, 2-8.2) to 1.1% (range, 0.2-4.8), P = 0.0002. Most patients (86%) showed and acid gastric pouch in fasting conditions post-GBP.

Whether regurgitation post-GBP corresponds to reflux disease or bad eating behavior deserves further studies.",10.1097/SLA.0b013e3181bdff20,,,,61
402,Long-term outcomes of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus medical therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has been widely used for type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients with overweight or obesity. However, the long-term outcomes of RYGB versus medical therapy have not been well compared. To evaluate the long-term outcomes of RYGB versus medical therapy for patients with T2D. University-affiliated hospital, China. Four electronic databases-PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov-were searched for articles published through February 2021. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials. Of 7 randomized controlled trials (15 articles), 477 patients were included: 239 were randomly divided into RYGB groups and 238 to medical therapy groups. Statistically higher rates of T2D remission were observed in RYGB groups at 1 year (relative risk [RR], 18.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.53- 71.70; P < .0001), 3 years (RR, 29.58; 95% CI, 5.92-147.82; P < .0001), and 5 years (RR, 16.92; 95% CI, 4.15-69.00; P < .0001). Meanwhile, statistically higher rates of achieving the American Diabetes Association's (ADA's) treatment goal were observed in RYGB groups at 1 year (RR, 3.99; 95% CI, 1.01-15.82; P = .05), 2 years (RR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.62- 5.48; P = .0004), 3 years (RR, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.33-7.49; P = .009), and 5 years (RR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.69-22.68; P = .006). This meta-analysis indicated that RYGB led to higher rates of T2D remission than medical therapy at 1, 3, and 5 years, as well as higher rates of achieving ADA's composite goal at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years.",10.1016/j.soard.2021.03.001,,,,62
32,Ten-Year Outcomes Following Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass vs Duodenal Switch for High Body Mass Index: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Results from long-term follow-up after biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (DS) are scarce. To compare weight loss, health outcomes, and quality of life 10 years or more after Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass (RYGB) and DS surgery in patients with severe obesity-that is, a body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 50 to 60. This open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted at 2 academic bariatric centers in Sweden and Norway. Sixty patients with a BMI of 50 to 60 were included from March 1, 2006, to August 31, 2007. Data were analyzed from August 12, 2022, to January 25, 2023. Laparoscopic RYGB or laparoscopic DS. The main outcome was change in BMI after 10 or more years. Secondary outcomes included anthropometric measures, lipid and glycemic profiles, bone mass density, adverse events, gastrointestinal tract symptoms, and health-related quality of life. Forty-eight of the original 60 patients (80%) were assessed after a median of 12 (range, 9-13) years (mean [SD] age, 48.0 [6.0] years; 35 women [73%]). At follow-up, the mean BMI reductions were 11.0 (95% CI, 8.3-13.7) for RYGB and 20.3 (95% CI, 17.6-23.0) for DS, with a mean between-group difference of 9.3 (95% CI, 5.4-13.1; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). Total weight loss was 20.0% (95% CI, 15.3%-24.7%) for RYGB and 33.9% (95% CI, 27.8%-40.0%) for DS (Pâ€‰=â€‰.001). Mean serum lipid levels, except high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and hemoglobin A1c, improved more in the DS group during follow-up. Bone mass was reduced for both groups from 5 to 10 years, with lower bone mass after DS at 10 years. Quality-of-life scores (Obesity-Related Problem Scale and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey) were comparable across groups at 10 years. The total number of adverse events was higher after DS (135 vs 97 for RYGB; Pâ€‰=â€‰.02). More patients in the DS group developed vitamin deficiencies (21 vs 11 for RYGB; Pâ€‰=â€‰.008) including 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency (19 for DS vs 9 for RYGB; Pâ€‰=â€‰.005). Four of 29 patients in the DS group (14%) developed severe protein-caloric malnutrition, of whom 3 (10%) underwent revisional surgery. In this randomized clinical trial, BMI reduction was greater after DS, but RYGB had a better risk profile over 10 years. Biliopancreatic diversion with DS may not be a better surgical strategy than RYGB for patients with a BMI of 50 to 60.

1497,Histological esophagitis before and after surgical treatment of morbid obesity (Capella technique): a prospective study.,"The effects of vertical banded gastroplasty/Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (Capella) on the esophageal mucosa of patients with histological esophagitis are poorly understood. To evaluate long-term effects, we investigated the persistence, aggravation or disappearance of histological esophagitis in patients with morbid obesity and reflux esophagitis (diagnosed by endoscopic biopsy) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Twenty-one patients with morbid obesity and esophagitis (histological diagnosis) were submitted to gastric bypass (Fobi-Capella technique) and underwent upper endoscopy and esophageal biopsy during the late postoperative period. The mean age of the patients was 42.57 +/- 7.49 years (30 to 56). Nineteen (90.48%) patients were women, and two (9.52%) were men. Before surgery, the patients presented a mean weight of 124.26 +/- 19.09 kg and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 48.46 +/- 6.37 kg/m(2). Thirteen (61.90%) patients had endoscopic esophagitis before surgery. The mean weight and BMI were 81.65 +/- 13.16 kg and 31.91 +/- 4.99 kg/m(2), respectively, during the late postoperative period (29.80 +/- 8.91 months). The mean percentage of excess weight loss was 68.7 +/- 14.6%. Among the 21 patients with a preoperative histological diagnosis of reflux esophagitis, five (23.18%) had the same diagnosis after surgery, and four (19.04%) continued to present findings of endoscopic esophagitis. Vertical banded gastroplasty/Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (Capella technique) is effective in the treatment of reflux esophagitis. No association was observed between the percentage of excess weight loss and improvement of esophagitis.",10.1007/s11695-008-9447-5,,,,64
629,Banded versus nonbanded Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Bariatric surgery is remarkably effective in achieving weight loss and improving obesity-related co-morbidities; however, efforts still continue to improve its long-term outcomes. Particularly, banded Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has been scrutinized in comparison to standard (nonbanded) RYGB in terms of benefits and postoperative complications. This study aims to compare the safety and efficacy of banded versus nonbanded RYGB. Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A meta-analysis of high-quality studies that compared banded and nonbanded RYGB was conducted through February 2019 by systematically searching multiple electronic databases. Published RCTs comparing these 2 procedures were included to pool the data on excess weight loss, food tolerability, and postoperative complications. Three RCTs were eligible to be included in this meta-analysis, comprising a total of 494 patients (247 in each group). Two of the RCTs provided 2-year postoperative data, and 1 study reported 5-year outcome. Age ranged from 21 to 50 years, and body mass index ranged from 42 to 65 kg/m2. Percentage of excess weight loss was significantly greater with banded RYGB than with nonbanded RYGB (mean difference 5.63%; 95% CI 3.26-8.00; P < .05). Postoperative food intolerance, emesis, and dysphagia were more common after banded RYGB (odds ratio 3.76; 95% CI 2.27-6.24; PÂ < .001). Nevertheless, major postoperative complications did not significantly differ between the 2Â groups. Findings of this meta-analysis of RCTs indicate that in a medium-term follow-up, excess weight loss with banded RYGB would be 5% greater than that with the nonbanded RYGB (about 1 point difference in body mass index) at the expense of more food intolerance and postoperative vomiting; however, the frequency of postoperative complications would not be significantly different.",10.1016/j.soard.2019.02.011,,,,65
1483,Incidence of marginal ulcer 1 month and 1 to 2 years after gastric bypass: a prospective consecutive endoscopic evaluation of 442 patients with morbid obesity.,"Marginal ulcer (MU) is an occasional complication after gastric bypass. We studied the incidence of this complication by a prospective routine endoscopic evaluation. 441 morbidly obese patients were studied prospectively. There were 358 women and 97 men, with mean age 41 years and mean BMI 43 kg/m(2). An endoscopic evaluation was performed in all 1 month after surgery, which was repeated in 315 patients (71%) 17 months after surgery, independent of the presence or absence of symptoms. Patients were submitted either to laparotomic resectional gastric bypass (360 patients), employing a circularstapler-25 or to laparoscopic gastric bypass (81 patients), in whom a hand-sewn anastomosis was performed. One month after surgery, 15 patients (4.1%) of the 360 laparotomic gastric bypass and 10 (12.3%) of the 81 laparoscopic gastric bypass presented an ""early"" marginal ulcer (p < 0.02). Seven patients among the 25 with MU were asymptomatic (28%). Endoscopy was repeated 17 months after surgery. Among 290 patients with no early MU, one patient (0.3%) presented a ""late"" MU 13 months after surgery. From the 25 patients with ""early"" MU, one patient (4%) presented a ""late"" MU. All these patients were treated with PPIs. By performing prospective routine endoscopic study 1 month and 17 months after gastric bypass, two different behaviors were seen regarding the appearance MU: (a) ""early"" MU, 1 month after surgery in mean 6% and (b) ""late"" MU, in a very small proportion of patients (0.6%). Among patients with ""early"" MU, those who had undergone resectional gastric bypass showed significantly less ulcers compared to those patients in whom the excluded distal gastric segment had been left in situ. The operative method may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of MU after gastric bypass.",10.1007/s11695-008-9588-6,,,,66
645,Conventional Versus Distal Laparoscopic One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass: a Randomized Controlled Trial with 1-Year Follow-up.,"There is no consensus on the ideal small bowel length that should be bypassed in laparoscopic one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). This study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of conventional versus distal techniques of laparoscopic OAGB. This randomized controlled trial involved 60 adults with morbid obesity scheduled for laparoscopic OAGB randomly assigned to one of the two techniques; conventional technique (fixed anastomosis 200Â cm from the ligament of Treitz) and distal technique (anastomosis 400Â cm from the ileocecal valve). Total small bowel length (TSBL) was measured in all cases. Quality of life was assessed using the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI). Outcome measures were excess body weight loss percentage (EBWL%), resolution of associated comorbidities, frequency of nutritional deficiencies, and quality of life. No patients were lost to follow-up. The two groups were comparable in TSBL, EBWL%, and complete resolution of comorbidities up to 12Â months. The percentage of afferent loop length to TSBL was significantly higher in the distal group (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) but was not correlated with EBWL%. The levels of hemoglobin, cholesterol, triglycerides, iron, and albumin were significantly lower and parathormone hormone was higher in the distal group. The GIQLI score was significantly higher in the conventional group during follow-up. OAGB achieves optimum results when the afferent loop length is 200Â cm; bypassing more than 200Â cm does not improve weight loss or comorbidity resolution. Measuring TSBL is recommended to avoid excessive small bowel shortening that increases the risk of nutritional consequences.",10.1007/s11695-019-03991-5,,,,67
142,Metabolic bariatric surgery as a therapeutic option for patients with type 2 diabetes: A meta-analysis and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"To compare different types of metabolic surgery with non-surgical therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The present network meta-analysis (NMA) includes randomized clinical trials (duration â‰¥â€‰52â€‰weeks) comparing different surgery techniques with non-surgical therapy in diabetes patients. The primary endpoints were endpoint HbA1c, body mass index (BMI) and diabetes remission. The secondary endpoints included fasting plasma glucose, lipid profile, blood pressure, arterial hypertension and dyslipidaemia remission, quality of life and surgical adverse events. Indirect comparisons of different types of surgery were performed by NMA. Mean and 95% confidence intervals for continuous variables, and the Mantel-Haenzel odds ratio for categorial variables, were calculated. The types of surgical procedure included laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), bilio-pancreatic diversion (BPD), greater curvature plication (GCP), one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) and Duodeno-Jejunal bypass. Thirty-six trials were included. Metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) was associated with a significantly higher reduction of HbA1c, diabetes remission and BMI compared with medical therapy. In the NMA, a significant reduction of HbA1c was observed with OAGB and SG. Complete diabetes remission significantly increased with all surgical procedures in comparison with non-surgical therapy, except for GCP. In addition, only BPD, RYGB and OAGB were associated with a significant reduction of BMI. MBS is an effective option for the treatment of T2D in patients with obesity. Further long-term trials of appropriate quality are needed for assessing the risk-benefit ratio in some patient cohorts, such as those with a BMI of less than 35â€‰kg/m2 and aged older than 65â€‰years.",10.1111/dom.15117,,,,68
1163,Systematic review and meta-analysis of medium-term outcomes after banded Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis focused exclusively on intermediate-term outcomes for the banded Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (B-RYGB). B-RYGB articles published from 1990 to 2013 were identified through MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, and SpringerLink databases augmented by manual reference review. Articles were assigned an evidence level (Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine [Oxford UK] criteria) and Jadad quality score (randomized controlled trials). Simple and weighted means (95% confidence interval (CI)) for excess weight loss (EWL) at follow-up (1-10+ years) were calculated. At 5 years, a pooled estimate for BMI (kg/m(2)) change (weighted mean difference and 95% CI) for banded bypass patients was computed. Rates for weighted mean complications, non-band- and band-related reoperations, and overall comorbidity resolution were calculated. Three hundred twenty-one articles were identified: 286 failed inclusion criteria (i.e., non-English, B-RYGB unrelated, <10 per arm, <3-year follow-up), leaving 35 articles. Manual review added 10 potentially relevant articles; 30 that failed inclusion criteria were excluded, leaving 15 for analysis. B-RYGB was performed on 8,707 patients: 79.0% female, mean age 38.7, and BMI 47.6 (41.0-59.4). Overall BMI weighted mean difference (reduction) at 5 years was 17.8 (95% CI 12.8, 22.7; pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Five-year weighted mean EWL of 72.5% (67.5, 77.4) was sustained at 10+ years (69.4%; 58.9, 80.0). Weighted mean complication rates were as follows: early, 10.9%, and late, 20.0%. Non-band-related reoperation rate was 15.2%, and band-specific reoperation rate was 4.1%. Gastric outlet stenosis, band erosion, and band slippage were 2.8, 2.3, and 1.5%, respectively. Diabetes remitted in 80/95 (84.2%). By systematic review and meta-analysis, albeit with limited rates of follow-up, B-RYGB appeared to result in significant, sustained excess weight loss of approximately 70.0% out to 10 years.",10.1007/s11695-014-1311-1,,,,69
36,Impact of metabolic bariatric surgery on outcomes and the 10-year risk of major adverse cardiovascular events during a 7-year period: a retrospective cohort study.,"Metabolic bariatric surgery offers enduring weight reduction and alleviation of obesity-related comorbidities, including dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Long-term data on one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) and single-anastomosis duodenal-jejunal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADJB-SG) is lacking, necessitating this investigation. In this multicenter prospectively-collected retrospective observational study, 830 adult Taiwanese patients (682 OAGB, 148 SADJB-SG) who underwent surgery from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2017, were initially identified. Following protocol, 224 patients (177 OAGB, 47 SADJB-SG) with complete follow-up data at various intervals up to 3 years after surgery were included in the final analysis. The study's primary focus is to evaluate the long-term safety, efficacy, and durability of OAGB and SADJB-SG in promoting weight loss and diabetes remission. Additionally, changes in 10-year and lifetime risks of MACE before and 3-year after surgery are assessed using Taiwan MACE risk prediction model and the China-PAR project model. SADJB-SG patients exhibit higher diabetes prevalence, lower BMI, and more severe diabetes compared to OAGB. Both groups demonstrate significant improvements in BMI, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia three years after surgery, with the most substantial improvements occurring in the second year. The Taiwan MACE risk model reveals a significant reduction in 10-year MACE and stroke risks for both groups. The China-PAR project model indicates a synchronized reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 10-year and lifetime risk in both OAGB and SADJB-SG groups. OAGB and SADJB-SG exhibit sustained improvements in weight reduction and obesity-related comorbidities over 3 years after surgery. Notably, both procedures contribute to a substantial reduction in 10-year MACE, stroke, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risks. These findings underscore the efficacy of OAGB and SADJB-SG in the context of metabolic bariatric surgery.",10.1097/JS9.0000000000001631,,,,70
1182,A randomized clinical trial of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy for the treatment of morbid obesity in China: a 5-year outcome.,"No randomized comparative trials have presented long-term outcomes for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). The present study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of these two procedures. From January 2007 to July 2008, 64 eligible patients were randomly assigned to LSG or LRYGB. During the 5-year follow-up, we compared morbidity rate, body mass index (BMI), percent of excess weight loss (%EWL), Moorehead-Ardelt (M-A) II quality of life, and resolution or improvement rate of obesity-related comorbidities between the groups. Both groups were matched with respect to age, gender, and BMI. Slightly more major complications were observed in patients undergoing LRYGB (Pâ€‰>â€‰0.05). Weight loss was significantly better with LRYGB except during the first postoperative year. At 5 years, %EWL for LSG and LRYGB was 63.2â€‰Â±â€‰24.5 % and 76.2â€‰Â±â€‰21.7 % (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.02), respectively. No statistical difference was observed in quality of life between the groups at all intervals (Pâ€‰>â€‰0.05). At the last follow-up, most comorbidities in both groups were resolved or improved, with no difference between the groups (Pâ€‰>â€‰0.05). LRYGB and LSG are equally safe and effective in quality of life and improvement or resolution of comorbidities, and LRYGB possesses the superiority in terms of weight loss. Further studies are needed to evaluate micronutrient deficiencies of these procedures.",10.1007/s11695-014-1258-2,,,,71
828,Randomized controlled trial of uncut Roux-en-Y vs Billroth II reconstruction after distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer: Which technique is better for avoiding biliary reflux and gastritis?,"To identify which technique is better for avoiding biliary reflux and gastritis between uncut Roux-en-Y and Billroth II reconstruction. A total of 158 patients who underwent laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer at the First Hospital of Jilin University (Changchun, China) between February 2015 and February 2016 were randomized into two groups: uncut Roux-en-Y (group U) and Billroth II group (group B). Postoperative complications and relevant clinical data were compared between the two groups. According to the randomization table, each group included 79 patients. There was no significant difference in postoperative complications between groups U and B (7.6% vs 10.1%, P = 0.576). During the postoperative period, group U stomach pH values were lower than 7 and group B pH values were higher than 7. After 1 year of follow-up, group B presented a higher incidence of biliary reflux and alkaline gastritis. However, histopathology did not show a significant difference in gastritis diagnosis (P = 0.278), and the amount of residual food and gain of weight between the groups were also not significantly different. At 3 mo there was no evidence of partial recanalization of uncut staple line, but at 1 year the incidence was 13%. Compared with Billroth II reconstruction, uncut Roux-en-Y reconstruction is secure and feasible, and can effectively reduce the incidence of alkaline reflux, residual gastritis, and heartburn. Despite the incidence of recanalization, uncut Roux-en-Y should be widely applied.",10.3748/wjg.v23.i34.6350,,,,72
5,Remission and relapse of diabetes after sleeve gastrectomy and one-anastomosis gastric bypass: The Tehran Obesity Treatment Study.,"To evaluate the rates and predictors of remission and relapse of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in individuals with T2DM undergoing sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). An observational prospective study with 5â€‰years of follow-up was conducted in a total of 891 patients (82.5% female) with concomitant T2DM and obesity (body mass indexâ€‰â‰¥â€‰30.0â€‰kg/m2) undergoing SG or OAGB between March 2013 and March 2021. T2DM remission was defined as achieving a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levelâ€‰<â€‰48â€‰mmol/mol and a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levelâ€‰<7â€‰mmol/L, and being off glucose-lowering agents/insulin. T2DM relapse was defined as when FPG or HbA1c reverted to the diabetic range (â‰¥7â€‰mmol/L and â‰¥48â€‰mmol/mol, respectively), or there was a need for pharmacotherapy. After bariatric surgery, the overall T2DM remission and relapse rates were 61.4 per 1000 person-months (95% confidence interval [CI] 56.8-66.4) and 5.7 per 1000 person-months (95% CI 4.1-7.9), respectively. These rates were similar in the SG and OAGB groups. Multivariate hazard ratio analysis identified history of insulin therapy and T2DM duration prior to surgery as predictors of remission, while treatment with â‰¥2 glucose-lowering agents was the only relapse predictor. Additionally, patients undergoing SG experienced either remission or relapse within a significantly shorter time frame compared to those undergoing OAGB. After 5â€‰years of follow-up, there were no significant differences between the SG and OAGB groups with regard to T2DM remission and relapse. Bariatric surgery was less likely to result in remission in patients with a history of insulin therapy and longer durations of T2DM prior to surgery. Furthermore, patients who received â‰¥2 glucose-lowering agents, despite possible remission, were at a higher risk of experiencing late relapse.",10.1111/dom.15974,,,,73
333,"Standard versus distal Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in patients with BMI 50-60 kg/m2: 5-year outcomes of a double-blind, randomized clinical trial.","The optimal surgical weight loss procedure for patients with a BMI of 50â€‰kg/m2 or more is uncertain. This study compared distal Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) with standard RYGB. In this double-blind RCT, patients aged 18-60â€‰years with a BMI of 50-60â€‰kg/m2 were allocated randomly to receive standard (150â€‰cm alimentary, 50â€‰cm biliopancreatic limb) or distal (150â€‰cm common channel, 50â€‰cm biliopancreatic limb) RYGB. The primary outcome (change in BMI at 2â€‰years) has been reported previously. Secondary outcomes 5â€‰years after surgery, such as weight loss, health-related quality of life, and nutritional outcomes are reported. Between May 2011 and April 2013, 123 patients were randomized, 113 received an intervention, and 92 attended 5-year follow-up. Mean age was 40 (95 per cent c.i. 38 to 41) years and 73 patients (65 per cent) were women; 57 underwent standard RYGB and 56 distal RYGB. BMI was reduced by 15.1 (95 per cent c.i. 13.9 to 16.2)â€‰kg/m2 after standard and 15.7 (14.5 to 16.9)â€‰kg/m2 after distal RYGB; the between-group difference was -0.64 (-2.3 to 1.0) kg/m2 (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.447). Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and haemoglobin A1c levels declined more after distal than after standard RYGB. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased more after standard RYGB. Vitamin A and vitamin D levels were lower after distal RYGB. Changes in bone mineral density, resting metabolic rate, and total energy intake were comparable. Distal RYGB did not enable greater weight loss than standard RYGB. Differences in other outcomes favouring distal RYGB may not justify routine use of this procedure in patients with a BMI of 50-60â€‰kg/m2.

247,Length of biliopancreatic limb in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and its impact on post-operative outcomes in metabolic and obesity surgery-systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is a gold-standard procedure for treatment of obesity and associated comorbidities. No consensus on the optimal design of this operation has been achieved, with various lengths of bypassed small bowel limb lengths being used by bariatric surgeons. This aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine whether biliopancreatic limb (BPL) length in RYGB affects postoperative outcomes including superior reduction in weight, body mass index (BMI), and resolution of metabolic comorbidities associated with obesity. A systematic search of the literature was conducted up until 1st June 2021. Meta-analysis of primary outcomes was performed utilising a random-effects model. Statistical significance was determined by p valueâ€‰<â€‰0.05. Ten randomised controlled trials were included in the final quantitative analysis. No difference in outcomes following short versus long BLP in RYGB was identified at 12-72 months post-operatively, namely in BMI reduction, remission or improvement of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and complications (pâ€‰>â€‰0.05). Even though results of four studies showed superior total body weight loss in the long BPL cohorts at 24 months post-operatively (pooled mean difference -6.92, 95% CI -12.37, -1.48, pâ€‰=â€‰0.01), this outcome was not observed at any other timepoint. Based on the outcomes of the present study, there is no definitive evidence to suggest that alteration of the BPL affects the quantity of weight loss or resolution of co-existent metabolic comorbidities associated with obesity.",10.1038/s41366-022-01186-0,,,,75
573,"Single-Anastomosis Sleeve Jejunal Bypass, a Novel Bariatric Surgery, Versus Other Familiar Methods: Results of a 6-Month Follow-up-a Comparative Study.","Obesity and its associated morbidities have become a significant concern all over the world. Bariatric surgery, regardless of its type, is the most effective approach for treating morbid obesity. Single-anastomosis sleeve jejunal (SASJ) bypass is a novel bariatric surgery technique and can be considered for patients with former background of severe gastroesophageal symptoms. The purpose of this research was to compare SASJ bypass outcomes with other techniques during a 6-month follow-up. This is a non-randomized clinical trial conducted on 100 patients, who underwent four types of bariatric surgery (classic Roux-en-Y bypass, SASJ bypass, omega gastric bypass, and sleeve gastrectomy), and each one of these types contained 25 cases, during the time period of 2 years from 2016 to 2018. Patients' information including age, gender, height, basal weight, body mass index (BMI), serum albumin, and hemoglobin A1C were recorded, within 1, 3, and 6 months after their surgery, and also were compared with each other. Members of the four groups were similar due to their age, gender distribution, height, baseline BMI, hemoglobin A1C, albumin, and also excess weight (P value > 0.05); however, the sleeve gastrectomy group baseline weight was significantly higher compared with the other three groups (P value = 0.013). All of the groups significantly lost weight during this 6-month period, but the comparison between them indicated no statistical difference regarding excess weight loss, BMI, hemoglobin A1C, and albumin (P value > 0.05). The excess weight loss mean during 6 months in SASJ bypass was 34.2 Â± 5.4%, which was comparable with other groups. The weight loss trend after the SASJ bypass was similar to that of older techniques; consequently this technique can be considered for cases with particular indications due to the reversibility and also more accessible gastric follow-up studies in the SASJ approach. Further researches with longer follow-ups are strongly recommended.",10.1007/s11695-019-04266-9,,,,76
1323,Bariatric surgery versus intensive medical therapy in obese patients with diabetes.,"Observational studies have shown improvement in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after bariatric surgery. In this randomized, nonblinded, single-center trial, we evaluated the efficacy of intensive medical therapy alone versus medical therapy plus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy in 150 obese patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. The mean (Â±SD) age of the patients was 49Â±8 years, and 66% were women. The average glycated hemoglobin level was 9.2Â±1.5%. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.0% or less 12 months after treatment. Of the 150 patients, 93% completed 12 months of follow-up. The proportion of patients with the primary end point was 12% (5 of 41 patients) in the medical-therapy group versus 42% (21 of 50 patients) in the gastric-bypass group (P=0.002) and 37% (18 of 49 patients) in the sleeve-gastrectomy group (P=0.008). Glycemic control improved in all three groups, with a mean glycated hemoglobin level of 7.5Â±1.8% in the medical-therapy group, 6.4Â±0.9% in the gastric-bypass group (P<0.001), and 6.6Â±1.0% in the sleeve-gastrectomy group (P=0.003). Weight loss was greater in the gastric-bypass group and sleeve-gastrectomy group (-29.4Â±9.0 kg and -25.1Â±8.5 kg, respectively) than in the medical-therapy group (-5.4Â±8.0 kg) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The use of drugs to lower glucose, lipid, and blood-pressure levels decreased significantly after both surgical procedures but increased in patients receiving medical therapy only. The index for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) improved significantly after bariatric surgery. Four patients underwent reoperation. There were no deaths or life-threatening complications. In obese patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, 12 months of medical therapy plus bariatric surgery achieved glycemic control in significantly more patients than medical therapy alone. Further study will be necessary to assess the durability of these results. (Funded by Ethicon Endo-Surgery and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00432809.).",10.1056/NEJMoa1200225,,,,77
452,Revisional One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass After Restrictive Index Surgery-a Metaanalysis and Comparison with Revisional Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.,"One-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) was established as a recognized bariatric procedure in the 2018 International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders (IFSO) position statement. This study evaluates the outcomes of revisional OAGB (rOAGB) after a restrictive index procedure, and to compare it to revisional RYGB (rRYGB). A literature search was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines on papers published from inception till February 2020. Original studies involving patients who underwent rOAGB after a primary failed restrictive procedure were included. The primary outcome measured was postrOAGB weight loss. Secondary outcome measures include comorbidity resolution, operative duration, length of stay, morbidity, and mortality. A total of 21 studies with 1377 patients were included. Five studies compared rOAGB versus rRYGB. Majority of the patients (76%) were female, with mean age of 43.5Â years old. Mean body mass index (BMI) before revisional surgery was 41.6Â kg/m2. The most common biliopancreatic limb length was 200Â cm. Percentage of excess weight loss after rOAGB increases to a maximum of 76.0% at 48Â months postsurgery. rOAGB resulted in a pooled prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea resolution of 74.9%, 48.4%, 63.2%, and 75.7% respectively. When compared to rRYGB, rOAGB demonstrated greater weight loss, comparable metabolic syndrome resolution, but with a shorter operating time. Morbidity and mortality rates were low across all studies. rOAGB has potential as an alternative revisional surgery, with weight loss profiles and rates of metabolic syndrome resolution that are comparable to rRYGB.",10.1007/s11695-020-05094-y,,,,78
802,MINI-GASTRIC BYPASS: DESCRIPTION OF THE TECHNIQUE AND PRELIMINARY RESULTS.,"In recent years, a surgical technique known as single-anastomosis gastric bypass or mini-gastric bypass has been developed. Its frequency of performance has increased considerably in the current decade. To describe the mini-gastric bypass technique, its implementation and preliminary results in a university hospital. This is an ongoing prospective trial to evaluate the long-term effects of mini-gastric bypass. The main features of the operation were: a gastric pouch with about 15-18 cm (50-150 ml) with a gastroenteric anastomosis in the pre-colic isoperistaltic loop 200 cm from the duodenojejunal angle (biliopancreatic loop). Seventeen individuals have undergone surgery. No procedure needed to be converted to open approach. The overall 30-day morbidity was 5.9% (one individual had intestinal obstruction caused by adhesions). There was no mortality. Mini-gastric bypass is a feasible and safe bariatric surgical procedure.",10.1590/0102-6720201700040009,,,,79
1142,Effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with different pouch size in Chinese T2DM patients with BMI 30-35 kg/m2.,"The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) with different pouch size in Chinese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with measured body mass index (BMI) 30-35 kg/m(2). In this randomized and prospective study, we evaluated the efficacy of RYGB with smaller size pouch (10-20 ml) versus larger pouch size (25-35 ml) in 76 Chinese obese patients (33 F, 43 M) with T2DM. According to protocol, all patients were divided into two groups, smaller pouch size group and larger pouch size group, and underwent RYGB surgery. Primary inclusion criteria of study were (a) a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin level >7.0 %), (b) measured BMI of at least 30 kg/m(2) and not yet 35 kg/m(2), and (c) age between 25 and 60 years old, and (d) patients were excluded if they had previously undergone complex abdominal surgery or bariatric surgery. Weight loss, BMI, percentage of excess weight loss (% EWL), glycated hemoglobin, and fasting plasma glucose were obtained at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after surgery. Of these 76 patients, 69 (91 %) patients completed follow-up postoperative 12 months. Weight loss and % EWL at 12 months was greater in smaller pouch size group (mean 15.8 kg, 95 % CI -17.2 to -14.4 and mean 68.9, 95 % CI 62.5-75.2 %) than in larger pouch size group (mean -13.7 kg, 95 % CI -15.3 to -12.1, and mean 59.1, 95 % CI 52.8-65.5) (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.046, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.033, respectively). Glycemic control improved in both two groups, with a mean glycated hemoglobin level of 6.2 % (95 % CI 6.0-6.5 %) in smaller size group, and 6.7 % (95 % CI 6.4-7.0 %) in larger size group (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.025, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). The fasting plasma glucose level decreased significantly after surgery, with a mean level of 5.4 mmol/L (95 % CI 5.2-5.5 mmol/L) and 5.6 mmol/L (95 % CI 5.5-5.8 mmol/L) respectively, (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.040, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). In this short-term study, in Chinese T2DM patients with BMI 30-35 kg/m(2), we observed a greater efficiency on weight loss and glycemic control with smaller pouch size compared to larger pouch size. In the future, long-term follow-up and large sample study will be necessary to confirm these outcomes.",10.1007/s11695-014-1411-y,,,,80
72,Prospective evaluation of transoral outlet reduction (TORe) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) failure.,"Weight regain after RYGB is multifactorial including dilatation of the gastro-jejunal anastomosis. Transoral outlet reduction (TORe) procedure is a minimally invasive alternative to surgical anastomotic revision. We conducted a prospective, multicenter, simple blind, randomized study in patients with weight regain following RYGB, comparing the efficacy of conventional nutritional and behavioral management associated with a TORe procedure (TORe group) with conventional management alone and a Sham procedure (Sham group). The main objective of this study was to evaluate the percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) at 12Â months after endoscopy. From January 2015 to January 2019, 73 subjects were randomized in four French Bariatric centers. The final analysis involved 50 subjects, 25 in each group, 44 women, 6 men, with an average BMI of 40.6Â kg/m2. At 12Â months, the average %EWL was significantly higher in the TORe group than in the Sham group (13.5â€‰Â±â€‰14.1 vs.â€‰-â€‰0.77â€‰Â±â€‰17.1; pâ€‰=â€‰0.002). Cohen's d was 0.91, indicating a large effect size of the procedure on the %EWL. There was no significant difference between groups concerning the improvement of obesity-related comorbidities (diabetes and dyslipidemia) and quality of life at 12Â months. We report frequent adverse events in the TORe group (20% had adverse events related to the procedure). Three adverse events were serious, including two perforations of the gastro-jejunal anastomosis after TORe group that led to the premature termination of the study. After RYGBP failure linked to the dilatation of the gastro-jejunal anastomosis, TORe procedure with nutritional management results in significantly higher %EWL at 12Â months compared to patients with nutritional management alone. As surgery, this minimally invasive endoscopic procedure can be associated with severe adverse events.",10.1007/s00464-023-10650-5,,,,81
1042,"A Comparative, Prospective and Randomized Evaluation of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass With and Without the Silastic Ring: A 2-Year Follow Up Preliminary Report on Weight Loss and Quality of Life.","Currently, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the most widely used bariatric surgeries. Banding the pouch forms a banded gastric bypass operation, an accepted and frequently used variant. Placing a silastic ring around the pouch to band the gastric bypass operation increases the restriction mechanism. However, the ubiquitous use of the banded gastric bypass remains controversial. One of the controversies is the effect of the silastic ring on patients' perception of their well being after surgery because of the frequency of vomiting. A prospective, blindly randomized, comparative trial was undertaken to resolve this controversy. Four hundred subjects scheduled for gastric bypass surgery were randomized into two arms of the trial, 200 with a silastic ring (WR) and 200 without (NR). After 2-year follow-up, the variables associated with the scores of Bariatric Analysis and Reporting Outcome System (BAROS) were analyzed. The initial median weight (125 kg), BMI (47), and age (36 years) were the same in both the NR and WR groups. The median excess weight loss, weight regain, and incidence of vomiting were 71, 10.5, and 7.75%, respectively, in the NR group vs. 75.4 and 1.1, and 24.4% in the WR group. The mean QOL score was 79% in the NR group vs. 80% in the WR group. After 2-year follow-up, silastic ring placement in the RYGB resulted in greater weight loss and weight stability and a threefold greater incidence of vomiting. There was no difference in the scores in the quality of life analysis.",10.1007/s11695-015-1851-z,,,,82
283,Treatment Options for Weight Regain or Insufficient Weight Loss After Sleeve Gastrectomy: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Weight failure after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is frequently observed. Consensus on the most effective treatment is lacking. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess revisional strategies for weight regain (WR) or insufficient weight loss (IWL) following SG. The included studies reported on endoscopic gastroplasty (ESG), re-sleeve gastrectomy (re-SG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB), single-anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass (SADI), and duodenal switch (DS). All techniques resulted in clinically relevant weight loss. Although our data suggest that revisional OAGB was the most effective procedure, the lack of direct comparisons precludes strong conclusions. All procedures were feasible but differed regarding complication rates. Choice of procedure is depending on patient's characteristics and surgeons' expertise.",10.1007/s11695-022-06020-0,,,,83
1102,Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus sleeve gastrectomy for obese patients with Type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus sleeve gastrectomy for obese patients with Type 2 diabetes. We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and the Chinese Wan fang database up to October 2013. Randomized controlled trials regarding the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic gastric bypass versus sleeve gastrectomy for obese diabetic patients were included. Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias. The mean difference and relative risk were estimated with 95 per cent confidence intervals. Four randomized controlled trials met inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference between gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy groups with regard to glycosylated hemoglobin (mean difference [MD], 0.41%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.09 to 0.91), fasting plasma glucose (standardized MD, 0.61 mg/mL; 95% CI, -0.10 to 1.32), the numbers of subjects using oral antihyperglycemic medications and insulin (relative rate [RR], 1.53; 95% CI, 0.45 to 5.24; RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 0.47 to 4.39, respectively), body weight (MD, 0.42 kg; 95% CI, -5.01 to 5.85), body mass index (MD, 0.85 kg/m(2); 95% CI, 0.13 to 1.58), or waist circumference (MD, 1.59 cm; 95% CI, -3.02 to 6.19). However, cardiovascular risk was more significantly lessened in the gastric bypass group. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that compared with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass offers equal efficacy for treatment of diabetes in obese patients but is associated with a significantly decreased cardiovascular risk.",,,,,84
18,Efficiency and safety of single anastomosis sleeve ileal (SASI) bypass in the treatment of obesity and associated comorbidities: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The Single Anastomosis Sleeve Ileal (SASI) bypass is a new bariatric surgery corresponding to an adaptation of the Santoro approach, consisting of a sleeve gastrectomy (SG) followed by loop gastroileostomy. Therefore, we aimed to systematically assess all the current literature on SASI bypass in terms of safety, weight loss, improvement in associated comorbidities, and complications. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis by searching three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science). We performed a meta-analysis of risk ratios and mean differences to compare surgical approaches for excessive weight loss, improvement/remission in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension (HT), dyslipidemia (DL), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and complications. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. Eighteen studies were included in the qualitative analysis and four in the quantitative analysis, comparing SASI bypass with SG and One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB). A comparison between Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) and SASI bypass could not be performed. Compared to SG, the SASI bypass was associated with improved weight loss (MDâ€‰=â€‰11.32; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) [7.89;14.76]; pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001), and improvement or remission in T2DM (RRâ€‰=â€‰1.35; 95%CI [1.07;1.69]; pâ€‰=â€‰0.011), DL (RRâ€‰=â€‰1.41; 95%CI [1.00;1.99]; pâ€‰=â€‰0.048) and OSA (RRâ€‰=â€‰1.50; 95%CI [1.01;2.22]; pâ€‰=â€‰0.042). No statistically significant differences in any of the assessed outcomes were observed when compared with OAGB. When compared to both SG and OAGB, the complication rate of SASI was similar. Although studies with longer follow-up periods are needed, this systematic review and meta-analysis showed that SASI bypass has a significant effect on weight loss and metabolic variables. Variations in outcomes between studies reinforce the need for standardization.",10.1007/s00423-024-03413-w,,,,85
1527,Is there a benefit to preoperative weight loss in gastric bypass patients? A prospective randomized trial.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery is the leading surgical treatment of morbid obesity in the United States. The role of preoperative weight loss in gastric bypass surgery remains controversial. We performed a prospective randomized trial to determine whether preoperative weight loss results in better outcomes after laparoscopic gastric bypass. A total of 100 patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery from May 2004 to October 2005 were randomized preoperatively to either a weight loss group with a 10% weight loss requirement or a group that had no weight loss requirements. The patients were followed prospectively. The variables analyzed included perioperative complications, operative time, postoperative weight loss, and resolution of co-morbidities. Data were available for 26 patients in the weight loss group and 35 in the nonweight loss group. The 2 groups had similar preoperative characteristics, conversion and complication rates, and resolution of co-morbidities. The initial body mass index was 48.7 kg/m(2) and 49.3 kg/m(2) for the weight loss group and nonweight loss group, respectively (P = NS). The preoperative body mass index was 44.5 kg/m(2) and 50.7 kg/m(2) for the weight loss group and nonweight loss group, respectively (P = 0.0027). The operative time was 220.2 and 257.6 minutes for the 2 groups (P = 0.0084). The percentage of excess weight loss at 3 and 6 months for the weight loss group and nonweight loss group was 44.1% and 33.1% (P = 0.0267) and 53.9% and 50.9% (P = NS), respectively. The interval to surgery from the initial consultation was 5.4 months and 5.2 months for the 2 groups (P = NS). Preoperative weight loss before laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was associated with a decrease in the operating room time and an improved percentage of excess weight loss in the short term. Preoperative weight loss, however, did not affect the major complication or conversion rates, and its long-term effects were not apparent through this study. Also, preoperative weight loss did not have any bearing on the resolution of co-morbidities.",10.1016/j.soard.2006.11.006,,,,86
1288,Evolution of glycolipid profile after sleeve gastrectomy vs. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: results of a prospective randomized clinical trial.,"This study aims to report glycolipid changes after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in the setting of a prospective randomized clinical trial. One hundred patients were randomly assigned to RYGB (n = 45) and SG (n = 55). Fasting glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c%), triglycerides, and serum cholesterol (total, HDL, and LDL) were evaluated at inclusion and after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The index for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and Î² cell function (HOMA-B) were assessed. Mean postoperative 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month excess weight loss was 25.39, 43.47, 63.75, and 80.38 % after RYGB and 25.25, 51.32, 64.67, and 82.97 % after SG, respectively. Mean fasting glucose and fasting serum insulin were similarly and statistically significantly reduced in both RYGB and SG. Mean HOMA-IR improved in both groups, particularly in case of high preoperative values, and mean HOMA-B improved at 1 year after RYGB. HbA1c% dropped from 5.66 % (SD = 0.61) to 5.57 % (SD = 0.32) after RYGB and from 5.64 % (SD = 0.43) to 5.44 % (SD = 0.43) after SG. Total cholesterol was significantly higher at 1 month (p = 0.04), 3 months (p = 0.03), and 1 year (p = 0.005) after SG as compared to RYGB. LDL cholesterol decreased significantly after RYGB at 1 month (p = 0.03), 3 months (p = 0.0001), and 1 year (p = 0.0004) as compared to SG. HDL cholesterol was increased at 1 year in the RYGB group but not in the SG group. Triglycerides decreased similarly in both groups. Short-term glycemic control was comparable after SG and RYGB. An improved lipid profile was noted after RYGB in patients with abnormal preoperative values.",10.1007/s11695-012-0827-5,,,,87
1616,"The effect of Roux limb lengths on outcome after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a prospective, randomized clinical trial.","The effect of limb-length on weight loss after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) is controversial; hence, the optimal limb-lengths have not been determined. This study evaluated the effect of different limb-lengths on weight loss after RYGBP. The study was a prospective randomized clinical trial in which patients undergoing RYGBP (110 F, 24 M; mean age 39.7) were randomized as follows: BMI < or = 50 (N = 69): A-75 cm (N = 35) vs B-150 cm alimentary limb (N = 34) and C-150 cm (N = 33) vs D-250 cm alimentary limb (N = 31). All other aspects of the operation were identical. Patients were followed at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months and yearly thereafter. There were no significant differences in age, sex, race, initial BMI, or excess weight between patients assigned to groups A vs B and C vs D. Postoperative nutritional intake was also similar between groups. Within each weight category, there were no differences in mean weight loss, change in BMI, and % excess weight lost (EWL) over time. When the number of patients achieving 50% EWL was evaluated, there was no difference between groups with a BMI < or = 50 kg/m2; however, among patients with a BMI > 50 kg/m2, a significantly greater percentage of those having a 250-cm limb achieved > 50% EWL at 18 months postoperatively. This difference was lost at 24 and 36 months, possibly due to the small sample size. In patients with a BMI < or = 50, there appears to be no advantage to longer limb-lengths. In patients with BMI > 50, however, these data suggest that longer alimentary limb-lengths may be associated with a higher percent of patients achieving > 50% EWL. Longer follow-up studies of the effects of limb-length on success of RYGBP are indicated.",10.1381/096089202762252316,,,,88
834,Weight and Metabolic Outcomes 12 Years after Gastric Bypass.,"Few long-term or controlled studies of bariatric surgery have been conducted to date. We report the 12-year follow-up results of an observational, prospective study of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass that was conducted in the United States. A total of 1156 patients with severe obesity comprised three groups: 418 patients who sought and underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (surgery group), 417 patients who sought but did not undergo surgery (primarily for insurance reasons) (nonsurgery group 1), and 321 patients who did not seek surgery (nonsurgery group 2). We performed clinical examinations at baseline and at 2 years, 6 years, and 12 years to ascertain the presence of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The follow-up rate exceeded 90% at 12 years. The adjusted mean change from baseline in body weight in the surgery group was -45.0 kg (95% confidence interval [CI], -47.2 to -42.9; mean percent change, -35.0) at 2 years, -36.3 kg (95% CI, -39.0 to -33.5; mean percent change, -28.0) at 6 years, and -35.0 kg (95% CI, -38.4 to -31.7; mean percent change, -26.9) at 12 years; the mean change at 12 years in nonsurgery group 1 was -2.9 kg (95% CI, -6.9 to 1.0; mean percent change, -2.0), and the mean change at 12 years in nonsurgery group 2 was 0 kg (95% CI, -3.5 to 3.5; mean percent change, -0.9). Among the patients in the surgery group who had type 2 diabetes at baseline, type 2 diabetes remitted in 66 of 88 patients (75%) at 2 years, in 54 of 87 patients (62%) at 6 years, and in 43 of 84 patients (51%) at 12 years. The odds ratio for the incidence of type 2 diabetes at 12 years was 0.08 (95% CI, 0.03 to 0.24) for the surgery group versus nonsurgery group 1 and 0.09 (95% CI, 0.03 to 0.29) for the surgery group versus nonsurgery group 2 (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The surgery group had higher remission rates and lower incidence rates of hypertension and dyslipidemia than did nonsurgery group 1 (P<0.05 for all comparisons). This study showed long-term durability of weight loss and effective remission and prevention of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

1133,The long-term effects of bariatric surgery for type 2 diabetes: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and non-randomized evidence.,"This study aims to assess the long-term effects of bariatric surgery on type 2 diabetic patients. We searched Cochrane Library, PubMed, and EMbase up to Dec 2013. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies of bariatric surgery for diabetes patients that reported data with more than 2 years of follow-up were included. We used rigorous methods to screen studies for eligibility and collected data using standardized forms. Where applicable, we pooled data by meta-analyses. Twenty-six studies, including 2 RCTs and 24 cohort studies that enrolled 7883 patients, proved eligible. Despite the differences in the design, those studies consistently showed that bariatric surgery offered better treatment outcomes than non-surgical options. Pooling of cohort studies showed that BMI decreased by 13.4 kg/m(2) (95 % confidence interval (CI), -17.7 to -9.1), fasting blood glucose by 59.7 mg/dl (95 % CI, -74.6 to -44.9), and glycated hemoglobin by 1.8 % (95 % CI, -2.4 to -1.3). Diabetes was improved or in remission in 89.2 % of patients, and 64.7 % of patients was in remission. Weight loss and diabetes remission were greatest in patients undergoing biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal switch, followed by gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and adjustable gastric banding. Bariatric surgery may achieve sustained weight loss, glucose control, and diabetes remission. Large randomized trials with long-term follow-up are warranted to demonstrate the effect on outcomes important to patients (e.g., cardiovascular events).",10.1007/s11695-014-1460-2,,,,90
737,Banded vs. non-banded Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"We aim to review the available literature on patients with morbid obesity treated with banded (BRYGB) or non-banded Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (NBRYGB), in order to compare the clinical outcomes and intraoperative parameters of the two methods. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane library and Scopus databases, in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria incorporating 3899 patients. This study reveals similar rates of complications, mortality, remission of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, gastroesophageal reflux and obstructive sleep apnoea, along with similar % excess weight loss (%EWL) at 1 and 2 years postoperatively. In contrast, according to an analysis of two eligible studies the BRYGB procedure was associated with increased %EWL at 5 years postoperatively. These results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of statistical arms and randomized controlled studies. However, the present article represents the best available evidence in the field. Well-designed, randomized controlled studies, comparing BRYGB to NBRYGB, are necessary to further assess their clinical outcomes.",10.1111/cob.12274,,,,91
115,"[Analysis of the 1-year curative efficacy of sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, single anastomosis duodenal-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch in patients with super obesity].","Objective: To evaluate the 1-year postoperative efficacy of four bariatric procedures, namely sleeve gastrectomy (SG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), single anastomosis duodenal-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S), and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD/DS) for treating super obesity. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, we analyzed the clinical data of 40 patients with super obesity (body mass index [BMI]â‰¥50 kg/m2) who had undergone bariatric surgery in the China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University from November 2015 to December 2020. The study cohort consisted of 21 men and 19 women of average age 31.7Â±9.0 years. The preoperative weight and BMI were (159.2Â±16.9) kg and (53.4Â±3.0) kg/m2, respectively. Prior to the surgery, 30 individuals had hypertension, 27 hyperuricemia, 15 type 2 diabetes, 10 abnormally high total cholesterol, 20 abnormally high triglycerides, and 24 abnormally high low-density lipoprotein. We divided the participants into four groups according to the type of operation: SG group (n=16), RYGB group (n=9), SADI-S group (n=9) and BPD/DS group (n=6). We examined the following factors: weight, BMI, excess weight loss (%), total weight loss (%), and remission of preoperative metabolic diseases (including hypertension, hyperuricemia, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia) 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. The variables assessed for hypertension were systolic and diastolic blood pressure; for type 2 diabetes, glycated hemoglobin; and for hyperlipidemia, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein 1-year after the surgery. The safety of surgery was also assessed. Results: All patients successfully completed laparoscopic procedures, none of them requiring conversion to laparotomy. The amount of blood loss during surgery was less than 50 mL. Postoperative hospital stay was 6-16 days. There were no deaths during the perioperative period. However, two postoperative complications occurred in the RYGB group, namely bleeding and anastomotic leakage. No complications were detected in the other groups. At 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery, percentage of excess weight loss was 36.6Â±11.0, 62.4Â±15.7, and 68.2Â±16.0 (F=21.830, P<0.001) in the SG group; 30.6Â±6.9, 42.5Â±5.8, and 50.6Â±11.1 (F=13.222, P<0.001) in the RYGB group; 39.7Â±7.8, 54.6Â±12.7, and 81.9Â±12.0 (F=33.821, P<0.001) in the SADI-S group; and 40.2Â±4.8, 57.7Â±11.8, and 82.8Â±14.9 (F=21.552, P<0.001), respectively, in the BPD/DS group. The percentage of excess weight loss increased significantly over the 12-month observation period in all groups . Compared with before surgery, hypertension and hyperuricemia in the SG, SADI-S, and BPD-DS groups showed significant improvement after one year (all P<0.05). However, only the SADI-S group exhibited a significant decrease in glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations (P=0.038). Only the BPD-DS group showed significant decreases in various indicators of hyperlipidemia (all P<0.05). The improvements in obesity-related complication indexes did not reach statistical significance in the RYGB group (all P>0.05). Conclusion: SG, RYGB, SADI-S and BPD/DS are all safe and effective treatments for super obesity. All of these procedures can improve the associated metabolic diseases to a certain extent.",10.3760/cma.j.cn441530-20221025-00431,,,,92
1189,Bariatric surgery versus intensive medical therapy for diabetes--3-year outcomes.,"In short-term randomized trials (duration, 1 to 2 years), bariatric surgery has been associated with improvement in type 2 diabetes mellitus. We assessed outcomes 3 years after the randomization of 150 obese patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes to receive either intensive medical therapy alone or intensive medical therapy plus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. The primary end point was a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.0% or less. The mean (Â±SD) age of the patients at baseline was 48Â±8 years, 68% were women, the mean baseline glycated hemoglobin level was 9.3Â±1.5%, and the mean baseline body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 36.0Â±3.5. A total of 91% of the patients completed 36 months of follow-up. At 3 years, the criterion for the primary end point was met by 5% of the patients in the medical-therapy group, as compared with 38% of those in the gastric-bypass group (P<0.001) and 24% of those in the sleeve-gastrectomy group (P=0.01). The use of glucose-lowering medications, including insulin, was lower in the surgical groups than in the medical-therapy group. Patients in the surgical groups had greater mean percentage reductions in weight from baseline, with reductions of 24.5Â±9.1% in the gastric-bypass group and 21.1Â±8.9% in the sleeve-gastrectomy group, as compared with a reduction of 4.2Â±8.3% in the medical-therapy group (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Quality-of-life measures were significantly better in the two surgical groups than in the medical-therapy group. There were no major late surgical complications. Among obese patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, 3 years of intensive medical therapy plus bariatric surgery resulted in glycemic control in significantly more patients than did medical therapy alone. Analyses of secondary end points, including body weight, use of glucose-lowering medications, and quality of life, also showed favorable results at 3 years in the surgical groups, as compared with the group receiving medical therapy alone.

494,Metabolic outcomes after revisional bariatric surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"It has been well-established that primary bariatric surgery is effective in inducing improvement of diabetes and other associated co-morbidities in patients with obesity. Evidence demonstrating the influence of revisional bariatric surgery on this trajectory, however, is lacking. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the impact of revisional bariatric surgery on obesity-related metabolic outcomes. University Hospital, Singapore METHODS: We examined outcomes of remission and improvement of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea. Revisional surgeries included sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, pouch revision, duodenal switch, and minigastric bypass. Our search identified 33 relevant studies including a total of 1593 patients. Meta-analysis of proportions demonstrated a 92% improvement in diabetes with 50% achieving remission after revisional bariatric surgery. Of patients, 81% achieved improvement of hypertension with 33% achieving complete remission. In both groups, the highest proportion of improvement was observed after revisional duodenal switch. Although reported by fewer studies, a remission of hyperlipidemia was reported in 37% of patients and improvement of obstructive sleep apnea was seen in 86% of patients. Revisional bariatric surgery improves the outcomes of obesity-related co-morbidities and should be considered in patients with persistent metabolic disease after primary bariatric surgery.",10.1016/j.soard.2020.05.029,,,,94
1171,Efficacy and safety of laparoscopic mini gastric bypass. A systematic review.,"Laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass (LMGB) is a relatively new bariatric procedure; published studies are accumulating in various settings. The objective of this study was to summarize the available evidence about the efficacy and safety of LMGB. A systematic search in the literature was performed , and PubMed and reference lists were scrutinized (end-of-search date: July 15, 2013). For the assessment of the eligible articles, the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale was used. Ten eligible studies were included in this study, reporting data on 4,899 patients. According to all included studies, LMGB induced substantial weight and body mass index reduction, as well as substantial excess weight loss. Moreover, resolution or improvement in all major associated medical illnesses and improvement in overall Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index score were recorded. Major bleeding and anastomotic ulcer were the most commonly reported complications. Readmission rate ranged from 0%- 11%, whereas the rate of revision operations ranged from .3%- 6%. The latter were conducted due to a variety of medical reasons such as inadequate or excessive weight loss, malnutrition, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Finally, the mortality rate ranged between 0% and .5% among primary LMGB procedures. LMGB represents an effective bariatric procedure; its safety and minimal postoperative morbidity seem remarkable. Randomized comparative studies seem mandatory for the further evaluation of LMGB.",10.1016/j.soard.2014.02.009,,,,95
1562,Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y versus mini-gastric bypass for the treatment of morbid obesity: a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial.,"This prospective, randomized trial compared the safety and effectiveness of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP) and laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass (LMGBP) in the treatment of morbid obesity. LRYGBP has been the gold standard for the treatment of morbid obesity. While LMGBP has been reported to be a simple and effective treatment, data from a randomized trial are lacking. Eighty patients who met the NIH criteria were recruited and randomized to receive either LRYGBP (n = 40) or LMGBP (n = 40). The minimum postoperative follow-up was 2 years (mean, 31.3 months). Perioperative data were assessed. Late complication, excess weight loss, BMI, quality of life, and comorbidities were determined. Changes in quality of life were assessed using the Gastro-Intestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI). There was one conversion (2.5%) in the LRYGBP group. Operation time was shorter in LMGBP group (205 versus 148, P < 0.05). There was no mortality in each group. The operative morbidity rate was higher in the LRYGBP group (20% versus 7.5%, P < 0.05). The late complications rate was the same in the 2 groups (7.5%) with no reoperation. The percentage of excess weight loss was 58.7% and 60.0% at 1 and 2 years, respectively, in the LPYGBP group, and 64.9% and 64.4% in the LMGBP group. The residual excess weight <50% at 2 years postoperatively was achieved in 75% of patients in the LRYGBP group and 95% in the LMGBP group (P < 0.05). A significant improvement of obesity-related clinical parameters and complete resolution of metabolic syndrome in both groups were noted. Both gastrointestinal quality of life increased significantly without any significant difference between the groups. Both LRYGBP and LMGBP are effective for morbid obesity with similar results for resolution of metabolic syndrome and improvement of quality of life. LMGBP is a simpler and safer procedure that has no disadvantage compared with LRYGBP at 2 years of follow-up.",10.1097/01.sla.0000167762.46568.98,,,,96
902,Bariatric Surgery versus Intensive Medical Therapy for Diabetes - 5-Year Outcomes.,"Long-term results from randomized, controlled trials that compare medical therapy with surgical therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes are limited. We assessed outcomes 5 years after 150 patients who had type 2 diabetes and a body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 27 to 43 were randomly assigned to receive intensive medical therapy alone or intensive medical therapy plus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. The primary outcome was a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.0% or less with or without the use of diabetes medications. Of the 150 patients who underwent randomization, 1 patient died during the 5-year follow-up period; 134 of the remaining 149 patients (90%) completed 5 years of follow-up. At baseline, the mean (Â±SD) age of the 134 patients was 49Â±8 years, 66% were women, the mean glycated hemoglobin level was 9.2Â±1.5%, and the mean BMI was 37Â±3.5. At 5 years, the criterion for the primary end point was met by 2 of 38 patients (5%) who received medical therapy alone, as compared with 14 of 49 patients (29%) who underwent gastric bypass (unadjusted P=0.01, adjusted P=0.03, P=0.08 in the intention-to-treat analysis) and 11 of 47 patients (23%) who underwent sleeve gastrectomy (unadjusted P=0.03, adjusted P=0.07, P=0.17 in the intention-to-treat analysis). Patients who underwent surgical procedures had a greater mean percentage reduction from baseline in glycated hemoglobin level than did patients who received medical therapy alone (2.1% vs. 0.3%, P=0.003). At 5 years, changes from baseline observed in the gastric-bypass and sleeve-gastrectomy groups were superior to the changes seen in the medical-therapy group with respect to body weight (-23%, -19%, and -5% in the gastric-bypass, sleeve-gastrectomy, and medical-therapy groups, respectively), triglyceride level (-40%, -29%, and -8%), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (32%, 30%, and 7%), use of insulin (-35%, -34%, and -13%), and quality-of-life measures (general health score increases of 17, 16, and 0.3; scores on the RAND 36-Item Health Survey ranged from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health) (P<0.05 for all comparisons). No major late surgical complications were reported except for one reoperation. Five-year outcome data showed that, among patients with type 2 diabetes and a BMI of 27 to 43, bariatric surgery plus intensive medical therapy was more effective than intensive medical therapy alone in decreasing, or in some cases resolving, hyperglycemia.

819,Effects of Bariatric Surgery in Obese Patients With Hypertension: The GATEWAY Randomized Trial (Gastric Bypass to Treat Obese Patients With Steady Hypertension).,"Recent research efforts on bariatric surgery have focused on metabolic and diabetes mellitus resolution. Randomized trials designed to assess the impact of bariatric surgery in patients with obesity and hypertension are needed. In this randomized, single-center, nonblinded trial, we included patients with hypertension (using â‰¥2 medications at maximum doses or >2 at moderate doses) and a body mass index between 30.0 and 39.9 kg/m2. Patients were randomized to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass plus medical therapy or medical therapy alone. The primary end point was reduction of â‰¥30% of the total number of antihypertensive medications while maintaining systolic and diastolic blood pressure <140 mmâ€‰Hg and 90 mmâ€‰Hg, respectively, at 12 months. We included 100 patients (70% female, mean age 43.8Â±9.2 years, mean body mass index 36.9Â±2.7 kg/m2), and 96% completed follow-up. Reduction of â‰¥30% of the total number of antihypertensive medications while maintaining controlled blood pressure occurred in 41 of 49 patients from the gastric bypass group (83.7%) compared with 6 of 47 patients (12.8%) from the control group with a rate ratio of 6.6 (95% confidence interval, 3.1-14.0; P<0.001). Remission of hypertension was present in 25 of 49 (51%) and 22 of 48 (45.8%) patients randomized to gastric bypass, considering office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, respectively, whereas no patient submitted to medical therapy was free of antihypertensive drugs at 12 months. A post hoc analysis for the primary end point considering the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) target reached consistent results, with a rate ratio of 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.4-10.6; P=0.005). Eleven patients (22.4%) from the gastric bypass group and none in the control group were able to achieve SPRINT levels without antihypertensives. Waist circumference, body mass index, fasting plasma glucose, glycohemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and 10-year Framingham risk score were lower in the gastric bypass than in the control group. Bariatric surgery represents an effective strategy for blood pressure control in a broad population of patients with obesity and hypertension. URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov.

496,The Short-Term Renal Effects of Bariatric Surgery: A Comparative Study Between Sleeve Gastrectomy and One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass Operations Among Egyptian Patients With Severe Obesity.,"Obesity is a major health problem with many renal sequelae. Bariatric surgery (BS) has become the treatment of choice for severe obesity. This study was conducted to assess the short-term renal effects of BS and to compare such effects between two distinct forms of BS. A single-center non-randomized prospective observational study was conducted on 57 patients with severe obesity. Two distinct forms of BS have been performed; laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). Anthropometric measurements, 24-h urinary creatinine clearance (CLCr), protein and oxalate excretion, and abdominal fat tissue analysis by computerized tomography were performed prior to surgery and 6Â months later. LSG and OAGB were performed in 47 and 10 participants, respectively. BS resulted in pronounced reduction of body mass index (-â€‰27.1%â€‰Â±â€‰7.11), with no substantial weight loss discrepancy between LSG and OAGB. The median percent change in 24-h urinary CLCr and protein and oxalate excretion were -â€‰35.7, -â€‰42.2, and -â€‰5.8, respectively. The median (IQR) percent change of urinary oxalate excretion was -â€‰11.1 (-â€‰22.6, -â€‰1.4) and 113.08 (82.5, 179.7) for LSG and OAGB, respectively (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The subcutaneous abdominal fat surface area has been found to be the significant predictor of the persistence of glomerular hyperfiltration after BS. Both LSG and OAGB can alleviate many of the obesity-related pathological renal changes. However, postoperative hyperoxaluria remains a serious issue particularly in OAGB. Detailed radiological abdominal fat tissue analysis by CT may aid in predicting the renal outcome following BS.",10.1007/s11695-020-04841-5,,,,99
590,"Gastric bypass versus sleeve gastrectomy in patients with type 2 diabetes (Oseberg): a single-centre, triple-blind, randomised controlled trial.","For patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes, weight loss improves insulin sensitivity and Î²-cell function, and can induce remission of diabetes. The comparative efficacy of various bariatric procedures for the remission of type 2 diabetes has not been fully elucidated. We aimed to compare the effects of the two most common bariatric procedures, gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, on remission of diabetes and Î²-cell function. We conducted a single-centre, triple-blind, randomised trial at Vestfold Hospital Trust (TÃ¸nsberg, Norway), in which patients (aged â‰¥18 years) with type 2 diabetes and obesity were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy (the Oseberg study). Randomisation was performed with a computerised random number generator and a block size of 10. Treatment allocation was masked from participants, study personnel, and outcome assessors and was concealed with sealed opaque envelopes. Surgeons used identical skin incisions during both surgeries and were not involved in patient follow-up. The primary clinical outcome was the proportion of participants with complete remission of type 2 diabetes (HbA1c of â‰¤6Â·0% [42 mmol/mol] without the use of glucose-lowering medication) at 1 year after surgery. The primary physiological outcome was disposition index (a measure of Î²-cell function) at 1 year after surgery, as assessed by an intravenous glucose tolerance test. Primary outcomes were analysed in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. This trial is ongoing and closed to recruitment, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01778738. Between Oct 15, 2012, and Sept 1, 2017, 1305 patients who were preparing for bariatric surgery were screened, of whom 319 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes were assessed for eligibility. 109 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to gastric bypass (n=54) or sleeve gastrectomy (n=55). 107 (98%) of 109 patients completed 1-year follow-up, with one patient in each group withdrawing after surgery (per-protocol population). In the intention-to-treat population, diabetes remission rates were higher in the gastric bypass group than in the sleeve gastrectomy group (risk difference 27% [95% CI 10 to 44]; relative risk [RR] 1Â·57 [1Â·14 to 2Â·16], p=0Â·0054); results were similar in the per-protocol population (risk difference 27% [95% CI 10 to 45]; RR 1Â·57 [1Â·14 to 2Â·15], p=0Â·0036). In the intention-to-treat population, disposition index increased in both groups (between-group difference 55 [-111 to 220], p=0Â·52); results were similar in the per-protocol population (between-group difference 21 [-214 to 256], p=0.86). In the gastric bypass group, ten of 54 participants had early complications and 17 of 53 had late side-effects. In the sleeve gastrectomy group, eight of 55 participants had early complications and 22 of 54 had late side-effects. No deaths occurred in either group. Gastric bypass was found to be superior to sleeve gastrectomy for remission of type 2 diabetes at 1 year after surgery, and the two procedures had a similar beneficial effect on Î²-cell function. The use of gastric bypass as the preferred bariatric procedure for patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes could improve diabetes care and reduce related societal costs.

979,"Effect of morbid obesity, gastric banding and gastric bypass on esophageal symptoms, mucosa and function.","Obesity and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are commonly associated diseases. Bariatric surgery has been shown to have various impacts on esophageal function and GERD. Our aim was to evaluate changes in symptoms, endoscopic findings, bolus passage and esophageal function in patients after primary gastric bypass surgery as compared to patients converted from gastric banding to gastric bypass. Obese patients scheduled for laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (naÃ¯ve-to-bypass) and patients who previously underwent gastric banding and were considered for conversion from gastric banding to gastric bypass (band-to-bypass) were included. Patients rated esophageal and epigastric symptoms (100 point VAS) and underwent upper endoscopy, impedance-manometry, and modified ""timed barium swallow"" before/after surgery. Data from 66 naÃ¯ve-to-bypass patients (51/66, 77Â % females, mean age 41.2Â Â±Â 11.1Â years) and 68 band-to-bypass patients (53/68, 78Â % females, mean age 43.8Â Â±Â 10.0Â years) were available for analysis. Esophageal symptoms, esophagitis, esophageal motility abnormalities and impaired esophageal bolus transit were more common in patients that underwent gastric banding compared to those that underwent gastric bypass. The majority of symptoms, lesions and abnormalities induced by gastric banding were decreased by conversion to gastric bypass. Esophagitis was present in 28/68 (41Â %) and 13/47 (28Â %) patients in the band-to-bypass group, pre- versus postoperatively, respectively, (pÂ <Â 0.05). The percentage of swallows with normal bolus transit increased following transformation from gastric band to gastric bypass (57.9Â Â±Â 4.1 and 83.6Â Â±Â 3.4Â %, respectively, pÂ <Â 0.01). From an esophageal perspective, gastric bypass surgery induces less motility disorders and esophageal symptoms and should be therefore favored over gastric banding in difficult to treat obese patients at risk of repeated bariatric surgery.",10.1007/s00464-016-4996-5,,,,101
510,Associations of Bariatric Interventions With Micronutrient and Endocrine Disturbances.,"Few studies have described the longitudinal trajectories of serum levels of micronutrients whose deficiencies are associated with serious sequelae following bariatric procedures, such as anemia, osteoporotic fractures, and neuropathies. Furthermore, previous studies comparing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) vs Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) or one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) procedures may have been limited by selection and confounding biases. To appraise the spectrum and temporal course of micronutrient deficiencies associated with bone metabolism and erythropoiesis after LSG vs OAGB or LRYGB procedures, using the propensity score as a balancing score. This prospective, longitudinal comparative effectiveness study was conducted at a high-volume bariatric unit in Singapore from September 1, 2008, to November 30, 2017, with a cutoff date for analysis of September 2018. Patients who underwent adjustable gastric banding, biliopancreatic diversion procedures, and intragastric balloon procedures were excluded. All other patients who underwent bariatric procedures were included. Data were analyzed from September 23 to 30, 2018. Serial assessment of 13 biochemical parameters at 12 time points for up to 5 years after bariatric procedure. Inverse probability-of-treatment weights were used to obtain estimates of the mean associations of variables assessed with the bariatric surgical interventions. Longitudinal trajectories were analyzed using mixed-effects generalized linear models to apportion the temporal variation of serum micronutrients into fixed-effects and random-effects components. A total of 688 patients were included in this study, of whom 499 underwent LSG (mean [SD] age, 41.5 [11.3] years; 318 [63.7%] women) and 189 underwent OAGB or LRYGB (mean [SD] age, 48.6 [9.4] years; 112 [59.3%] women). There were no differences during follow-up among patients who underwent LSG vs those who underwent OAGB or LRYGB in intact parathyroid hormone levels (mean difference, 7.05 [95% CI, -28.67 to 42.77] pg/mL; Pâ€‰=â€‰.70), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (mean difference, -0.72 [95% CI, -1.56 to 0.12] ng/mL; Pâ€‰=â€‰.09), or phosphate levels (mean difference, 0.006 [95% CI, -0.052 to 0.064] mg/dL; Pâ€‰=â€‰.83). Hemoglobin levels were a mean 0.63 (95% CI, 0.41 to 0.85) g/dL higher among patients who underwent LSG compared with those who underwent OAGB or LRYGB (Pâ€‰<â€‰.001), despite no differences in iron concentration levels (mean difference, 1.50 [95% CI, -1.39 to 4.39] Âµg/dL; Pâ€‰=â€‰.31), total iron-binding capacity (mean difference, 4.36 [95% CI, -5.25 to 13.98] Âµg/dL; Pâ€‰=â€‰.37), or ferritin levels (mean difference, 3.0 [95% CI, -13.0 to 18.9] ng/mL; Pâ€‰=â€‰.71). Compared with patients who underwent LSG procedures, patients who underwent OAGB or LRYGB had higher folate levels (mean difference, 2.376 [95% CI, 1.716 to 3.036] ng/mL; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001) but lower serum magnesium levels (mean difference, -0.25 [95% CI, -0.35 to -0.16] mg/dL; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001) and zinc levels (mean difference, -7.58 [95% CI, -9.92 to -5.24] Âµg/dL; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001).

These differences should be recognized in guidelines for postbariatric nutritional surveillance and prevention.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.5123,,,,102
684,Ten-year outcomes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy: an observational nonrandomized cohort study.,"Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has replaced Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) as the most commonly performed bariatric surgery procedure. Data on the long-term (up to 10 yr) outcomes after SG is scarce. No previous study has compared the long-term outcomes between RYGB and SG. To compare 10-year weight lost and 10-year remission rates of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia between RYGB and SG. University hospital, Spain. Nonrandomized cohort study including all patients that underwent RYGB or SG at our institution between January 2005 and March 2008. Participants were followed yearly after bariatric surgery. Data obtained at the 10-year evaluation after RYGB or SG (between January 2015 and March 2018) was analyzed. Main study outcomes were 10-year percentage of total weight lost and percentage of excess weight lost. Secondary outcomes included 10-year remission rates of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Between-groups differences in 10-year percentage of total weight lost and percentage of excess weight lost were evaluated using analysis of covariance. Association between type of surgery and remission rates of obesity-related co-morbidities were evaluated using logistic regression analyses. Five hundred four patients were included in the study, 390 underwent RYGB and 134 SG. Follow-up rate was 84.5%. Mean 10-year percentage of total weight lost and percentage of excess weight lost were 25.3 Â± 11.2% and 56.0 Â± 25.6% in the RYGB group, and 27.5 Â± 13.5% and 53.2 Â± 25.1% in the SG group (Pâ€¯=â€¯.853 and Pâ€¯=â€¯.746, respectively). In logistic regression analyses RYGB was superior to SG in achieving 10-year hypertension and dyslipidemia remission. This study suggested comparable effectiveness between SG and RYGB on weight loss.",10.1016/j.soard.2019.01.020,,,,103
133,Mid-Long-Term Effect of Metabolic Surgery on Type 2 Diabetes in Nonobese Patients: a Meta-analysis.,"This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis regarding the mid-long-term effect (â‰¥â€‰2-year follow-up) of metabolic surgery on T2DM in non-obese patients. PubMed, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched for clinical studies from inception to March 2023. Stata 12.0 was used for data aggregation. Sensitivity, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses were performed when feasible. This meta-analysis included 18 articles involving 548 patients. A pooled rate of 47.5% of T2DM remission was found after metabolic surgery. To be more specific, 83.5% was obtained for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)â€‰<â€‰7.0%, 45.1% for HbA1câ€‰<â€‰6.5%, and 40.4% for HbA1câ€‰<â€‰6.0%. Subgroup analysis showed that one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) had a higher remission rate (93.9%) than other surgeries. Studies conducted in America had a higher remission rate (61.4%) than in Asia (43.6%). Meta-regression analysis displayed that publication year, number of patients, study design, preoperative age, BMI, and quality assessment score were not significantly associated with T2DM remission rate. Additionally, metabolic surgery could result in significant reductions in BMI (-4.133Â kg/m2), weight (-9.874Â kg), HbA1c (-1.939%), fasting blood glucose, fasting C-peptide, and fasting insulin. However, metabolic surgery seemed to have poorer glycemic control in non-obese than obese T2DM patients. A moderate mid-long-term effect of T2DM remission was observed after metabolic surgery in non-obese patients. However, we still need more prospective multi-institutional studies using the same definitions for diabetes and the same surgical technique for the surgery. Without this, the exact role of bariatric surgery in non-obese patients is unanswered.",10.1007/s11695-023-06713-0,,,,104
1147,Gastric band is safe and effective at three years in a national study subgroup of non-morbidly obese patients.,"To analyze the 3-year outcomes of lower body mass index (BMI) (<35 kg/m2) adjustable gastric band (AGB) recipients across multiple sites in the French health insurance system. From prospectively collected data on a cohort of 517 morbidly obese Swedish Adjustable Gastric BandÂ® (SAGB) patients (Clinical Trials Web database, #NCT01183975), a retrospective analysis of a subgroup of 29 low-BMI patients was conducted. Patients had a severe obesity-related comorbidity, had undergone a prior bariatric procedure requiring reintervention, or had a maximum adult BMIâ‰¥40. Safety (mortality, adverse events) and effectiveness (BMI change, excess weight loss [EWL, %], total body weight loss [%TBWL], quality of life [QoL], and comorbidities) were evaluated. Multiple surgical teams/sites enrolled patients and performed SAGB procedures between September 2, 2007 and April 30, 2008. Of 29 low-BMI patients (mean age, 41.3Â±10.3 years), 89.7% were female, and obesity duration was 13.6Â±7.3 years. Mean BMI was 31.5Â±3.7; there were 37 comorbidities in 15/29 patients. At 3-year follow-up, BMI was 29.4Â±4.9 (mean change, -2.3Â±6.2; P=0.069); total cohort EWL, 7.3Â±74.8%; TBWL, 6.2Â±18.8%; BMIâ‰¥30 to <35 EWL, 38.8Â±48.0%; there were 7 comorbidities in 15/29 patients (P<0.031). There were 20 adverse events in 13 patients (44.8%); SAGBs were retained in 25/29 (86.2%) at 3 years. In a retrospective analysis of a subgroup of BMI<35 kg/m2 patients, some following a prior bariatric procedure, SAGB was found to be safe and effective at 3-year follow-up.",10.3325/cmj.2014.55.405,,,,105
1270,Sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass are equally effective in correcting insulin resistance.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) are associated with glucose metabolism improvement although data on insulin resistance remission rates after these procedures are lacking. Primary aim was to compare insulin resistance remission rates achieved after LRYGB and LSG, using population-specific HOMA-IR cut-off points. Secondary objectives were to analyze factors associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) complete remission according to the new American Diabetes Association criteria and to examine changes in HOMA-B during follow-up. Non-randomized, prospective cohort study of patients undergoing LRYGB or LSG with a minimal follow-up of 24 months. Patients on insulin therapy were excluded. At baseline, 56 (48.7%) of the 115 LRYGB group and 48 (61.5%) of the 78 LSG group had insulin resistance, and 29 (25.2%) and 20 (25.6%) T2DM, respectively. No differences were detected in insulin resistance remission rate (92.9% LRYGB and 87.5% LSG, pÂ =Â 0.355) nor in T2DM complete remission at 2 years (62.1 vs 60% respectively, pÂ =Â 0.992). Factors independently associated with T2DM complete remission were diabetes treatment and a greater decrease in 3-month HOMA-IR index. The HOMA-B index showed a progressive decline during follow-up. Both surgical techniques are equally effective in achieving insulin resistance normalization in the majority of severely obese patients. Three-month HOMA-IR reduction after surgery was the main predictor of T2DM complete remission.",10.1016/j.ijsu.2013.02.007,,,,106
653,Safety and efficacy of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy versus laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) are widely performed to cure obesity and obesity-related diseases. Our aim was to compare these two procedures. An electronic literature search was performed from inception to December 2018. The clinical outcomes between LSG and LRYGB were pooled using software RevMan5.3. A total of 1076 patients from 11 studies were analysed. LSG had shorter operation time (mean difference [MD]Â =Â -33.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], -46.04 to -21.57; PÂ <Â .00001) and less early complications rate (risk ratio [RR]Â =Â 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36-0.84; PÂ =Â .005) compared with LRYGB. There were no significant difference about the readmission rate (RRÂ =Â 0.57; 95% CI, 0.21-1.54; PÂ =Â .27) and re-operation rate (RRÂ =Â 0.43; 95% CI, 0.14-1.27; PÂ =Â .13) between LSG and LRYGB. The conversion to open rate and mortality rate within 30Â days was low in both LSG and LRYGB. Mean hospital stay in LSG group (0.3-5.2Â d) seems shorter than that in the LRYGB group (2.3-6.6Â d). As to the effect of LSG and LRYGB on the percentage of excess weight loss (EWL), there was no significant difference between these two surgeries in EWL (MDÂ =Â -4.05; 95% CI, -8.89 to 0.80; PÂ =Â .10). LSG was equal to LRYGB on remission of T2DM (RRÂ =Â 0.94; 95% CI, 0.84-1.06; PÂ =Â .31). Both LSG and LRYGB can be performed with very low conversion to open rate and mortality rate. The readmission rate and re-operation rate are comparable between these two surgeries. The efficacy of these two surgeries on EWL and T2DM is equivalent, but LSG has an advantage over LRYGB in operation time and early complications rate.",10.1111/jep.13170,,,,107
125,Efficacy and safety of revisional treatments for weight regain or insufficient weight loss after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Weight regain or inadequate weight loss following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass poses a significant clinical challenge. Our objective was to evaluate various revisional techniques for addressing weight regain and insufficient weight loss after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass through a systematic review and meta-analysis. We performed a literature search (in PubMed and Embase) on revisional interventions in collaboration with a medical information specialist. Measured outcomes included body mass index at intervention, total weight loss during follow-up, and complications. Random effects models were used to determine pooled effect size and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Thirty-nine studies were included: four studies reported on argon plasma coagulation, four studies on transoral outlet reduction, nine studies on transoral outlet reductionâ€‰+â€‰argon plasma coagulation, four studies on pouch/gastrojejunal anastomosis revision, five on laparoscopic gastric banding, two studies on laparoscopic gastric bandingâ€‰+â€‰pouch resizing, 10 on distalization-RYGB, and one on duodenal switch. All techniques resulted in short-term clinically relevant weight loss. Endoscopic procedures had a short follow-up and resulted in modest and temporary weight loss. Surgical revision techniques were successful for weight loss in longer term follow-up, at the expense of high complication rates.",10.1111/obr.13607,,,,108
838,Patient-Reported Outcome Measures 2Â Years After Standard and Distal Gastric Bypass-a Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial.,"The preferred surgical procedure for treating morbid obesity is debated. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are relevant for evaluation of the optimal bariatric procedure. A total of 113 patients with BMI from 50 to 60 were randomly assigned to standard (nÂ =Â 57) or distal (nÂ =Â 56) Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Validated PROMS questionnaires were completed at baseline and 2Â years after surgery. Data were analyzed using mixed models for repeated measures and the results are expressed as estimated means and mean changes. Obesity-related quality of life improved significantly after both procedures, without significant between-group differences (-Â 0.4 (95% CIÂ =Â -Â 8.4, 7.2) points, pÂ =Â 0.88, ESÂ =Â 0.06). Both groups had significant reductions in the number of weight-related symptoms and symptom distress score, with a mean group difference (95% CI) of 1.4 (-Â 0.3, 3.3) symptoms and 5.0 (2.9. 12.8) symptom distress score points. There were no between-group differences for uncontrolled eating (22.0 (17.2-26.7) vs. 28.9 (23.3-34.5) points), cognitive restraint (57.4 (52.0-62.7) vs. 62.1 (57.9-66.2) points), and emotional eating (26.8 (20.5-33.1) vs. 32.6 (25.5-39.7) points). The prevalence of anxiety was 33% after standard and 25% after distal RYGB (pÂ =Â 0.53), and for depression 12 and 9%, respectively (pÂ =Â 0.76). There were no statistically significant differences between standard and distal RYGB 2Â years post surgery regarding weight loss, obesity-related quality of life, weight-related symptoms, anxiety, depression, or eating behavior.

531,Acceleration of Gastric Emptying and Improvement of GERD Outcome After Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy in Non-diabetic Obese Patients.,"Obesity has become a pandemic nowadays. Bariatric surgery is increasingly performed to manage obesity. Currently, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a widely accepted procedure given its feasibility and efficacy. Previous studies revealed conflicting results regarding the change of gastric emptying following sleeve gastrectomy. The primary aim of the present study is to assess gastric motor function by gastric emptying scintigraphy in a cohort of non-diabetic patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) for treatment of severe obesity. This prospective observational study included 100 obese, non-diabetic patients attending the surgery clinic at Cairo University Hospitals and Al Azhar University Hospitals. LSG was performed following a standardized protocol, with no complications observed. All patients had gastric emptying scintigraphy done through a standard semisolid meal (250Â kcal), marked with 0.5 mCiTc 99, pre-operatively and 3Â months after LSG. The mean age was 38.71Â years (9.2) and males comprised 57% of the cohort. The body mass index, low-density lipoproteins, and glycated hemoglobin declined significantly at 3-month postsurgery. The scintigraphy study revealed a significantly reduced percent retention at equivalent time points 3Â months after LSG. In addition, the percent of patients suffering from GERD decreased significantly after LSG. Gastric emptying becomes faster after LSG in morbidly obese non-diabetic patients. GERD symptoms improve after surgery.",10.1007/s11695-020-04547-8,,,,110
422,Changes in fasting bile acid profiles after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy.,"Bile acid is an essential factor that plays a role in metabolic regulation, but how bile acid is regulated after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) remains unclear. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate changes in the levels of fasting bile acids following RYGB and SG. A systematic literature search of the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases through July 2020 was performed in accordance with the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The concentrations of bile acids were evaluated. Thirteen studies with 289 patients were included. Our results showed that patients who underwent RYGB had increased levels of fasting total bile acids, primary bile acids, secondary bile acids, conjugated bile acids, and unconjugated bile acids, but no significant differences in all these bile acid levels were observed in patients who underwent SG. Furthermore, 12a-hydroxylated bile acid levels and the 12a-hydroxylated/non-12a-hydroxylated bile acid ratio also increased following RYGB. In this study, we found that fasting bile acid levels, especially 12a-hydroxylated bile acids levels, were increased after RYGB. However, no differences in fasting bile acid levels were observed following SG.",10.1097/MD.0000000000023939,,,,111
508,Robotic-assisted approaches to GERD following sleeve gastrectomy.,"Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is the most common bariatric operation in the United States but increases the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The aim of our study was to describe our experience with robotic-assisted management of intractable GERD after SG. A systematic review of a prospectively maintained database was performed of consecutive patients undergoing robotic-assisted magnetic sphincter augmentation placement after sleeve gastrectomy (MSA-S group) or conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB group) for GERD from 2015 to 2019 at our tertiary- care bariatric center. These were compared to a consecutive group of patients undergoing robotic-assisted magnetic sphincter augmentation placement (MSA group) for GERD without a history of bariatric surgery from 2016 to 2019. The primary outcome was perioperative morbidity. Secondary outcomes were operative time (OT), 90-day re-intervention rate, length of stay, symptom resolution and weight change. There were 51 patients included in this study; 18 patients in the MSA group, 13 patients in the MSA-S group, and 20 patients in the RYGB group. There was no significant difference in age, gender, ASA score, preoperative endoscopic findings, or DeMeester scores (Pâ€‰>â€‰0.05). BMI was significantly higher in patients undergoing RYGB compared to MSA or MSA-S (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). There were significant differences in OT between the MSA and RYGB groups (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001) and MSA-S and RYGB groups (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.009), but not MSA group to MSA-S group (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.51). There was no significant difference in intraoperative and postoperative morbidity (Pâ€‰=â€‰1.0 and Pâ€‰=â€‰0.60, respectively). 30-day morbidity: 5.6% (MSA), 15.4% (MSA-S) and 15% (RYGB). There was no difference on PPI discontinuation among groups, with more than 80% success rate in all. The use of the robotic platform in the different approaches available for treatment of GERD after SG appears to be a feasible option with low morbidity and high success rate. Further data is needed to support our findings.",10.1007/s00464-020-07753-8,,,,112
602,Revisional bariatric surgery due to failure of the initial technique: 25 years of experience in a specialized Unit of Obesity Surgery in Spain.,"To evaluate the effectiveness of conversion surgery in a bariatric surgery unit with 25years of experience. Retrospective observational study of patients with typeII obesity or higher who were reoperated by means of conversion surgery due to weight regain, residual body mass index (BMI)>35kg/m2 or <50% of excess weight loss. The demographic and anthropometric data, comorbidities and perioperative data were analyzed in 5 periods of time: initial, post-surgery1, pre-surgery2, post-surgery2 and current. A total of 112 patients were included, with a mean age of 40.2years, who initially underwent vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) (32.1%), gastric banding (GB) (23.2%), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) (21.4%) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) (23.2%). The conversion techniques, with a median time between the two surgeries of 70months, included: RYGB, SG, one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB), shortening of the common loop (SCL) and biliopancreatic diversion (BPD). There was a reduction of the initial weight from 144.2Â±30.3 to 101.5Â±21.8kg after surgery-1; from 115.6Â±24.0 to 91.5Â±19.0kg after surgery-2. The weight at present is 94.7Â±16.4kg, with a median follow-up of 27.5months. Similar results were seen with the BMI. The improvement of comorbidities mainly occurred after the first intervention. Conversion surgery causes a weight reduction that does not exceed the loss achieved after the first surgery; however, it does manage to stabilize weight over time. The perioperative morbidity rate is acceptable and would justify its application, despite the limited impact on comorbidities.",10.1016/j.ciresp.2019.07.012,,,,113
1075,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for diabetes (the Diabetes Surgery Study): 2-year outcomes of a 5-year, randomised, controlled trial.","Conventional treatments for patients with type 2 diabetes are often inadequate. We aimed to assess outcomes of diabetes control and treatment risks 2 years after adding Roux-en-Y gastric bypass to intensive lifestyle and medical management. We report 2-year outcomes of a 5-year randomised trial (the Diabetes Surgery Study) at four teaching hospitals (three in the USA and one in Taiwan). At baseline, eligible participants had to have HbA1c of at least 8Â·0% (64 mmol/mol), BMI between 30Â·0 and 39Â·9 kg/m(2), and type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months, and be aged 30-67 years. We randomly assigned participants to receive either intensive lifestyle and medical management alone (lifestyle and medical management), or lifestyle and medical management plus standard Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (gastric bypass). Staff from the clinical centres had access to data from individual patients, but were masked to other patients' data and aggregated data until the 2-year follow-up. Drugs for hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia were prescribed by protocol. The primary endpoint was achievement of the composite treatment goal of HbA1c less than 7Â·0% (53 mmol/mol), LDL cholesterol less than 2Â·59 mmol/L, and systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg at 12 months; here we report the composite outcome and other pre-planned secondary outcomes at 24 months. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis, with multiple imputations for missing data. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00641251, and is still ongoing. Between April 21, 2008, and Nov 21, 2011, we randomly assigned 120 eligible patients to either lifestyle and medical management alone (n=60) or with the addition of gastric bypass (n=60). One patient in the lifestyle and medical management group died (from pancreatic cancer), thus 119 were included in the primary analysis. Significantly more participants in the gastric bypass group achieved the composite triple endpoint at 24 months than in the lifestyle and medical management group (26 [43%] vs eight [14%]; odds ratio 5Â·1 [95% CI 2Â·0-12Â·6], p=0Â·0004), mainly through improved glycaemic control (HbA1c <7Â·0% [53 mmol/mol] in 45 [75%] vs 14 [24%]; treatment difference -1Â·9% (-2Â·5 to -1Â·4); p=0Â·0001). 46 clinically important adverse events occurred in the gastric bypass group and 25 in the lifestyle and medical management group (mainly infections in both groups [four in the lifestyle and medical management group, eight in the gastric bypass group]). With a negative binomial model adjusted for site, the event rate for the gastric bypass group was non-significantly higher than the lifestyle and medical management group by a factor of 1Â·67 (95% CI 0Â·98-2Â·87, p=0Â·06). Across both years of the study, the gastric bypass group had seven serious falls with five fractures, compared with three serious falls and one fracture in the lifestyle and medical management group. All fractures happened in women. Many more nutritional deficiencies occurred in the gastric bypass group (mainly deficiencies in iron, albumin, calcium, and vitamin D), despite protocol use of nutritional supplements. The addition of gastric bypass to lifestyle and medical management in patients with type 2 diabetes improved diabetes control, but adverse events and nutritional deficiencies were more frequent. Larger and longer studies are needed to investigate whether the benefits and risk of gastric bypass for type 2 diabetes can be balanced.

851,Bile acid profiles over 5 years after gastric bypass and duodenal switch: results from a randomized clinical trial.,"Bile acids have been proposed as key mediators of the metabolic effects after bariatric surgery. Currently no reports on bile acid profiles after duodenal switch exist, and long-term data after gastric bypass are lacking. To investigate bile acid profiles up to 5 years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch and to explore the relationship among bile acids and weight loss, lipid profile, and glucose metabolism. Two Scandinavian University Hospitals. We present data from a randomized clinical trial of 60 patients with body mass index 50-60 kg/m2 operated with gastric bypass or duodenal switch. Repeated measurements of total and individual bile acids from fasting serum during 5 years after surgery were performed. Mean concentrations of total bile acids increased from 2.3 Âµmol/L (95% confidence interval [CI], -.1 to 4.7) at baseline to 5.9 Âµmol/L (3.5-8.3) 5 years after gastric bypass and from 1.0 Âµmol/L (95% CI, -1.4 to 3.5) to 9.5 Âµmol/L (95% CI, 7.1-11.9) after duodenal switch; mean between-group difference was -4.8 Âµmol/L (95% CI, -9.3 to -.3), P = .036. Mean concentrations of primary bile acids increased more after duodenal switch, whereas secondary bile acids increased proportionally across the groups. Higher levels of total bile acids at 5 years were associated with lower body mass index, greater weight loss, and lower total cholesterol. Total bile acid concentrations increased substantiallyÂ over 5 yearsÂ after both gastric bypass and duodenal switch, with greater increases in total and primary bile acids after duodenal switch.

820,Bariatric Surgery as an Efficient Treatment for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in a Prospective Study with 1-Year Follow-up : BariScan Study.,"Bariatric surgery gains attention as a potential treatment for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The present study aimed to evaluate improvement of NAFLD after the two most common bariatric procedures with validated non-invasive instruments. NÂ =Â 100 patients scheduled for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) were included. NAFLD was evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively with liver stiffness measurement by transient elastography and laboratory-based fibrosis scores. Clinical data included body mass index (BMI), total weight loss (%TWL), excess weight loss (%EWL), age, gender, comorbidities, and the Edmonton obesity staging system (EOSS). There were significant improvements of BMI, %TWL, %EWL, and EOSS after bariatric surgery. Liver stiffness was significantly improved from pre- to postoperative (12.9Â Â±Â 10.4 vs. 7.1Â Â±Â 3.7Â kPa, pÂ <Â 0.001) at median follow-up of 12.5Â months. Additionally, there were significant improvements of liver fibrosis scores (aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio 0.8Â Â±Â 0.3 vs. 1.1Â Â±Â 0.4, pÂ <Â 0.001; NAFLD fibrosis score -Â 1.0Â Â±Â 1.8 vs. -Â 1.7Â Â±Â 1.3, pÂ <Â 0.001; APRI score 0.3Â Â±Â 0.2 vs. 0.3Â Â±Â 0.1, pÂ =Â 0.009; BARD score 2.3Â Â±Â 1.2 vs. 2.8Â Â±Â 1.1, pÂ =Â 0.008) and laboratory parameters (ALT, AST, and GGT). After adjustment for baseline liver stiffness, RYGB showed higher improvements than LSG, and there was no gender difference. Improvement of liver stiffness was not correlated to improvement of BMI, %TWL, %EWL, or EOSS. NAFLD seems to be improved by bariatric surgery as measured by validated non-invasive instruments. Furthermore, it appears that RYGB is more effective than LSG. No correlation could be detected between NAFLD and weight loss. The present study highlights the potential of bariatric surgery for successful treatment of NAFLD. Further research is required to understand the exact mechanisms.",10.1007/s11695-017-3012-z,,,,116
351,Comparative Effectiveness of Bariatric Surgeries in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and BMIâ€‰â‰¥â€‰25Â kg/m2: a Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.,"In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), bariatric surgery appears to be more effective than medical treatment (MT) at improving glycaemic control and decreasing cardiovascular risk. However, long-term effectiveness has not been systematically assessed using randomised controlled trials. In this study, we aimed to systematically assess randomised controlled trials, with at least 5Â years of follow-up, on bariatric surgery in patients with T2DM and BMIâ€‰â‰¥â€‰25Â kg/m2, as well as to compare different bariatric procedures. PubMed, SCOPUS and Web of Science were searched. We performed a network meta-analysis to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the different procedures and MT in terms of full T2DM remission, weight loss, complications and cardiometabolic biomarkers. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and CINeMA. We included 11 primary studies. Laparoscopic one-anastomosis gastric bypass (LOAGB) was found to be one of the most effective treatments for full remission of T2DM (I2â€‰=â€‰0, inconsistency p valueâ€‰=â€‰0.9223). Biliopancreatic diversion without duodenal switch was found to be more effective than laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding regarding percent total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein change. Regarding percent high-density lipoprotein and weight change, all analysed surgical treatments were shown to be more effective than MT. The confidence rating in our results was overall moderate, but most studies had high risk of performance and detection bias. Bariatric surgery seems to be effective for T2DM remission. LOAGB appears to be a good option in this context, and a possible alternative to laparoscopic duodenal switch, but the included primary studies in our review are not sufficiently powered to establish a more definitive conclusion. More studies with longer follow-up times are needed to comprehensively assess bariatric surgery in T2DM.",10.1007/s11695-021-05725-y,,,,117

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Short-Term Results.,"To systematically review the efficacy of short length of biliopancreatic limb (BPL) in laparoscopic one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). By thoroughly investigating in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, each research containing the comparison between short BPL and 200-cm BPL was included, inception in July 2021. The research followed the guidance of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) recommendations. A total of 1288 patients were included for meta-analysis. Results showed that in the short term, compared with 200-cm BPL, percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) did not show significant reduction (pâ€‰=â€‰0.91), neither did the incidence of vitamin D deficiency (pâ€‰=â€‰0.87) nor hypoalbuminemia (pâ€‰=â€‰0.06), while percentage total weight loss (%TWL) was significantly higher in the 200-cm BPL group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0005). At 1, 2, and 8Â years postoperatively, patients with short BPL still obtained significantly reduced body mass index (BMI). Short BPL shows significant effect of weight loss; however, it seems no significantly lower rates of adverse events in the short term are found. More research with randomized controlled design is encouraged to further address the incidence of adverse events in the long term.",10.1007/s11695-022-06048-2,,,,118
592,Remission of Type 2 Diabetes and Sleeve Gastrectomy in Morbid Obesity: a Comparative Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"The sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has gained popularity which has resulted in a rising number of patients with T2DM to undergo this procedure. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the long-term effects of SG on T2DM remission with remission seen after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or gastric banding (GB). A literature search was performed in PubMed and Cochrane Library using the following search terms: 'sleeve gastrectomy', 'diabetes', 'gastric bypass' and 'gastric banding'. Studies published between January 2000 and April 2018, and with following inclusion criteria were selected for this review: BMI â‰¥ 35 kg/m2, age â‰¥ 18 years, follow-up â‰¥ 1 year, T2DM. Data was statistically analysed using a random-effects model and results were expressed as odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. After exclusion, 35 out of an initial 748 studies, consisting of 18 138 T2DM patients, remained for inclusion. Of these patients, 2480 underwent a SG. The remaining patients underwent a RYGB (n = 10,597) or GB (n = 5061). One year postoperatively, SG patients reached significantly (OR 0.71, p = 0.003) less T2DM remission than RYGB. After stratifying for different criteria for remission, RYGB still tended to result in higher remission rates, but the difference was not statistically significant. Beyond 1 year of follow-up, the difference between RYGB and SG in terms of T2DM remission decreased. SG was superior to the GB (OR 2.17, p = 0.001) after 1 year of follow-up. This review demonstrates important remission of T2DM following SG. Nevertheless, as remission was significantly more often observed following RYGB surgery, the latter procedure remains the gold standard for reaching T2DM remission in patients with concurrent obesity.",10.1007/s11695-019-04199-3,,,,119
608,An Extended Pouch in a Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass Reduces Weight Regain: 3-Year Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Although the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is considered a standard procedure, many variations exist in the basic design. In order to achieve more pronounced and sustainable results after RYGB, factors such as diameter of the gastroenterostomy, limb length, and pouch size are gripping points for improvement of design. Extending the pouch could improve results by altering food passage through the pouch. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effect of an extended pouch RYGB (EP-GB) and standard pouch RYGB (S-GB). In total, 132 patients were randomized in two groups: 68 patients received an EP-GB (pouch length 10Â cm) and 64 a S-GB (pouch length 5Â cm). Subsequently, weight loss, remission of comorbidities, nutritional status, complications, quality of life, and GERD-symptoms were assessed during a follow-up of 3Â years. During the first 2Â years of follow-up, no significant differences in terms of weight loss were observed. In the third year of follow-up, the S-GB group regained 3Â kg, while in the EP-GB group no weight regain was observed. The mean TBWL after 36Â months in the EP-GB group was 31% versus 27% in the S-GB group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.023). Additionally, besides a better remission rate of hypertension in the EP-GB group, no differences in complications, quality of life, and GERD-symptoms were found. Creation of an extended gastric pouch is a safe and effective modification in RYGB design. An EP-GB improves mid-term weight loss, potentially driven by a lower occurrence of weight regain.",10.1007/s11695-019-04156-0,,,,120
853,Ten-year Outcomes of a Prospective Randomized Trial of Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass Versus Laparoscopic Gastric Banding.,"The primary endpoints of this study were long-term weight loss, morbidity, and changes in comorbidities and quality of life. Bariatric surgery is an effective option for the treatment of severe obesity and its related comorbidities. However, few studies have reported on the long-term outcome (>5 yrs) of bariatric surgery. Between 2002 and 2007, 250 patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 to 60â€Škg/m were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic gastric bypass or laparoscopic gastric banding. After exclusions, 111 patients underwent gastric bypass and 86 patients underwent gastric banding. Factors predictive of improved weight loss were analyzed using multiple logistic regressions. At baseline, the mean age was 43â€ŠÂ±â€Š10 years and the mean BMI was 46.5â€ŠÂ±â€Š5.6â€Škg/m. At 10-year follow-up, the mean total body weight loss for the entire cohort was -37.5â€ŠÂ±â€Š19.4â€Škg, -42.4â€ŠÂ±â€Š19.6â€Škg for gastric bypass versus -27.4â€ŠÂ±â€Š14.5â€Škg for gastric banding. Late reoperation was significantly higher after gastric banding compared with the gastric bypass group (31.4% vs. 8.1%, respectively, P < 0.01). For the entire cohort, improvement or remission of diabetes occurred in 68%; 61% for hypertension; and 57% for dyslipidemia. The long-term mortality for the entire cohort was 1.0% at a mean follow-up of 9.5â€ŠÂ±â€Š0.4 years. Factors predictive of improved weight loss included the type of operation (ie, gastric bypass), female sex, and the absence of diabetes at baseline. At long-term follow-up, quality of life continues to be improved from baseline for both the groups. Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for severe obesity with durable 10-year weight loss and improvement in comorbidities and quality of life. Compared with gastric banding, gastric bypass was associated with better long-term weight loss, lower rate of late reoperation, and improved remission of comorbidities.",10.1097/SLA.0000000000002348,,,,121
414,Factors associated with weight regain post-bariatric surgery: a systematic review.,"To systematically review the literature to assess the incidence and risk factors of weight regain (WR) after bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery is the most effective intervention for sustained weight loss of morbidly obese patients, but WR remains a concern. A PRISMA compliant systematic literature review was performed using the PubMed database, Embase and the Cochrane Library in July of 2019. Studies that reportedâ€‰â‰¥â€‰10% WR after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) were included. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) was used for assessing study quality. Out of 2915 retrieved abstracts, 272 full papers were reviewed, and 32 studies included (25 of high and 7 of fair quality) reporting weight outcomes on 7391 RYGB and 5872 SG patients. 17.6% (95% CI 16.9-18.3) had a WRâ€‰â‰¥â€‰10%. Risk factors related with WR fell into 5 categories, namely anatomical, genetic, dietary, psychiatric, and temporal. Specifically, gastrojejunal stoma diameter, gastric volume following sleeve, anxiety, time after surgery, sweet consumption, emotional eating, portion size, food urges, binge eating, loss of control/disinhibition when eating, and genetics have been positively associated with WR while postprandial GLP-1, eagerness to change physical activity habits, self-esteem, social support, fruit and zinc consumption, HDL, quality of life have been negatively associated. At least 1 in 6 patients after bariatric surgery hadâ€‰â‰¥â€‰10% WR. This review identified several factors related to WR that can be used to counsel patients preoperatively and direct postoperative strategies that minimize WR risk.",10.1007/s00464-021-08329-w,,,,122
1344,A comparison of postoperative quality of life and dysfunction after Billroth I and Roux-en-Y reconstruction following distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer: results from a multi-institutional RCT.,"Both Billroth I (B-I) and Roux-en-Y (R-Y) reconstructions are commonly performed as standard procedures, but it has yet to be determined which reconstruction is better for patients. A randomized prospective phase II trial with body weight loss at 1Â year after surgery as a primary endpoint was performed to address this issue. The current report delivers data on the quality of life and degree of postoperative dysfunction, which were the secondary endpoints of this study. Gastric cancer patients who underwent distal gastrectomy were intraoperatively randomized to B-I or R-Y. Postsurgical QOL was evaluated using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and DAUGS 20. Between August 2005 and December 2008, 332 patients were enrolled in a randomized trial comparing B-I versus R-Y. A mail survey questionnaire sent to 327 patients was completed by 268 (86.2%) of them. EORTC QLQ-C30 scores were as follows: global health status was similar in each group (B-I 73.5Â Â±Â 18.8, R-Y 73.2Â Â±Â 20.2, pÂ =Â 0.87). Scores of five functional scales were also similar. Only the dyspnea symptom scale showed superior results for R-Y than for B-I (B-I 13.6Â Â±Â 17.9, R-Y 8.6Â Â±Â 16.3, pÂ =Â 0.02). With respect to DAUGS 20, the total score did not differ significantly between the R-Y and B-I groups (24.8 vs. 23.6, pÂ =Â 0.41). Only reflux symptoms were significantly worse for B-I than for R-Y (0.7Â Â±Â 0.6 vs. 0.5Â Â±Â 0.6, pÂ =Â 0.01). The B-I and R-Y techniques were generally equivalent in terms of postoperative QOL and dysfunction. Both procedures seem acceptable as standard reconstructions after distal gastrectomy with regard to postoperative QOL and dysfunction.",10.1007/s10120-011-0098-1,,,,123
1471,Gastric banding or bypass? A systematic review comparing the two most popular bariatric procedures.,"Bariatric surgical procedures have increased exponentially in the United States. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding is now promoted as a safer, potentially reversible and effective alternative to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, the current standard of care. This study evaluated the balance of patient-oriented clinical outcomes for laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The MEDLINE database (1966 to January 2007), Cochrane clinical trials database, Cochrane reviews database, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects were searched using the key terms gastroplasty, gastric bypass, laparoscopy, Swedish band, and gastric banding. Studies with at least 1 year of follow-up that directly compared laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were included. Resolution of obesity-related comorbidities, percentage of excess body weight loss, quality of life, perioperative complications, and long-term adverse events were the abstracted outcomes. The search identified 14 comparative studies (1 randomized trial). Few studies reported outcomes beyond 1 year. Excess body weight loss at 1 year was consistently greater for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass than laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (median difference, 26%; range, 19%-34%; P < .001). Resolution of comorbidities was greater after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. In the highest-quality study, excess body weight loss was 76% with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus 48% with laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, and diabetes resolved in 78% versus 50% of cases, respectively. Both operating room time and length of hospitalization were shorter for those undergoing laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Adverse events were inconsistently reported. Operative mortality was less than 0.5% for both procedures. Perioperative complications were more common with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (9% vs 5%), whereas long-term reoperation rates were lower after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (16% vs 24%). Patient satisfaction favored Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (P=.006). Weight loss outcomes strongly favored Roux-en-Y gastric bypass over laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Patients treated with laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding had lower short-term morbidity than those treated with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, but reoperation rates were higher among patients who received laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Gastric bypass should remain the primary bariatric procedure used to treat obesity in the United States.",10.1016/j.amjmed.2008.05.036,,,,124
1095,"Perioperative Outcomes of Proximal and Distal Gastric Bypass in Patients with BMI Ranged 50-60 kg/m(2)--A Double-Blind, Randomized Controlled Trial.","Proximal Roux-en-Y gastric bypass may not ensure adequate weight loss in superobese patients. Bypassing a longer segment of the small bowel may increase weight loss. The objective of the study was to compare the perioperative outcomes of laparoscopic proximal and distal gastric bypass in a double-blind randomized controlled trial of superobese patients. The study was conducted at two public tertiary care obesity centers in Norway. Patients with body mass index (BMI) 50-60Â kg/m(2) were randomly assigned to a proximal (150Â cm alimentary limb) or a distal (150Â cm common channel) gastric bypass. The biliopancreatic limb was 50Â cm in both operations. Patients and follow-up personnel were blinded to the type of procedure. Thirty-day outcomes including complications are reported. We operated on 115 patients, of whom two were excluded at surgery, leaving 56 and 57 patients in the proximal group and distal group, respectively. The median (range) operating time was 72 (36-151) and 101â€‰(59-227)â€‰min, respectively (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Two distal procedures were converted to laparotomy during the primary procedure. Median length of hospital stay was 2â€‰(1-4)â€‰days in the proximal group and 2â€‰(1-24)â€‰days in the distal group. The number of patients with complications and complications categorized according to the Contracted Accordion classification did not differ significantly. However, all six reoperations were performed in the distal group, of which three were completed by laparoscopy (pâ€‰=â€‰0.01 between groups). There were no deaths. In superobese patients with BMI between 50 and 60Â kg/m(2), distal gastric bypass was associated with longer operating time and more severe complications resulting in reoperation than proximal gastric bypass.",10.1007/s11695-015-1621-y,,,,125
224,[Analysis of early severe postoperative complications and risk factors in 4255 patients who underwent bariatric and metabolic surgery in a single cente].,"Objective: To analyze the incidence of early severe complications following bariatric and metabolic surgery and the experience of their diagnosis, treatment, and risk factors. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, the clinical data of 4255 patients who underwent bariatric and metabolic surgery between May 2010 and May 2022 in the Department of Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University were retrospectively collected. Among these patients, 1125 were male and 3130 were female. The mean age and body mass index (BMI) of the patients at the time of operation were 31.3Â±4.5 years and 36.5Â±6.4 kg/m2, respectively. Regarding surgical type, 2397 patients underwent sleeve gastrectomy (SG), 489 underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), 1028 underwent sleeve gastrectomy plus jejunojejunal bypass (SG+JJB), and 341 underwent single anastomosis duodenal switch (SADS). The inclusion criteria were patients (1) with a Clavien-Dindo grade of â‰¥III; (2) who were undergoing SG, RYGB, SG-JJB, or SADS; and (3) who had complete clinical data. The exclusion criteria were patients (1) undergoing revisional surgery and (2) other operations during the bariatric and metabolic surgery. The Clavien-Dindo classification was used to analyze the incidence of early severe postoperative complications and their prognosis. Early severe postoperative complications were defined as Clavien-Dindo â‰¥ III complications within 30 days after surgery. Meanwhile, multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify risk factors of the complications. Results: Summary of early severe complications following bariatric and metabolic surgery: (1) of the 4255 patients, 22 (12 male and 10 female) exhibited early severe complications (0.52%). The mean age and BMI of these patients were 41.1Â±9.9 years and 36.9Â±8.2 kg/m2, respectively. Preoperatively, 7 patients had hypertension, 10 had type 2 diabetes mellitus, 1 had respiratory failure, and 1 had heart failure. The severe complications included 9 patients (0.21%) with grade IIIa, 11 (0.26%) with grade IIIb, 1 (0.02%) with grade IVa, and 1 (0.02%) with grade V complications. The incidences of severe postoperative complications in the different surgical procedures were 0.17% for SG (4/2397), 0.61% for RYGB (3/489), 0.58% for SG+JJB (6/1028), and 2.64% for SADS (9/341). The common severe complications were leakage (0.28%, 12 patients), bleeding (0.14%, 6 patients), and obstruction (0.05%, 2 patients). (2) Management of complications: Grade IIIa complications (including eight patients with leakage and one with severe inflammation) were treated with antibiotics, nasogastric and nutritional tube placements, and CT-guided drainage. For grade IIIa complications, five patients with bleeding were treated with reoperation, and all the patients recovered; four patients with leakage were treated with reoperation, wherein three were converted to RYGB and one patient underwent resuturing of the leakage site; two patients with obstruction were treated with adhesiolysis. The patient with grade IVa complication (including respiratory failure complicated with acid aspiration) was treated in the ICU. For the grade V complication, bleeding in a patient with SG+JJB was treated with reoperation, which confirmed the bleeding of short gastric vessels. Unfortunately, the patient died. (3) Risk factor analysis of early severe complications: univariate analysis detected that sex, age, type 2 diabetes mellitus, operation time, and surgical type were associated with postoperative complications (P<0.05). However, multivariate analysis indicated that an age of â‰¥31.3 years (odds ratio [OR] = 5.423, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.004-29.278, P=0.049) and surgical type (SADS: OR = 19.758, 95%CI: 5.803-67.282, P<0.001; RYGB: OR = 9.752, 95%CI: 2.456-38.723, P=0.001; SG+JJB: OR = 5.706, 95%CI: 1.966- 16.559, P=0.001) were independent risk factors of early severe complications following bariatric and metabolic surgery. Conclusion: Bariatric and metabolic surgery is safe. Its common postoperative complications include leakage, bleeding, and obstruction, which require early detection, diagnosis, and treatment to improve treatment outcomes. Age and surgical type are independent risk factors of early severe complications following bariatric and metabolic surgery.",10.3760/cma.j.cn441530-20220712-00300,,,,126
208,Biliopancreatic Limb Length as a Potential Key Factor in Superior Glycemic Outcomes After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: A Meta-Analysis.,"Optimal length of biliopancreatic (BP) and Roux limb in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) for improved glycemic control are not known. To investigate how the lengths of the BP and Roux limbs in RYGB differentially affect postoperative glycemic outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. We conducted a systematic literature search using the PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases. We included studies that reported glycemic outcomes after RYGB and lengths of the BP and Roux limbs. A total of 28 articles were included for data extraction. Glycemic outcomes after RYGB were assessed on the basis of two definitions: remission and improvement. We categorized the included studies into four groups according to the BP and Roux limb lengths. The type 2 diabetes remission/improvement rates were as follows: long BP-long Roux group 0.80 (95% CI 0.70-0.90)/0.81 (0.73-0.89), long BP-short Roux group 0.76 (0.66-0.87)/0.82 (0.75-0.89), short BP-long Roux group 0.57 (0.36-0.78)/0.64 (0.53-0.75), and short BP-short Roux group 0.62 (0.43-0.80)/0.53 (0.45-0.61). Meta-regression analysis also showed that a longer BP limb resulted in higher postoperative type 2 diabetes remission and improvement rates, whereas a longer Roux limb did not. There was no significant difference or heterogeneity in baseline characteristics, including diabetes-related variables, among the four groups. Not all included studies were randomized controlled trials. Longer BP limb length led to higher rates of type 2 diabetes remission and improvement by 1 year after RYGB in comparisons with the longer Roux limb length.",10.2337/dc22-0835,,,,127
526,Comparative Safety and Effectiveness of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy in Obese Elder Patients: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"This study aimed to compare the safety and effectiveness of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in patients aged 60Â years old or older. The available literature was searched for eligible studies up to November 2019. The meta-analysis was performed by the RevMan 5.3 software. This meta-analysis involved nineteen studies. The rates of early and late complications in RYGB were much higher than those in SG. More specifically, within 30Â days after surgeries, leak, urinary tract infection, obstruction, and death occurred more often in the RYGB group. The above differences may lead to higher rates of hospital readmission and return to the operating room. RYGB was superior to SG in terms of remission of hypertension and the 1-year follow-up weight loss outcome, while there were no differences in terms of remission of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as well as weight loss outcomes during 2- and 3-year follow-up. SG was the preferable option to RYGB for patients aged 60Â years old or older, as SG has been shown not inferior to RYGB in terms of effectiveness, while being safer than RYGB.",10.1007/s11695-020-04577-2,,,,128
579,"Long-Term Weight Loss and Metabolic Syndrome Remission after Bariatric Surgery: The Effect of Sex, Age, Metabolic Parameters and Surgical Technique - A 4-Year Follow-Up Study.","Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity and its metabolic related comorbidities. However, the literature reports inconsistent results regarding weight loss (WL) and the resolution of comorbidities associated with obesity. We aim to evaluate long-term differences in WL between different surgical techniques and the impact of each surgical technique on metabolic parameters (type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM], dyslipidemia,hypertension, and metabolic syndrome). We also aim to evaluate the effect of baseline clinical characteristics in WL and in the evolution of metabolic syndrome (MetS) components. Our hypothesis is that different types of surgery have different effects on WL and the prevalence of comorbidities over time. We retrospectively evaluated WL and metabolic parameter remission (T2DM, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and MetS) during 4 years in 1,837 morbidly obese patients (females, 85%; age, 42.5 Â± 10.6 years; BMI, 44.0 Â± 5.8) who underwent bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [RYGB], laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy [LSG], and laparoscopic adjustable gastric band [LAGB]). The mean percentage of WL for RYGB, LSG, and LAGB was, respectively, 32.9 Â± 8.7, 29.8 Â± 9.8, and 16.2 Â± 9.6 at 12 months and 30.6 Â± 9.1, 22.7 Â± 10.0, and 15.8 Â± 10.8 at 48 months (p < 0.001), even after adjustment for baseline weight, BMI, age, and sex (p < 0.001). Women had more WL during the first 36 months (p = 0.013 and 0.007 at 12 and 36 months, respectively) and older patients had less WL compared to younger ones (p <0.001), except at 48 months. Patients with T2DM had less WL than those without diabetes after adjustment (sex, age, and surgical technique) during the same period. Patients with hypertension had less WL at 12 months (p = 0.009) and MetS at 24 months (p = 0.020) compared to those without these comorbidities. There was no significant difference regarding the presence of dyslipidemia in WL. The RYGB group showed better results for MetS resolution. During the 4-year follow-up, RYGB was the surgical procedure that caused the highest WL and MetS resolution.",10.1159/000503753,,,,129
1275,Endoscopic dilation of gastrojejunal anastomosis after gastric bypass.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass may result in stenosis of the gastrojejunal anastomosis. There is currently no well-defined management protocol for this complication. Through systematic review, to analyze the results of endoscopic dilation in patients with stenosis, including complication and success rates. The PubMed database was searched for relevant studies published each year from 1988 to 2010, and 23 studies were identified for analysis. Only papers describing the treatment of anastomotic stricture after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were included, and case reports featuring less than three patients were excluded. The mean age of the trial populations was 42.3 years and mean preoperative body mass index was 48.8 kg/mÂ². A total of 1,298 procedures were undertaken in 760 patients (81% female), performing 1.7 dilations per patient. Through-the-scope balloons were used in 16 studies (69.5%) and Savary-Gilliard bougies in four. Only 2% of patients required surgical revision after dilation; the reported complication rate was 2.5% (n=19). Annual success rate was greater than 98% each year from 1992 to 2010, except for a 73% success rate in 2004. Seven studies reported complications, being perforation the most common, reported in 14 patients (1.82%) and requiring immediate operation in two patients. Other complications were also reported: one esophageal hematoma, one Mallory-Weiss tear, one case of severe nausea and vomiting, and two cases of severe abdominal pain. Endoscopic treatment of stenosis is safe and effective; however, further high-quality randomized controlled trials should be conducted to confirm these findings.",10.1590/s0102-67202012000400014,,,,130
340,Computational modelling of self-reported dietary carbohydrate intake on glucose concentrations in patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus one-anastomosis gastric bypass.,"Our aim was to investigate in a real-life setting the use of machine learning for modelling the postprandial glucose concentrations in morbidly obese patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). As part of the prospective randomized open-label trial (RYSA), data from obese (BMI â‰¥35â€‰kg/m2) non-diabetic adult participants were included. Glucose concentrations, measured with FreeStyle Libre, were recorded over 14 preoperative and 14 postoperative days. During these periods, 3-day food intake was self-reported. A machine learning model was applied to estimate glycaemic responses to the reported carbohydrate intakes before and after the bariatric surgeries. Altogether, 10 participants underwent RYGB and 7 participants OAGB surgeries. The glucose concentrations and carbohydrate intakes were reduced postoperatively in both groups. The relative time spent in hypoglycaemia increased regardless of the operation (RYGB, from 9.2 to 28.2%; OAGB, from 1.8 to 37.7%). Postoperatively, we observed an increase in the height of the fitted response curve and a reduction in its width, suggesting that the same amount of carbohydrates caused a larger increase in the postprandial glucose response and that the clearance of the meal-derived blood glucose was faster, with no clinically meaningful differences between the surgeries. A detailed analysis of the glycaemic responses using food diaries has previously been difficult because of the noisy meal data. The utilized machine learning model resolved this by modelling the uncertainty in meal times. Such an approach is likely also applicable in other applications involving dietary data. A marked reduction in overall glycaemia, increase in postprandial glucose response, and rapid glucose clearance from the circulation immediately after surgery are evident after both RYGB and OAGB. Whether nondiabetic individuals would benefit from monitoring the post-surgery hypoglycaemias and the potential to prevent them by dietary means should be investigated.KEY MESSAGESThe use of a novel machine learning model was applicable for combining patient-reported data and time-series data in this clinical study.Marked increase in postprandial glucose concentrations and rapid glucose clearance were observed after both Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and one-anastomosis gastric bypass surgeries.Whether nondiabetic individuals would benefit from monitoring the post-surgery hypoglycaemias and the potential to prevent them by dietary means should be investigated.",10.1080/07853890.2021.1964035,,,,131
1239,Clinical factors associated with weight loss outcomes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.,"Gastric bypass surgery is an effective therapy for extreme obesity. However, substantial variability in weight loss outcomes exists that remains largely unexplained. Our objective was to determine whether any commonly collected preoperative clinical variables were associated with weight loss following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. The analysis was based on a prospectively recruited observational cohort of 2,365 patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery from 2004 to 2009. Weight loss was stratified into three major phases, early (0-6 months), nadir, and long-term (>36 months). Multivariate regression models were constructed using a database of over 350 variables. A total of 12-14 preoperative variables were independently associated (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) with each of the temporal weight loss phases. Preoperative variables associated with poorer nadir and long-term weight loss included higher baseline BMI, higher preoperative weight loss, iron deficiency, use of any diabetes medication, nonuse of bupropion medication, no history of smoking, age >50 years, and the presence of fibrosis on liver biopsy. Several variables previously associated with poorer weight loss after RYGB surgery including age, baseline BMI, and type 2 diabetes were replicated. Several others suggest possible clinical interventions for postoperative management of RYGB patients to improve weight loss outcomes.",10.1002/oby.20529,,,,132
1301,Revisional surgery after failed laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding: a systematic review.,"Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) has emerged as one of the most commonly performed bariatric procedures worldwide. Unfortunately, revisional surgery is required in 20-30 % of cases. Several revisional strategies have been proposed, but there is no consensus regarding the best surgical option. This systematic review was designed to determine which revisional surgery (laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or laparoscopic biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch) is best suited to enhance weight loss following failed LAGB due to complications or inadequate weight loss. EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Clinical Trials were searched using the most comprehensive timeline for each database. A total of 24 relevant articles were identified. Two investigators independently extracted data, and differences were resolved by consensus. The weighted means were calculated for weight loss measurements. A total of 106, 514, and 71 patients underwent conversion from LAGB to laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), and laparoscopic biliopancreatic diversion and duodenal switch (BPDDS), respectively. Before revisional surgery, the weighted mean body mass index (BMI) was 38.8 (6.9), 43.3 (8.1), and 41.3 (7.2) kg/m(2) for the LSG, LRYGB, and BPDDS groups, respectively. The majority of data was reported at 12-24 months follow-up. The mean BMI within this interval was 28 (10.5), 32.2 (6.4), and 33 (5.7) kg/m(2) for the LSG, LRYGB, and BPDDS groups, respectively. In addition, the mean excess weight loss (EWL) was 22 % (2.8), 57.8 % (11.7), 47.1 % (14) for the LSG, LRYGB, and BPDDS groups, respectively. The EWL reached 78.4 % (35) in the BPPDS group after 2-year follow-up. Failed LAGB is best managed with conversion to another bariatric procedure. Stable weight loss occurs with salvage LRYGB. Although results for revisional BPPDS appear promising, additional research, with higher methodological quality, is needed.",10.1007/s00464-012-2510-2,,,,133
1640,Vertical banded gastroplasty-gastric bypass with and without the interposition of jejunum: preliminary report.,"The complications of the gastric pouch in gastric bypass surgery are well known. Since the first report of this surgery 30 years ago, new technical aspects that make it safer and more effective have been implemented. As a modification of gastric bypass, the authors have performed 305 vertical banded gastroplasty-gastric bypass procedures. Two groups of patients underwent the procedure: Group I (n = 206) without a limb of jejunum interposed between the gastric pouch and the excluded stomach, and Group II (n = 99) with a limb of jejunum interposed between the pouch and the stomach. The results regarding excess weight loss and complications of the gastric pouch during the first year after surgery were compared. Age, sex, initial weight, body mass index, and percentage of ideal weight were similar in both groups. Excess weight loss was also similar. The complications in Group I were 1 leak, 3 left subphrenic abscesses, 2 erosive gastritis with bleeding, 1 stenosis of the gastrojejunostomy, 1 perforated ulcer, and 4 marginal ulcers with bleeding. Two patients in Group II developed bleeding from the staple-line. These preliminary data suggest that complications of the gastric pouch can be reduced by interposing a limb of jejunum between the pouch and the excluded stomach. This is an early experience; long-term results are pending.",10.1381/096089299765553692,,,,134
1589,[Patients' assessment of obesity treatment with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery].,"Morbid obesity defined as BMI > or = 40 kg/m2 is associated with serious co-morbidities e.g. hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, respiratory insufficiency, sleep apnea syndrome, estrogen-dependent tumors, and degenerative arthritis. Moreover, general results of lifestyle intervention and/or drug therapy in these patients are less than satisfactory. It is widely believed that obesity surgery including gastric by-pass has proved to be an effective method of achieving maintained body weight reduction. The aim of this study was to investigate change in body weight, prevalence of co-morbidities, and quality of life after Roux-en-Y gastric by-pass surgery. 56 patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in 1999-2001 were asked to answer a 42-question-questionnaire. Complete answers were received from 36 subjects (mean (+/- SD) age 39 +/- 10 years, body weight 127.5 +/- 20.4 kg, BMI 4.40 +/- 5.6 kg/m2). Mean post-surgery follow-up time was 24 months. All patients reported significant weight loss (35.8 +/- 10.7 kg). A statistically significant decrease in prevalence of hypertension and various symptoms associated with cardiovascular disease, respiratory insufficiency, sleep apnea syndrome were noted as well as a significant improvement in quality of life. In morbidly obese patients Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is an effective and long-term well tolerated method of achieving stable weight reduction, leading to improvement in co-morbidities and quality of life.",,,,,135
497,Efficacy of laparoscopic gastric bypass vs laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in treating obesity combined with type-2 diabetes.,"This prospective study compared the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in treating overweight and obese patients with BMI>28Â kg/m2 and type-2 diabetes. Patients were randomized into a gastric bypass group (nÂ =Â 77) or a gastrectomy group (nÂ =Â 80). The surgery time, intraoperative blood loss, recovery time, and hospitalization time were collected. BMI, waistline, hipline, C-peptide level, insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), and their blood and lipid profile were also measured. Surgery time and blood loss were significantly higher in the gastrectomy group, when compared to the gastric bypass group (PÂ <Â 0.05). In both groups, the levels of BMI, waist circumference and hip circumference (but not their ratio) gradually and significantly decreased after surgery compared with baseline (PÂ <Â 0.05), and no significant difference was found between these two groups. The C-peptide level, HOMA-IR, fasting blood glucose, 2-hour postprandial blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin gradually and significantly decreased after surgery compared with the values before treatment (PÂ <Â 0.05). The levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were also lower after surgery in both groups, while HDL and glucagon-like peptide-1 were significantly higher after surgery compared with the values before treatment (PÂ <Â 0.05). However, no significant difference was found between these two groups of patients. Both laparoscopic gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy improved the BMI and diabetic conditions of overweight/obese diabetics, while laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy had a shorter surgical time and less blood loss.",10.1080/09674845.2020.1798578,,,,136
68,Comparison of Sleeve Gastrectomy vs Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) are widely used bariatric procedures for which comparative efficacy and safety remain unclear. To compare perioperative outcomes in SG and RYGB. In this registry-based, multicenter randomized clinical trial (Bypass Equipoise Sleeve Trial), baseline and perioperative data for patients undergoing bariatric surgery from October 6, 2015, to March 31, 2022, were analyzed. Patients were from university, regional, county, and private hospitals in Sweden (nâ€‰=â€‰20) and Norway (nâ€‰=â€‰3). Adults (aged â‰¥18 years) eligible for bariatric surgery with body mass indexes (BMIs; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 35 to 50 were studied. Laparoscopic SG or RYGB. Perioperative complications were analyzed as all adverse events and serious adverse events (Clavien-Dindo grade >IIIb). Ninety-day mortality was also assessed. A total of 1735 of 14â€¯182 eligible patients (12%; 1282 [73.9%] female; mean (SD) age, 42.9 [11.1] years; mean [SD] BMI, 40.8 [3.7]) were included in the study. Patients were randomized and underwent SG (nâ€‰=â€‰878) or RYGB (nâ€‰=â€‰857). The mean (SD) operating time was shorter in those undergoing SG vs RYGB (47 [18] vs 68 [25] minutes; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). The median (IQR) postoperative hospital stay was 1 (1-1) day in both groups. The 30-day readmission rate was 3.1% after SG and 4.0% after RYGB (Pâ€‰=â€‰.33). There was no 90-day mortality. The 30-day incidence of any adverse event was 40 (4.6%) and 54 (6.3%) in the SG and RYGB groups, respectively (odds ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.47-1.08; Pâ€‰=â€‰.11). Corresponding figures for serious adverse events were 15 (1.7%) for the SG group and 23 (2.7%) for the RYGB group (odds ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.33-1.22; Pâ€‰=â€‰.19). This randomized clinical trial of 1735 patients undergoing primary bariatric surgery found that both SG and RYGB were performed with a low perioperative risk without clinically significant differences between groups.

99,"Intraoperative, sociodemographic, and postoperative parameters in individuals undergoing bariatric surgery.","This study aimed to comparatively analyze sociodemographic data and postoperative parameters of patients undergoing bypass and sleeve surgeries in a private hospital in SÃ£o LuÃ­s, MA. The study was descriptive, prospective, observational, and comparative, with a quantitative approach between August 2020 and July 2021. We analyzed 74 participants of both genders, aged between 18 and 70 years, with 31 undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery and 43 undergoing sleeve gastrectomy surgery. In the postoperative period, sociodemographic characteristics, surgery and anesthesia duration, pain levels, adverse effects, weight loss, and complications from the surgical procedure were analyzed. Males predominated in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and females in sleeve gastrectomy surgery. Clinical characteristics regarding self-declared ethnicity, age and place of birth, education, and marital status were similar between the studied groups. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass had an average surgery time of 112.14Â±10.06 min and sleeve gastrectomy 91.11Â±23.69 min, with a significant difference (p<0.001). Regarding anesthesia time, gastric bypass averaged 160.36Â±13.99 min and sleeve gastrectomy 154.88Â±29.10 min, with no statistical difference between groups (p=0.335). Nausea, vomiting, and drowsiness were more common in Sleeve gastrectomy, with no significant difference (p=0.562). Roux-en-Y gastric bypass showed a higher rate of weight loss from 1 month after surgery (14.2Â±4.15) and more variation in body mass index within 3 months after surgery (32.17Â±4.76). Complications occurred in a small number of patients. The two surgical techniques proved effective in delivering the best results for patients, with the group undergoing bypass showing statistically significant weight loss from 1 month after the surgical procedure.",10.1590/1806-9282.20230535,,,,138
618,Increase in Protein Intake After 3Â Months of RYGB Is an Independent Predictor for the Remission of Obesity in the First Year of Surgery.,"Although bariatric surgery promotes dietary changes, many questions regarding their effect on weight loss remain unanswered. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in dietary intake and predictive factors of obesity remission in the first 12Â months after RYGB. Fifty-one patients (mean 39.34â€‰Â±â€‰9.38Â years, 68.7% women) who underwent RYGB were included in this study. Dietary intake was evaluated through a 24-h dietary recall and subsequently classified by NOVA, macronutrients and calories. The predictive factors for obesity remission within 12Â months after RYGB were evaluated by Cox regression. At baseline, 62.7% of the patients presented severe obesity; mean excess weight loss was greater than 80% after 1Â year of surgery and about 70% of the patients were no longer diagnosed with obesity. An increase in percentage of calories from protein was observed at 3 and 12Â months after surgery. The caloric contribution of ultra-processed foods was low at 3Â months after surgery while that of unprocessed or minimally processed foods was high at 3 and 12Â months after surgery. From the Cox regression analysis, preoperative BMI (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.69-0.88) and age (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89-0.99) showed an inverse association with obesity remission. Also, Î” protein (at 3Â months-baseline) showed a positive association with obesity remission (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12). Lower preoperative BMI, lower age, and higher protein intake at 3Â months after surgery may favor remission of obesity in up to 12Â months compared with baseline.",10.1007/s11695-019-04124-8,,,,139
1210,Comparison of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity or type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is one of the most widely used bariatric procedures, and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) as a single-stage procedure for treating morbid obesity is becoming more popular. We compared both techniques to evaluate their efficacy in treating morbid obesity or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register databases, Medline, Embase, ISI databases and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of LRYGB and LSG for morbid obesity or T2DM published in any language. Statistical analyses were carried out using RevMan software. Five worldwide RCTs with 196 patients in the LRYGB group and 200 in the LSG group were included in our analysis. Compared with patients who had LSG, those who had LRYGB had a higher remission rate of T2MD, lost more weight and had lower low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, homeostasis model assessment index and insulin levels. There was no difference in the reoperation rate between the groups. However, patients treated with LRYGB had a higher incidence of complication than those treated with LSG. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that LRYGB is more effective than LSG for the surgical treatment of T2DM and control of metabolic syndrome. However, LSG is safer and has a reduced rate of complications. Further high-quality RCTs with long follow-up periods are needed to provide more reliable evidence.",10.1503/cjs.026912,,,,140
679,Long-term outcomes of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity: Results from a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) are 2 widely used procedures performed in bariatric surgery. However, their long-term weight loss effects have not been well compared. To evaluate the long-term outcome of 2 procedures for treating morbid obesity. The gastrointestinal surgery center, Eastern Hospital, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital. Three electronic databases, PubMed, CNKI, and EMBASE, were searched ending in September 2018. Eligible studies were prospective randomized controlled trials. Of 15 randomized controlled trials studies, 1381 cases were included, 697 were randomly divided into the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy group and 684 to the LRYGB group. A statistically significant percent excess weight loss reduction in weighted mean difference was observed in LRYGB group at 5 years (weighted mean differenceâ€¯=â€¯-8.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]â€¯=â€¯-13.08 to -4.73, P < .0001), and at 3 years (weighted mean differenceâ€¯=â€¯-11.96, 95% CIâ€¯=â€¯-17.62 to -6.30, P < .0001). However, there was not any statistically difference between the 2 procedures in <3 years. The total complication of the LSC group were less than that of the LRYGB groups (odds ratioâ€¯=â€¯.52, 95%CIâ€¯=â€¯.35-.76, Pâ€¯=â€¯.0007). This meta-analysis showed that the LRYGB procedure could reduce gastrointestinal reflux disease (odds ratioâ€¯=â€¯.26, 95%CIâ€¯=â€¯.11-.61, Pâ€¯=â€¯.002); however, no statistically significant differences were found in type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and sleep apnea. This meta-analysis showed that significantly greater in percent excess weight loss after 5 years of LRYGB treatment; however, it seems to have a higher incidence of total complications.",10.1016/j.soard.2019.02.001,,,,141
1518,Prospective randomized trial of banded versus nonbanded gastric bypass for the super obese: early results.,"Banded gastric bypass has been reported to result in superior weight loss compared with standard nonbanded gastric bypass. However, an adequate comparison of these procedures has not yet been reported. A total of 90 patients were enrolled in this prospective randomized double-blind trial comparing banded and nonbanded open gastric bypass for the treatment of super obesity. The banding technique involved placement of a 1.5 x 5.5-cm polypropylene band around the proximal gastric pouch of a standard gastric bypass procedure using the technique of Capella. Chi-square testing and analysis of variance were performed to find any differences in patient characteristics (gender, age, and initial body mass index), percentage of excess weight lost at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months postoperatively, improvement or resolution of co-morbidities, and complications in the banded versus nonbanded gastric bypass groups. As expected, no differences were present in the patient characteristics or incidence of co-morbidities between the banded (n = 46) and nonbanded (n = 44) groups. The body mass index, percentage of women, and mean age was 59.5 and 56.5 kg/m2, 64% and 73.8% (P = .09), and 40.6 +/- 7.4 and 42.6 +/- 7.2 years for the banded and nonbanded groups, respectively; all differences were nonsignificant. No significant differences were found in the resolution of co-morbidities. No significant difference was present in the percentage of excess weight loss at 6, 12, and 24 months (43.1% versus 24.7%, 64.0% versus 57.4%, and 64.2% versus 57.2%, respectively) postoperatively; however, the banded patients had achieved a significantly greater percentage of excess weight loss at 36 months (73.4% versus 57.7%; P <.05). The incidence of intolerance to meat and bread was greater in the banded patients. The overall number of complications was 12 (26%) in the banded and 13 (29.5%) in the nonbanded group, a nonsignficant difference. No band erosions had occurred at the last follow-up visit, and no patients in either group died. These results suggest that although the initial weight loss was not significantly different between the 2 groups, the banded patients continued to lose weight for < or = 3 years. The polypropylene band appeared to be well tolerated. We plan longer follow-up to confirm the possibility of additional weight loss and the prevention of weight regain in the banded group, as well as to document any long-term band complications.",10.1016/j.soard.2007.01.010,,,,142
1415,The effects of laparoscopic vs. open gastric bypass for morbid obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the effects of laparoscopic vs. open gastric bypass for morbid obesity. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken to assess randomized controlled trials on laparoscopic and open gastric bypass for morbid obesity. Six randomized controlled trials involving a total of 422 patients were included. There were 214 patients in the laparoscopic group and 208 patients in the open group separately. Compared with open surgery, laparoscopic surgery for morbid obesity could significantly shorten hospital stays (WMD=-1.11 d, 95% confidence interval [CI][-1.65, -0.56]). However, laparoscopic surgery for morbid obesity showed higher re-operation (RR=4.82, 95% CI [1.29, 17.98]) and longer surgical time (WMD=28.00 min, 95% CI [7.84, 48.16]). There were no statistical differences in complication (RR=0.84, 95% CI [0.64, 1.10]) and weight loss (WMD=1.00 kg m(-2), 95% CI [-0.79, 2.79]). The effects of laparoscopic and open gastric bypass for morbid obesity were basically the same except that laparoscopic had a shorter hospital stay and open surgery had a rate of fewer re-operations and shorter surgical time. Further high-quality, long follow-up period randomized controlled trials should be carried out to provide more reliable evidence.",10.1111/j.1467-789X.2010.00757.x,,,,143
517,Weight regain after bariatric surgery: a systematic literature review and comparison across studies using a large reference sample.,"Published estimates of weight regain (WR) after bariatric surgery vary greatly. Understanding the sources of variability in the literature and clarifying the magnitude of WR after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are critical for informing expectations and planning interventions. A literature search through January 2019 yielded 15 English-language studies that reported WR in at least 30 participants, not selected based on weight loss or WR, at least 3 years after primary RYGB (n = 11) or SG (n = 5). Median follow-up was 5.0 (range, 3.2-10.0) years. Median sample size was 62 (range, 33-464). Samples represented a median of 54.3% (range, 10.7%-100%) of eligible participants. Nadir weight was determined by serial research assessments (n = 1), medical records (n = 7), participant recall (n = 4), or an undisclosed method (n = 4). Three continuous and 8 binary WR measures (the latter, based on various thresholds for clinically meaningful WR) were reported. To enable comparison across studies, the percentage difference in WR in each study versus a reference sample (n = 1433 RYGB), matched on time since surgery and WR measure, was calculated. Median WR in the reference sample increased from 8.2 (25th-75th percentile: 0-19.5) to 23.8 (25th-75th percentile: 9.0-33.9) percent of maximum weight lost, 3 to 6 years post RYGB surgery. Studies of RYGB versus SG, with larger versus smaller samples, with higher versus lower participation rates, that determined nadir weight via participant recall versus medical records, and reported continuous versus binary WR measures tended to have WR values closer to the reference sample and each other. Variation in WR estimates was explained by heterogeneity in WR measures, timing of assessment, surgical procedure, and study design characteristics. The best estimate of WR after RYGB likely comes from the large reference sample. WR after SG versus RYGB appears higher. However, additional high-quality studies with uniform reporting of WR by surgical procedure are needed.",10.1016/j.soard.2020.03.034,,,,144
343,Endoscopic revision of gastrojejunal anastomosis for the treatment of dumping syndrome in patients with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Dumping syndrome is a known complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Recently, endoscopic gastrojejunal anastomosis (GJA) revision has been employed as a treatment option. The primary aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis for the role of endoscopic GJA revision in patients with RYGB for the treatment of dumping syndrome. Search strategies were developed for PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases from inception through December 2020 in accordance with PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Pooled proportions with rates estimated using random effects models were used. Outcomes included pooled technical success, clinical success, adverse events, and rate of reintervention. Heterogeneity was assessed with I2 statistics and publication bias by funnel plot using Egger and Begg tests. Six studies (nâ€‰=â€‰263 patients; 60.25% female) were included (1 prospective and 5 retrospective). Mean age was 46.27â€‰Â±â€‰2.54Â years. Average patient weight was 95.59â€‰Â±â€‰4.78Â kg, BMI of 41.43â€‰Â±â€‰3.07Â kg/m2, and pre-procedure GJA size of 32.23â€‰Â±â€‰8.68Â mm. Pooled technical and clinical success was 98.15% and 89.5%. Among studies reporting Sigstad scores, endoscopic GJA revision resulted in a significant improvement [mean Sigstad score difference of -Â 9.96 (95% CI, -Â 19.951 to -Â 0.975); Pâ€‰<â€‰0.03]. Mean procedure time was 37.12â€‰Â±â€‰10.40Â min with an intra-procedural adverse event rate of 2.42%. Over a mean follow-up of 8.03â€‰Â±â€‰6.87Â months, post-procedure adverse events occurred in 2.96% of patients with a reintervention rate of 11.54%. This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that endoscopic GJA revision appears an effective and safe treatment for dumping syndrome.",10.1007/s00464-021-08731-4,,,,145
1632,Bariatric surgery for morbid obesity.,"Bariatric surgery is a treatment for severely obese patients. We examined the efficacy of bariatric surgery, addressing three questions: 1) What is the overall weight reduction following bariatric surgery? 2) What complications are associated with bariatric surgery? 3) What impact does weight loss have on obesity-related comorbidity? Fixed and random effects meta-analyses were used to determine the amount of weight reduction following bariatric surgery. The influence of a variety of co-variates that could affect study results was examined. Information from evidence-based sources was used to explore the impact of weight loss on comorbidities. Meta-analyses results were affected by loss to follow-up, and within-study heterogeneity of variance. Therefore, results were pooled from studies with complete patient follow-up. Meta-analysis of six studies reporting weight loss at 1 year and four studies with mean follow-up of 9 months to 7 years demonstrated BMI reductions of 16.4 kg/m(2) and 13.3 kg/m(2), respectively. Weight reduction following bariatric surgery may be associated with improvements in risk factors for cardiac disease including hypertension, type 2 diabetes and lipid abnormalities, and may decrease the severity of obstructive sleep apnea. Bariatric surgery is appropriate for obese patients (BMI >40 kg/m(2) or > or =35 kg/m(2) with obesity-related comorbidity) in whom non-surgical treatment options were unsuccessful. Additional research is needed to examine the long-term benefits of weight loss following bariatric surgery, particularly with respect to obesity-related comorbidities.",10.1381/096089200321594246,,,,146
516,Outcome of revisional bariatric surgery for insufficient weight loss after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: an observational study.,"Insufficient weight loss or secondary weight regain with or without recurrence of comorbidity can occur years after laparoscopic Roux en Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). In selected patients, increasing restriction or adding malabsorption may be a surgical option after conservative measures failed. Evaluation of short and long term results of revisional surgery for insufficient weight loss or weight regain after LRYGB. Tertiary hospital. Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from a cohort of 1150 LRYGB patients. Included were patients, who underwent revisional bariatric surgery after LRYGB for insufficient weight loss with a follow-up of minimal 1 year. Fifty-four patients were included in the analysis. After an interdisciplinary evaluation, patients with insufficient weight loss, signs of dumping syndrome, and lacking restriction were offered a nonadjustable band around the pouch (banded group, n = 34) and patients with sufficient restriction, excellent compliance, and adherence were offered a revision to laparoscopic biliopancreatic diversion (BPD group, n = 20). The revisional procedure was performed 3.3 Â± 2.3 years after LRYGB in the banded-group and after 6.4 Â± 4.3 years in the BPD group (P = .001). Mean body mass index at the time of the primary bariatric procedure was 41.7 Â± 6.2 kg/m2 in the banded group and 45.2 Â± 8.2 kg/m2 in the BPD group (P = .08); minimal body mass index between both operations was 29.1 Â± 4.7 kg/m2 in the banded group and 36.5 Â± 9.4 kg/m2 in the BPD group, and, at the time of revisional surgery, 31.4 Â± 5.5 kg/m2 in the banded group and 40.8 Â± 6.7 kg/m2 in the BPD group (P = .0001). The mean body mass index difference 1 year after revisional surgery was 1.3 Â± 3.0 kg/m2 in the banded group and 6.7 Â± 4.5 kg/m2 in the BPD group (P = .01). In the banded group, 11 patients (32.4%) needed removal of the band, 4 patients (11.8%) needed an adjustment, and 4 patients (11.8%) were later converted to BPD. In the BPD group, 2 (10.0%) patients needed revision for severe protein malabsorption. Insufficient weight loss or secondary weight regain after LRYGB is a rare indication for revisional surgery. Banded bypass has modest results for additional weight loss but can help patients suffering from dumping. In very carefully selected cases, BPD can achieve additional weight loss with acceptable complication rate but higher risk for reoperation. Future ""adjuvant medical treatments,"" such as glucagon-like peptide 1 analogues and other pharmacologic treatment options could be an alternative for achievingÂ additional weight loss and better metabolic response.",10.1016/j.soard.2020.04.009,,,,147
1520,Outcome and complications after laparoscopic Swedish adjustable gastric banding: 5-year results of a prospective clinical trial.,"Bariatric surgery is currently the only effective treatment for morbid obesity in terms of inducing and maintaining satisfactory weight loss and decreasing weight-related co-morbidities. A study was conducted to assess the effects, complications and outcome after laparoscopic Swedish adjustable gastric banding (SAGB) to 5 years. Between June 1998 and December 2005, all patients with implantation of a SAGB were enrolled in a prospective clinical trial. Results were recorded and classified, with special regard to long-term complications and re-operation rate. SAGB was performed in 128 patients (87 female, 41 male). Mean age was 40.2 +/- 5.3 years, with mean preoperative BMI 44.5 +/- 3.9 kg/m2. Overall mortality was 0%. Patient follow-up was 94.5%. BMI after 1, 2 and 5 years was 35.7 +/- 3.7 kg/m2 (P < 0.005), 33.7 +/- 3.8 kg/m2 (P < 0.001) and 31.8 +/- 3.8 kg/m2 (P < 0.001), respectively. Mean EWL after 1, 2 and 5 years was 33.3 +/- 6.8% (P < 0.005), 45.5 +/- 6.4% (P < 0.001) and 57.4 +/- 6.5% (P < 0.001), respectively. The nonresponder rate (EWL < 30%) after 2 and 5 years was 17.0% and 6.8%, respectively. The early complication rate (< 30 d) was 6.25% (8/128), with 5 minor and 3 major complications. Late complications (> 30 d) occurred in 10.9% (14/128), of whom 2 were minor and 12 were major complications. The overall re-operation rate was 11.7% (15/128). At 5-year follow-up, laparoscopic SAGB is a safe and effective surgical treatment for morbid obesity. Our results appear to confirm that SAGB is a safer surgical treatment regarding rate and severity of complications compared with gastric bypass and malabsorptive procedures.",10.1007/s11695-007-9034-1,,,,148
975,Durability of Addition of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass to Lifestyle Intervention and Medical Management in Achieving Primary Treatment Goals for Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes in Mild to Moderate Obesity: A Randomized Control Trial.,"We compared 3-year achievement of an American Diabetes Association composite treatment goal (HbA1c <7.0%, LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dL, and systolic blood pressure <130 mmHg) after 2 years of intensive lifestyle-medical management intervention, with and without Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, with one additional year of usual care. A total of 120 adult participants, with BMI 30.0-39.9 kg/m(2) and HbA1c â‰¥8.0%, were randomized 1:1 to two treatment arms at three clinical sites in the U.S. and one in Taiwan. All patients received the lifestyle-medical management intervention for 24 months; half were randomized to also receive gastric bypass. At 36 months, the triple end point goal was met in 9% of lifestyle-medical management patients and 28% of gastric bypass patients (P = 0.01): 10% and 19% lower than at 12 months. Mean (SD) HbA1c values at 3 years were 8.6% (3.5) and 6.7% (2.0) (P < 0.001). No lifestyle-medical management patient had remission of diabetes at 36 months, whereas 17% of gastric bypass patients had full remission and 19% had partial remission. Lifestyle-medical management patients used more medications than gastric bypass patients: mean (SD) 3.8 (3.3) vs. 1.8 (2.4). Percent weight loss was mean (SD) 6.3% (16.1) in lifestyle-medical management vs. 21.0% (14.5) in gastric bypass (P < 0.001). Over 3 years, 24 serious or clinically significant adverse events were observed in lifestyle-medical management vs. 51 with gastric bypass. Gastric bypass is more effective than lifestyle-medical management intervention in achieving diabetes treatment goals, mainly by improved glycemic control. However, the effect of surgery diminishes with time and is associated with more adverse events.",10.2337/dc15-2481,,,,149
1359,Late marginal ulcers after gastric bypass for morbid obesity. Clinical and endoscopic findings and response to treatment.,"Marginal ulcer (MU) is an occasional complication after gastric bypass which can occur early or late after surgery. In this study, we evaluated the incidence, clinical presentation, and endoscopic behavior of patients with late MU. Five hundred fifty morbidly obese patients were evaluated prospectively performing an endoscopic study 1-8 years after surgery. They were submitted either to laparotomic (nâ€‰=â€‰392) or laparoscopic (nâ€‰=â€‰158) approach. Six patients (1%) presented late MU 12 to 84 months after surgery. Four patients had single ulcer, while two patients had multiple ulcers. All were treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Several endoscopic evaluations were performed in each patient showing healing and no recurrence of the ulcer. Late MU occurs in a small proportion (1%) of patients submitted to gastric bypass. It can be single or multiple. Medical treatment with PPIs achieves healing at a mean time of 7 months. Several endoscopic evaluations should be performed in these patients in order to demonstrate healing of the ulcer and no recurrence.",10.1007/s11695-011-0429-7,,,,150
1375,Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus in Chinese patients with body mass index of 25-35.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) can dramatically ameliorate type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in morbidly obese patients. However, there is little evidence supporting the effectiveness of LRYGB in low body mass index (BMI) patients. The study was designed to evaluate the safety and results of LRYGB for achieving T2DM remission in patients with BMI in the range of 25-35 kg/m(2). Twenty-two patients (two men and 20 women) with T2DM underwent LRYGB. Data on patient demographics, BMI, co-morbidities, and details of diabetes mellitus, including disease duration, family history, medication use, and remission, were prospectively collected and analyzed. The mean age was 47 years (range, 28-63 years), mean BMI was 30.81 (range, 25.00-34.80 kg/m(2)), and mean duration of T2DM onset was 6.57 years (range, 1-20 years). Sixteen (72.27%) patients had a family history of T2DM. There was no mortality, but two (9%) patients experienced complications: an early gastrojejunostomy hemorrhage and frequent loose stools that required revision surgery. At 12 months, 14 (63.6%) patients showed T2DM remission, six (27.3%) showed glycemic control, and two (9.1%) showed improvement. The group achieving remission had a higher BMI (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001), younger age (pâ€‰=â€‰0.002), and shorter duration of diabetes (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001). These three factors may be predictors of diabetes resolution at 12 months. Early intervention in low-BMI patients yields better remission rates because age, BMI, and duration of T2DM predict glycemic outcomes.",10.1007/s11695-011-0408-z,,,,151
1100,Five-year outcomes after laparoscopic gastric bypass and laparoscopic duodenal switch in patients with body mass index of 50 to 60: a randomized clinical trial.,"There is no consensus as to which bariatric procedure is preferred to reduce weight and improve health in patients with a body mass index higher than 50. To compare 5-year outcomes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (gastric bypass) and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (duodenal switch). Randomized clinical open-label trial at Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway, and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. Participants were recruited between March 17, 2006, and August 20, 2007, and included 60 patients aged 20 to 50 years with a body mass index of 50 to 60. The current study provides the 5-year follow-up analyses by intent to treat, excluding one participant accepted for inclusion who declined being operated on prior to knowing to what group he was randomized. Laparoscopic gastric bypass and laparoscopic duodenal switch. Body mass index and secondary outcomes including anthropometric measures, cardiometabolic risk factors, pulmonary function, vitamin status, gastrointestinal symptoms, health-related quality of life, and adverse events. Sixty patients were randomly assigned and operated on with gastric bypass (nâ€‰=â€‰31) and duodenal switch (nâ€‰=â€‰29). Fifty-five patients (92%) completed the study. Five years after surgery, the mean reductions in body mass index were 13.6 (95% CI, 11.0-16.1) and 22.1 (95% CI, 19.5-24.7) after gastric bypass and duodenal switch, respectively. The mean between-group difference was 8.5 (95% CI, 4.9-12.2; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). Remission rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome and changes in blood pressure and lung function were similar between groups. Reductions in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting glucose were significantly greater after duodenal switch compared with gastric bypass. Serum concentrations of vitamin A and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were significantly reduced after duodenal switch compared with gastric bypass. Duodenal switch was associated with more gastrointestinal adverse effects. Health-related quality of life was similar between groups. Patients with duodenal switch underwent more surgical procedures related to the initial procedure (13 [44.8%] vs 3 [9.7%] patients; Pâ€‰=â€‰.002) and had significantly more hospital admissions compared with patients with gastric bypass. In patients with a body mass index of 50 to 60, duodenal switch resulted in greater weight loss and greater improvements in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucose levels 5 years after surgery compared with gastric bypass while improvements in health-related quality of life were similar. However, duodenal switch was associated with more surgical, nutritional, and gastrointestinal adverse effects. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00327912.",10.1001/jamasurg.2014.3579,,,,152
1506,Italian multicenter experience of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on vertical banded gastroplasty: four-year results of effective and safe innovative procedure enabling traditional endoscopic and radiographic study of bypassed stomach and biliary tract.,"Cancer, perforation, and bleeding in the bypassed stomach after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) are rare, but serious, complications that need an early diagnosis. Our goal was to perform gastric bypass such that traditional endoscopic and radiographic study of the gastric remnant would be possible and, at the same time, obtain results in terms of weight loss equivalent to those found after standard RYGB. A previously published study demonstrated that complete occlusion of the gastrogastric outlet was not necessary to lose weight. We have developed an open RYGB-on-vertical banded gastroplasty procedure. Since 2002, 289 patients with a mean age of 40.1 +/- 14.8 years, mean body mass index of 51.4 +/- 7.3 kg/m(2), and mean percentage of excess body weight of 107.3% +/- 36.7% underwent RYGB-on-vertical banded gastroplasty as their primary procedure. The follow-up examinations included radiographic and, if necessary, endoscopic studies at 6 and 12 months postoperatively and annually thereafter. Two cases of anastomotic ulcer were detected, one of which involved band erosion. The percentage of excess weight loss was 48.2% +/- 18.8% after 6 months and 59.0% +/-17.7%, 63.3% +/- 13.9%, 66.9% +/- 17.5%, and 70.0% +/- 17.7% after 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively. The weight loss curve was similar to that for standard RYGB. The results of our study have shown that RYGB-on-vertical banded gastroplasty is as effective as traditional RYGB, while allowing for traditional radiography of the bypassed stomach in every patient. Endoscopy of the distal stomach and, therefore, the biliary tract, was also possible. These are the fundamental aspects of the procedure.",10.1016/j.soard.2007.09.013,,,,153
252,Effect of exercise training after bariatric surgery: A 5-year follow-up study of a randomized controlled trial.,"We previously showed in a 6-month randomized controlled trial that resistance training and protein supplementation after bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, RYGB) improved muscle strength without significant effect on weight loss and body composition changes. We performed a 5-year follow-up study in these subjects with the aim 1) to assess the long-term effect of this exercise training intervention and 2) to analyze associations between habitual physical activity (PA) and weight regain at 5 years. Fifty-four out of 76 initial participants (follow-up rate of 71%) completed the 5-year follow-up examination (controls, n = 17; protein supplementation, n = 22; protein supplementation and resistance training, n = 15). We measured body weight and composition (DXA), lower-limb strength (leg-press one-repetition maximum) and habitual PA (Actigraph accelerometers and self-report). Weight regain at 5 years was considered low when <10% of 12-month weight loss. Mean (SD) time elapse since RYGB was 5.7 (0.9) y. At 5 years, weight loss was 32.8 (10.1) kg, with a mean weight regain of 5.4 (SD 5.9) kg compared with the 12-month assessment. Moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) assessed by accelerometry did not change significantly compared with pre-surgery values (+5.2 [SD 21.7] min/d, P = 0.059), and only 4 (8.2%) patients reported participation in resistance training. Muscle strength decreased over time (overall mean [SD]: -49.9 [53.5] kg, respectively, P<0.001), with no statistically significant difference between exercise training intervention groups. An interquartile increase in MVPA levels was positively associated with lower weight regain (OR [95% CI]: 3.27 [1.41;9.86]). Early postoperative participation in a resistance training protocol after bariatric surgery was not associated with improved muscle strength after 5 years of follow-up; however, increasing physical activity of at least moderate intensity may promote weight maintenance after surgery. PA may therefore play an important role in the long-term management of patients with obesity after undergoing bariatric procedure.",10.1371/journal.pone.0271561,,,,154
1566,[Bariatric surgery: 10-year results of the Swedish Obese Subjects Study].,"The 10-year results of the prospective, controlled Swedish Obese Subjects Study were recently reported in the New England Journal of Medicine by L. SjÃ¶strÃ¶m and colleagues. This trial compared obese subjects who underwent gastric surgery and contemporaneously matched, conventionally treated obese control subjects. The follow-up rate for laboratory examinations was 74.5 percent at 10 years. At that time, data of 627 patients of the control group (mean age of 48 years, body mass index of 41 kg/m2) were compared to those of 641 patients who were submitted to surgery (banding n = 156, vertical banded gastroplasty n = 451 and gastric bypass n =34). At 10 years, the body weight had increased by 1.6 percent in the control group and decreased by 16.1 percent in the surgery group (p < 0.001), and similar changes were observed for waist circumference (+2.8 percent versus -10.1 percent, respectively, p < 0.001). Energy intake was lower and the proportion of physically active subjects higher in the surgery group than in the control group throughout the observation period. Ten-year rates of recovery from diabetes, hypertriglyceridaemia, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertension, and hyperuricaemia were more favourable in the surgery than in the control group. The surgery group had lower 10-year incidence rates of diabetes, hypertriglyceridaemia, and hyperuricaemia (but not of hypertension) than the control group. In conclusion, as compared with conventional therapy, bariatric surgery appears to be a valuable option for the treatment of severe obesity, resulting in long-term weight loss, improved lifestyle, and, except for hypercholesterolaemia that was not significantly affected, amelioration in cardiovascular risk factors that were elevated at baseline. Obtaining long-term data concerning the effect of weight loss on overall mortality and on the incidence rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cancer remains a key-objective of this landmark study.",,,,,155
599,A Comparison of the Effects of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy on Body Mass Composition as Measured by Air Displacement Plethysmography.,"The laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is now the most commonly performed bariatric surgery in the world. Multiple studies have demonstrated the equivalence between the LSG and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) with regard to weight loss and comorbidity resolution. Few studies have examined the differences in body mass composition change between the two procedures. Sixty-three patients undergoing either LSG or RYGB underwent calculation of total body mass, ideal body mass, lean mass, and fat mass by air displacement plethysmography (BodPodtm) prior to surgery and at 12Â months postoperatively. Calculations of excess body weight, % excess weight loss, change in % fat mass, and change in % lean mass were then performed at each time interval. Thirty-three patients underwent LSG and 30 patients underwent RYGB. Mean percent excess weight loss in the LSG and RYGB group was 47.2% and 53.4% respectively (pâ€‰=â€‰0.165, 95% CI -â€‰14.8-2.6). Mean percent change in fat mass for the LSG group and RYGB group was 9.2% and 10.51% respectively (pâ€‰=â€‰0.249, 95% CI -â€‰0.86-3.2). Mean percent change in lean mass for the LSG group and RYGB group was 9.4% and 10.49% respectively (pâ€‰=â€‰0.383, 95% CI 2.85-1.13). The LSG and RYGB both impart dramatic meaningful loss in excess body weight. In addition, both the LSG and RYGB impart dramatic reductions in fat mass. However, both procedures induce loss of lean mass and there appears to be no difference between the two procedures in this regard despite their anatomic and physiologic differences.",10.1007/s11695-019-04178-8,,,,156
732,Whether a Short or Long Alimentary Limb Influences Weight Loss in Gastric Bypass: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, the most commonly performed procedure in bariatric surgery, still lacks a consensus on whether alimentary limb length (ALL) influences weight loss. Studies were identified by searching multiple electronic databases. Studies with enough data including body mass index (BMI) loss and percent excess weight loss (% EWL) were eligible. The statistical analysis was performed with Stata 14.0. In total, eight studies with 1714 patients were included. The meta-analysis suggested that short ALLs weakened the efficacy of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in terms of BMI loss (standard mean deviation (SMD), -â€‰0.33 [95% confidence intervals (CI), -â€‰0.60, -â€‰0.05], pâ€‰=â€‰0.021) with 3Â years of follow-up and % EWL (SMD, -â€‰0.17 [95% CI, -â€‰0.31, -â€‰0.04], pâ€‰=â€‰0.013) with 2Â years of follow-up. The subgroup analysis demonstrated that the group with a BMI â‰¥â€‰50Â kg/m2 had a significant SMD between the use of short and the standard ALLs (-â€‰0.71 [95% CI, -â€‰1.07, -â€‰0.35], pâ€‰=â€‰0.000), while the subgroup with a BMI <â€‰50Â kg/m2 (SMD, -â€‰0.29 [95% CI, -â€‰0.78, 0.20], pâ€‰=â€‰0.247) did not. Compared with a standard ALL (130-150Â cm), a short ALL (40-100Â cm) may reduce the efficacy of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, while a long ALL (170-250Â cm) did not significantly improve the effects in terms of BMI loss and % EWL. In addition, a potential view of the meta-analysis indicated patients with a BMI <â€‰50Â kg/m2 might get more benefits with a short ALL, while those patients with a BMI â‰¥â€‰50Â kg/m2 might benefit more from a standard ALL.",10.1007/s11695-018-3475-6,,,,157
79,Boosting weight loss after conversional Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass with liraglutide and placebo use. A double-blind-randomized controlled trial.,"Conversional bariatric surgery inherently has less weight loss (WL) compared to primary procedures. Adjunctive use of the GLP-1 analog, liraglutide with conversional Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (cRYGB) may maximize the WL benefits of surgery. This single-center randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial included 80 patients randomized into two groups; the liraglutide group (40 patients) who received daily injections of liraglutide, and the placebo group (40 patients) who received normal saline starting at 6 weeks from cRYGB and continued for 6 months. After discontinuing the drugs at 6 months and unblinding, the patient were followed up to 12 months. The endpoints were percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) and percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL), and changes in the metabolic biomarkers, and complications within 30 and 90 days according to the global outcome benchmark (GOB) stratification. In total, 38 patients in the liraglutide group and 31 in the placebo group completed the 24 weeks. Liraglutide group experienced better WL with a significantly higher mean %TWL at 1 month (10.27Â±1.39 vs. 8.41Â±2.08), at 6 weeks (12.65Â±1.77 vs. 10.47Â±2.23), at 6 months (18.29 Â±1.74 vs. 15.58 Â±1.65), and at 12 months 24.15Â±2.35 versus 22.70Â±2.13 (all P <0.001). For %EWL, this was also significantly higher in the liraglutide group at all time points. A %TWL of greater than 20% at 6 months of treatment was recorded in six (15.8%) patients in the liraglutide group and none in the placebo group ( P =0.029). Both groups had comparable changes in metabolic biomarkers. Adverse events were recorded in 11 (27.5%) patients in the liraglutide, with no adverse events in the placebo group ( P <0.001). Both groups had Clavien-Dindo scores I and II (5.0 and 2.5%), and GOB values indicated that 90.0 and 97.5% were low-risk patients. Adjunctive use of liraglutide with cRYGB gives significantly higher WL and resolution of associated medical problems.",10.1097/JS9.0000000000000990,,,,158
1558,Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding versus open vertical banded gastroplasty: a prospective randomized trial.,"Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) and open vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) are treatment modalities for morbid obesity. However, few prospective randomized clinical trials (RCT) have been performed to compare both operations. 100 patients (50 per group) were included in the study. Postoperative outcomes included hospital length of stay (LOS), complications, percent excess weight loss (%EWL), BMI and reduction in total comorbidities. Follow-up in all patients was 2 years. LOS was significantly shorter in the LAGB group. 3 LAGB were converted to open (1 to gastric bypass). Directly after VBG, 3 patients needed relaparotomies due to leakage, of which one (2%) died. After 2 years, 100% follow-up was achieved. BMI and %EWL were significantly decreased in both groups but significantly more in the VBG group compared to the LAGB group (31.0 kg/m2 and 70.1% vs 34.6 and 54.9% respectively). Co-morbidities significantly decreased in both groups in time. 2 years after LAGB, 20 patients needed reoperation for pouch dilation/slippage (n=12), band leakage (n=2), band erosion (n=2) and access-port problems (n=4). In the VBG group, 18 patients needed revisional surgery due to staple-line disruption (n=15), narrow outlet (n=2) or insufficient weight loss (n=1). Furthermore, 8 VBG patients developed an incisional hernia. This RCT demonstrates that, despite the initial better weight loss in the VBG group, based on complication rates and clinical outcome, LAGB is preferred. It had a shorter LOS and less postoperative morbidity.",10.1381/096089205774512456,,,,159
1293,Roux-en-Y gastric bypass stands the test of time: 5-year results in low body mass index (30-35 kg/m(2)) Indian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Our objective was to evaluate the long-term results of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on excess weight loss, remission of the metabolic syndrome, and complications in Indian patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with a body mass index of 30-35 kg/m(2). The setting was a corporate hospital in Mumbai, India. The present prospective observational study was begun in January 2006. A total of 52 patients with uncontrolled T2DM and a body mass index of 30-35 kg/m(2) elected to undergo laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The duration of T2DM was 3.5-14.5 years (median 8.4). Of the 52 patients, 61.5% had hypertension and 59.6% had dyslipidemia. Remission of T2DM and other components of the metabolic syndrome were assessed. All patients were followed up for 5 years. The median percentage of excess weight loss was 72.2% at 1 year and 67.8% at 5 years. Of the 52 patients, 84.6% had achieved euglycemia and 73.1% had achieved complete remission, 23.1% partial remission, and 3.84% no remission at 1 year. Weight regain occurred in 8 patients. They required antihypertensive drugs and statins, decreasing the complete remission rate to 57.7% and partial remission rate to 38.5% at 5 years. However, 96.2% improvement in metabolic status was found at the end of 5 years. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective treatment for uncontrolled T2DM in patients with a body mass index of 30-35 kg/m(2). Early-onset T2DM, better weight loss, and greater C-peptide levels were predictors of success after surgery. The improvement after surgery in hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia could help in controlling the occurrence of micro- and macrovascular complications and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with T2DM.",10.1016/j.soard.2012.07.017,,,,160
65,Randomized Trial of Effect of Bariatric Surgery on Blood Pressure After 5 Years.,"Obesity represents a major obstacle for controlling hypertension, the leading risk factor for cardiovascular mortality. The purpose of this study was to determine the long-term effects of bariatric surgery on hypertension control and remission. We conducted a randomized clinical trial with subjects with obesity grade 1 or 2 plus hypertension using at least 2 medications. We excluded subjects with previous cardiovascular events and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. Subjects were assigned to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) combined with medical therapy (MT) or MT alone. We reassessed the original primary outcome (reduction of at least 30% of the total antihypertensive medications while maintaining blood pressure levelsÂ <140/90Â mmÂ Hg) at 5 years. The main analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle. A total of 100 subjects were included (76% women, age 43.8 Â± 9.2 years, body mass index: 36.9 Â± 2.7Â kg/m2). At 5 years, body mass index was 36.40Â kg/m2 (95%Â CI: 35.28-37.52Â kg/m2) for MT and 28.01Â kg/m2 (95%Â CI: 26.95-29.08Â kg/m2) for RYGB (PÂ < 0.001). Compared with MT, RYGB promoted a significantly higher rate of number of medications reduction (80.7% vs 13.7%; relative risk: 5.91; 95%Â CI: 2.58-13.52; PÂ < 0.001) and the mean number of antihypertensive medications was 2.97 (95%Â CI: 2.33-3.60) for MT and 0.80 (95%Â CI: 0.51-1.09) for RYGB (PÂ < 0.001). The rates of hypertension remission were 2.4% vs 46.9% (relative risk: 19.66; 95%Â CI: 2.74-141.09; PÂ < 0.001). Sensitivity analysis considering only completed cases revealed consistent results. Interestingly, the rate of apparent resistant hypertension was lower after RYGB (0% vs 15.2%). Bariatric surgery represents an effective and durable strategy to control hypertension and related polypharmacy in subjects with obesity.

1382,Bariatric surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized trials.,"The clinical efficacy and safety of bariatric surgery trials were systematically reviewed. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL were searched to February 2009. A basic PubCrawler alert was run until March 2010. Trial registries, HTA websites and systematic reviews were searched. Manufacturers were contacted. Randomized trials comparing bariatric surgeries and/or standard care were selected. Evidence-based items potentially indicating risk of bias were assessed. Network meta-analysis was performed using Bayesian techniques. Of 1838 citations, 31 RCTs involving 2619 patients (mean age 30-48 y; mean BMI levels 42-58 kg/m(2) ) met eligibility criteria. As compared with standard care, differences in BMI levels from baseline at year 1 (15 trials; 1103 participants) were as follows: jejunoileal bypass [MD: -11.4 kg/m(2) ], mini-gastric bypass [-11.3 kg/m(2) ], biliopancreatic diversion [-11.2 kg/m(2) ], sleeve gastrectomy [-10.1 kg/m(2) ], Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [-9.0 kg/m(2) ], horizontal gastroplasty [-5.0 kg/m(2) ], vertical banded gastroplasty [-6.4 kg/m(2) ], and adjustable gastric banding [-2.4 kg/m(2) ]. Bariatric surgery appears efficacious compared to standard care in reducing BMI. Weight losses are greatest with diversionary procedures, intermediate with diversionary/restrictive procedures, and lowest with those that are purely restrictive. Compared with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, adjustable gastric banding has lower weight loss efficacy, but also leads to fewer serious adverse effects.",10.1111/j.1467-789X.2011.00866.x,,,,162
720,Short-Term Outcomes of Conversion of Failed Gastric Banding to Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy or Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass: a Meta-Analysis.,"Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is associated with high long-term failure rates, often requiring conversion to an alternative bariatric procedure. The most efficacious procedure after failed LAGB is subject to debate. Our objective was to compare 12-month weight loss following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) vs. laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) performed for insufficient weight loss or weight regain after LAGB. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed and Medline for English language studies comparing weight loss after a conversion surgery for failed gastric banding. We examined studies with patients who had at least 1-year follow-up and included conversions to both LSG and LRYGB. A fixed effects model was created, and variance measures were calculated to measure heterogeneity. Both were analyzed for significance. All statistical analyses were conducted with the ""meta"" package in R 3.3.2. The initial search produced 17 studies. Six studies, consisting of 205 LSG and 232 LRYGB patients, met our inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Heterogeneity among studies was high (Qâ€‰=â€‰23.1; pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in weight loss after 12Â months between the groups (pâ€‰=â€‰0.14). It remains unknown which conversion procedure is more appropriate to perform after a failed gastric band in order to achieve the highest weight loss potential. In our meta-analysis, there was no difference in weight loss after 12Â months in patients who were converted to LSG or LRYGB. Further studies and longer follow-up comparisons are required before firm conclusions can be drawn.",10.1007/s11695-018-3538-8,,,,163
772,Impact of Weight Regain on the Evolution of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: a 3-Year Follow-up.,"The influence of post-surgical weight regain on the course of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is unclear. To evaluate the influence of weight regain on the NAFLD assessed by means of a non-invasive score after Roux-en-gastric bypass (RYGB) over a 3-year period. This is a prospective observational cohort study which evaluated individuals who underwent RYGB. Comparisons were made between the periods immediately before surgery and 12, 24, and 36Â months following surgery. Liver disease was estimated by means of the NAFLD fibrosis score. Individuals were classified into three categories according to weight regain status: (1) no weight regain, (2) expected weight regain (regain less or equal than 20% of the maximal weight lost), (3) obesity recidivism (regain above 20% of the maximal weight lost). Of 90 patients analyzed after 3Â years of surgery, 35.6% presented obesity recidivism and 28.8% of the expected regain; 35.6% presented no regain. There was no difference in baseline fibrosis score between groups; at 3Â years, the score observed in the relapse group was significantly higher than that observed in the other two groups (pâ€‰=â€‰0.015). The percent variation of the fibrosis score was significantly higher in the recidivism group (+â€‰11.8â€‰Â±â€‰77.2%) than in the expected regain (-â€‰45.6â€‰Â±â€‰64.5%) and no regain (-â€‰37.8â€‰Â±â€‰63.2%) groups (pâ€‰=â€‰0.013). Long-term significant post-RYGB weight regain is associated with a significantly attenuated improvement of NAFLD evaluated by means of liver fibrosis score.",10.1007/s11695-018-3286-9,,,,164
1110,Visceral fat area as a new predictor of short-term diabetes remission after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in Chinese patients with a body mass index less than 35 kg/m2.,"Metabolic surgery has been proposed for inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in association with obesity. However, prediction of successful T2DM remission after surgery has not been clearly studied in Chinese patients. The objective of this study was to predict the outcome in those with T2DM after metabolic surgery to help in patient selection. A retrospective review of prospectively collected data of 68 ethnic Chinese with mean body mass index (BMI) of 31.5 and T2DM were examined for the metabolic outcomes at 1 year after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Visceral and abdominal subcutaneous fat areas were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging before and 1 year after RYGB. Remission was defined as a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1 c)<6.5% and no medications at 1 year. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors. At 1 year after surgery, the BMI in the study group decreased from 31.5Â±3.6 to 24.5Â±2.5 kg/m2. Remission was achieved in 50 patients (73.5%) at 1 year. Compared with patients in the nonremission group, patients in the remission group had a shorter duration of diabetes, lower preoperative HbA1 c level, higher fasting C-peptide level, and more visceral fat area (VFA). Preoperative BMI and waist circumference did not differ between the 2 groups. The metabolic improvement in T2DM after RYGB in the mildly obese is greater with a shorter duration of diabetes, higher fasting C-peptide. Those who have more visceral adiposity may obtain greater benefit from RYGB.",10.1016/j.soard.2014.06.019,,,,165
395,Stapleless vs Stapled Gastric Bypass vs Hypocaloric Diet: a Three-Arm Randomized Controlled Trial of Body Mass Evolution with Secondary Outcomes for Telomere Length and Metabolic Syndrome Changes.,"Obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) reduce life expectancy and are challenging to resolve. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with obesity and MetS undergoing surgical vs nonsurgical treatment compared changes in BMI, and secondarily, telomere length (as a biomarker of life expectancy) and changes in MetS components (insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension). Study design was a single-center, prospective, three-arm RCT. Group 1 patients underwent novel unstapled laparoscopic one anastomosis gastric bypass with an obstructive stapleless pouch and anastomosis (LOAGB-OSPAN); Group 2, stapled laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass-one anastomosis gastric bypass (LMGB-OAGB); and Group 3, nonsurgical weight loss therapy via a hypocaloric diet with energy restriction (HDER). The primary outcome measure was change in BMI; secondary outcome measures included change in leukocyte telomere length and other MetS components. Of 96 participants screened, 60 were randomly allocated to 3 groups: LOAGB-OSPAN group (n = 20), LMGB-OAGB group (n = 20), and HDER group (n = 20). At post-treatment month 12, respective BMI changes: BMI -12.13 (-8.34, -15.93); -16.04 (-11.7, 20.37); -2,76 (-3.84, -9.36) (p < 0.01). The two surgical groups experienced significant change in telomere length: LOAGB-OSPAN 2.02 (1.61, 2.41), p = 0.001; LMGB-OAGB 2.07 (1.72, 2.43), p = 0.001; and HDER 0.28 (0.22, 0.78), p = 0.26. The surgical groups were also more effective in treating MetS components. There were no deaths. Adverse events: LOAGB-OSPAN (n = 2) (Clavien-Dindo grade II); LMGB-OAGB (n = 8) (grade I (n = 6) and grade II (n = 2). Compared with hypocaloric diet therapy, both bariatric procedures resulted in greater BMI loss, and secondarily, a significant increase in telomere length, and greater MetS resolution.

962,A New Concept in Bariatric Surgery. Single Anastomosis Gastro-Ileal (SAGI): Technical Details and Preliminary Results.,"In one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB), the measurement of the afferent limb starting at the angle of Treitz may result in insufficient absorptive surface of the intestine of the remaining efferent limb. To address this concern, we recently modified the technique of OAGB by constructing the gastrointestinal anastomosis at a fixed distance from the ileocecal valve (i.e., 300Â cm). We adopted the new concept and named it the single anastomosis gastro-ileal bypass (SAGI). Seven consecutive patients with morbid obesity underwent the SAGI procedure. There were no intraoperative complications and there were no deaths. The mean excess weight (EW) loss was 55.1Â % at 3Â months and 82.1Â % at 6Â months. The SAGI procedure may constitute a safer alternative to the conventional OAGB.",10.1007/s11695-016-2293-y,,,,167

1160,Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy versus laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity and related comorbidities: a meta-analysis of 21 studies.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) are two most common weight loss procedures; our meta-analysis aims to compare these two in the treatment of morbid obesity and its related comorbidities. An electronic literature research of published studies concerning LRYGB and LSG was performed from inception to October 2013. Percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL), resolution or improvement rate of comorbidities, and adverse events were all pooled and compared by the software Review Manager 5.1. As a result, a total of 21 studies involving 18,766 morbidly obese patients were eventually selected according to the inclusion criteria. No significant difference was found in %EWL during 0.5- to 1.5-year follow-up (Pâ€‰>â€‰0.05), but after that, LRYGB achieved higher %EWL than LSG (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Except for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), the difference between these two procedures in the resolution or improvement rate of other comorbidities did not reach a statistical significance (Pâ€‰>â€‰0.05). There were more adverse events in LRYGB compared with LSG (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01). In conclusion, LRYGB is superior to LSG in efficacy but inferior to LSG in safety.",10.1007/s11695-014-1385-9,,,,169
150,Weight-Related Outcomes After Revisional Bariatric Surgery in Patients with Non-response After Sleeve Gastrectomy-a Systematic Review.,"Weight non-response after sleeve gastrectomy is an emerging issue. This systematic review compared revisional procedures for weight-related outcomes. We searched several databases for relevant articles and included adult patients with revisional bariatric procedures after primary sleeve gastrectomy. Twelve trials with 1046 patients were included, covering five revisional procedures. There were no randomised controlled trials, and 10 studies had a critical risk of bias. Significant variations in inclusion criteria, therapy benchmarks, follow-up schemes, and outcome measurements were observed, preventing meaningful comparison of results. Evidence-based treatment strategies for weight non-response after sleeve gastrectomy cannot be deduced from the current literature. Prospective studies with well-defined indications, standardised techniques, and strict adherence to outcome measurements are needed.",10.1007/s11695-023-06630-2,,,,170
512,Effect of Gastric Bypass vs Best Medical Treatment on Early-Stage Chronic Kidney Disease in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Obesity: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Early-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) characterized by microalbuminuria is associated with future cardiovascular events, progression toward end-stage renal disease, and early mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. To compare the albuminuria-lowering effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery vs best medical treatment in patients with early-stage CKD, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. For this randomized clinical trial, patients with established type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria were recruited from a single center from April 1, 2013, through March 31, 2016, with a 5-year follow-up, including prespecified intermediate analysis at 24-month follow-up. A total of 100 patients with type 2 diabetes, obesity (body mass indexes of 30 to 35 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), and stage G1 to G3 and A2 to A3 CKD (urinary albumin-creatinine ratio [uACR] >30 mg/g and estimated glomerular filtration rate >30 mL/min) were randomized 1:1 to receive best medical treatment (nâ€‰=â€‰49) or RYGB (nâ€‰=â€‰51). The primary outcome was remission of albuminuria (uACR <30 mg/g). Secondary outcomes were CKD remission rate, absolute change in uACR, metabolic control, other microvascular complications, quality of life, and safety. A total of 100 patients (mean [SD] age, 51.4 [7.6] years; 55 [55%] male) were randomized: 51 to RYGB and 49 to best medical care. Remission of albuminuria occurred in 55% of patients (95% CI, 39%-70%) after best medical treatment and 82% of patients (95% CI, 72%-93%) after RYGB (Pâ€‰=â€‰.006), resulting in CKD remission rates of 48% (95% CI, 32%-64%) after best medical treatment and 82% (95% CI, 72%-92%) after RYGB (Pâ€‰=â€‰.002). The geometric mean uACRs were 55% lower after RYGB (10.7 mg/g of creatinine) than after best medical treatment (23.6 mg/g of creatinine) (Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). No difference in the rate of serious adverse events was observed. After 24 months, RYGB was more effective than best medical treatment for achieving remission of albuminuria and stage G1 to G3 and A2 to A3 CKD in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity.

1251,Barbed unidirectional V-Loc 180 suture in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a study comparing unidirectional barbed monofilament and multifilament absorbable suture.,"This study aimed primarily to evaluate the safety of digestive running suture (in gastrojejunal and antecolic jejunojejunal anastomosis closure) using unidirectional absorbable barbed suture (V-Loc 180) in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and secondarily to assess the efficacy of V-Loc 180 in reducing operative time. A prospective cohort study of 315 consecutive patients who underwent LRYGB was performed between October 2009 and October 2012 using an identical procedure technique. For the first 76 patients, a multifilament absorbable suture was used to assess the gastrojejunal anastomosis and the antecolic jejunal suture. For the following 239 patients, a unidirectional barbed monofilament suture was used. Data including operative time, time required for gastric pouch creation, time spent in both anastomoses constructions, conversion rate, and complications were prospectively recorded. The postoperative complications did not differ significantly between the two groups. Early complications were observed for 1 patient (1.3%) in the multifilament group and for 14 patients (5.8%) in the barbed procedure group (p > 0.05). Late complications were observed for 1 patient (1.3%) in the multifilament group and for 5 patients (2%) in the barbed procedure group (p > 0.05). A shortened operative time was achieved in the barbed suture group. The mean operative time was 74.3 Â± 15.3 min in the Vicryl group versus 62.7 Â± 15.5 min in the V-Loc group (p < 0.05). The mean operative time required to fashion the gastrojejunal anastomosis was 21.3 Â± 6.3 min in the Vicryl group versus 17.4 Â± 5.1 min in the V-Loc group (p < 0.05). The mean operative time required to fashion the jejunojejunal anastomosis was 21.4 Â± 4.9 min in the Vicryl group versus 15.2 Â± 5.5 min in the V-Loc group (p < 0.05). The authors' experience has demonstrated that the use of interlocked V-Loc suture during LRYGB anastomosis appears to be safe and efficient. The findings show a shortened total operative time in terms of single gastrojejunal or jejunojejunal anastomosis time. No statistically significant differences in early or late postoperative complications were observed between the V-Loc and multifilament absorbable suture patients.",10.1007/s00464-013-2993-5,,,,172

Related articles, which reported outcomes of laparoscopic SADI-S with follow-up â‰¥ 3 years, were selected and analyzed. The percentage of excess weight loss (EWL) was 70.9-88.7%, and 80.4% at 6, and 10 years, respectively. The more common late complications were malabsorption (6.3%) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (3.6%). The remission rates of hypertension, diabetes, GERD, obstructive sleep apnea, and dyslipidemia were 62.9%, 81.3%, 53.2%, 60.9%, and 69.7%, respectively. In conclusion, SADI-S is a safe and effective surgical technique with durable weight loss and a high rate of comorbidity resolution in mid and long term.",10.1007/s11695-023-06846-2,,,,174
1234,Safety and efficacy of barbed suture for gastrointestinal suture: a prospective and randomized study on obese patients undergoing gastric bypass.,"Laparoscopic intracorporeal suturing and knot tying for anastomosis are considered the most difficult laparoscopic skills to master. The aim of this study was to establish the safety and efficacy of barbed suture for intestinal sutures to close the gastrojejunal anastomosis in obese patients undergoing gastric bypass. All consecutive patients undergoing gastric bypass were screened for enrollment in our study. Patients were randomly allocated to undergo knotless anastomosis with barbed suture (V-Locâ„¢ 180; Covidien, Mansfield, MA) (case group) or knot-tying anastomosis with 3/0 polyglactin sutures (Polysorb(Â®); Covidien) (control group). The primary outcome was the time needed for the gastrojejunal anastomosis and the operative time. The secondary outcomes were the incidence of leak, bleeding, and stenosis and the evaluation of the cost of the different procedures evaluated. Among the 60 consecutive patients enrolled in our study, 30 underwent knot-tying anastomosis, and 30 underwent knotless anastomosis. The time needed for the anastomosis was significantly less (P<.001) in the knotless group, whereas no significant differences were found between the two groups for operative time (P=.151). We recorded one leak in the control group and one leak in the case group (P=1.000). One bleeding in the case group (P=1.000) and no stenosis in either group was recorded. Finally, in our experience, the knotless anastomosis was cheaper than the knot-tying anastomosis (P<.001). Our study appears to be encouraging to suggest the use of barbed suture for gastrointestinal anastomosis.",10.1089/lap.2013.0030,,,,175
184,Predictors of marginal ulcer after gastric bypass: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Marginal ulcer (MU) is a common complication following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) with an incidence rate of up to 25%. Several studies have evaluated different risk factors associated with MU with inconsistent findings. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to identify the predictors of MU after RYGB. A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases was conducted through April 2022. All studies that used a multivariate model to assess risk factors for MU after RYGB were included. Pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for risk factors reported inâ€‰â‰¥â€‰3 studies were obtained within a random-effects model. Fourteen studies with 344,829 patients who underwent RYGB were included. Eleven different risk factors were analyzed. Meta-analysis demonstrated that Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection (OR 4.97 [2.24-10.99]), smoking (OR 2.50 [1.76-3.54]), and diabetes mellitus (OR 1.80 [1.15-2.80]), were significant predictors of MU. Increased age, body mass index, female gender, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, and alcohol use were not predictors of MU. There was a trend of an increased risk of MU associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR 2.43 [0.72-8.21]) and a lower risk of MU with proton pump inhibitors use (OR 0.44 [0.11-2.11]). Smoking cessation, optimizing glycemic control, and eradication of HP infection reduce the risk of MU following RYGB. Recognition of predictors of MU after RYGB will allow physicians to identify high-risk patients, improve surgical outcomes, and reduce the risk of MU.",10.1007/s11605-023-05619-7,,,,176
795,Impact of age on postoperative outcomes in bariatric surgery.,"Age is often related to the increase of perioperative complications and reoperation rates. The authors aimed to determine the influence of age on outcomes of most commonly performed bariatric procedures. The retrospective study included patients qualified for primary Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG) or Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB) in two academic hospitals. Patients were divided into two groups: â‰¥50 (21.2-26.9%) and <50 (57.6-73.1%) years old. Endpoints assessed the influence of patients' age on the perioperative and the one-year postoperative period. Operative time was longer in the â‰¥50-year-old group, but only for LRYGB. There were no differences in the intraoperative adverse events, postoperative morbidity, reoperation and readmission rates between the groups. The risk of port site hernia was increased (OR: 4.23, CI: 1.49-12.06) in the â‰¥50-year-old group. The mean % of total weight loss 12 months after the bariatric procedure was comparable, but % of excess weight loss and % of excess body mass index loss were lower in the â‰¥50-year-old group (pâ€‰=â€‰.033 and .032). Bariatric surgery is safe and feasible in patients over 50 years old. The weight loss effect can be worse among patients over 50 years old; nevertheless, the treatment should be considered as effective.",10.1080/00015458.2018.1433797,,,,177
1372,Diabetes remission and insulin secretion after gastric bypass in patients with body mass index <35 kg/m2.,"Most morbidly obese patients who undergo gastric bypass experience rapid remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) but the response in non-morbidly obese patients is not clear. This trial prospectively assessed the effect of diabetes remission, glucose metabolism, and the serial changes of insulin secretion after gastric bypass in inadequately controlled T2DM patients with a BMI of 23-35 kg/m(2). A total of 62 consecutive patients with T2DM and a BMI of 23-35 kg/m(2) underwent gastric bypass. Data were prospectively collected before surgery and 1, 4, 12, 26, and 52 weeks and 2 years after surgery. Insulin secretion was measured by insulinogenic index and area under the curve (AUC) during a standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Remission of type 2 diabetes was defined as fasting glucose level <110 mg/dl and HbA1c <6.0% without any glycemic therapy. Of the 62 patients, 24 were men and 38 were women (age 43.1 Â± 10.8 years). Their preoperative characteristics were as follows: BMI 30.1 Â± 3.3 kg/m(2), waist circumference 99.6 Â± 9.6 cm, C-peptide 3.1 Â± 1.4 ng/ml, and duration of T2DM 5.4 Â± 5.1 years. The mean BMI decreased postoperatively to 22.6 Â± 2.3 kg/m(2) in 1 year and 23.0 Â± 2.7 kg/m(2) in 2 years. The mean HbA1c decreased from 9.7 Â± 1.9% to 5.8 Â± 0.5% in 1 year and 5.9 Â± 0.5% in 2 years. Complete remission of T2DM was achieved in 57% in 1 year and 55% in 2 years after surgery. Before surgery, the OGTT test showed a blunted insulin secretion pattern with an insulinogenic index of 0.1 Â± 0.2 and AUC of 2,324 Â± 1,015 Î¼IU min/ml. In 1 week after surgery, the insulinogenic index increased to 0.16 and AUC decreased to 1,366 Î¼IU min/ml along with a rapid drop of insulin resistance. The insulinogenic index and AUC gradually increased to 0.27 and 3,220, respectively, 1 year after surgery and remained stable up to 2 years with a very low insulin resistance. Laparoscopic gastric bypass facilitates immediate improvement in the glucose metabolism of inadequately controlled non-severe obese T2DM patients, and the benefit is sustained up to 2 years after surgery. The benefit is regulated by the decrease in insulin resistance, increase in early insulin response, and total insulin secretion to glucose load.",10.1007/s11695-011-0401-6,,,,178

506,Safety and Efficacy of Bariatric Surgery in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"The safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients is poorly understood. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis studying safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery in IBD patients as well as the impact of bariatric surgery on IBD course. We conducted a comprehensive search of multiple databases (through September 2019) to identify studies that reported outcome of bariatric surgery in IBD patients. Outcomes assessed included the pooled rate of adverse events, change in medications after bariatric surgery, and 12-month excess weight loss (EWL) and body mass index (BMI) reduction after bariatric surgery. A total of 10 studies were included in final analysis. The pooled rate of early and late adverse events was 15.9% (95% CI, 9.3-25.9) and 16.9% (95% CI, 12.1-23.1), respectively. The rate of adverse events in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was 45.6% (95% CI, 21.9-71.4) compared with 21.6% (95% CI, 11.1-38) in sleeve gastrectomy (pâ€‰=â€‰0.11). The pooled rate of 12-month EWL and BMI reduction after surgery was 66.1% (95% CI, 59.8-72.3%) and 13.7Â kg/m2 (95% CI, 12.5-14.9), respectively. The pooled rate of decrease, increase, and no change of IBD medications were 45.6% (95% CI, 23.8-69.2), 11% (95% CI, 6.3-18.4), and 57.6% (95% CI, 39.2-74.1), respectively. Bariatric surgery has acceptable safety and efficacy profile in IBD patients. Nearly half of patients had decrease in their IBD medications after bariatric surgery, and only 10% experienced therapeutic escalation following bariatric surgery.

Yet, this parameter has not been studied. In this work, gastric content was aspirated from patients before, immediately after, and the day after different bariatric procedures, and pH was immediately measured. Compared to pre-surgery (1.8), pH was increased one day after one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) by 3-4 pH units; pH immediately after these procedures was in between the other 2 time points. Post-OAGB pH was significantly higher than post-LSG (6.4 and 4.9, respectively). Prior adjustable gastric band did not significantly alter baseline pH. We then performed drug dissolution studies of the antiplatelet drugs dipyridamole and aspirin, mimicking pre-surgery, post-LSG and post-OAGB conditions, implementing our pH results and other relevant physiological parameters. Dipyridamole, a weak base, completely dissolved (100% of dose) under pre-surgery conditions, while dissolution was hampered under post-LSG (5%) and post-OAGB (0.25%) conditions, due to solubility limit. Aspirin was not released from enteric-coated tablet under pre-surgery or post-LSG gastric conditions, however, >75% dissolved within 15Â min under post-OAGB gastric conditions, indicating potential failure of enteric coating, depending on the bariatric procedure. In conclusion, special care should be taken when using pH-dependent drugs and drug products after bariatric surgery, and the use of pH-independent formulations should be preferred. Overall, this research revealed the interim gastric pH after different bariatric procedures, and potentially important effects on post-bariatric oral drug delivery and treatment.",10.1016/j.ejpb.2021.01.016,,,,181
1657,Long-limb gastric bypass in the superobese. A prospective randomized study.,"This study was designed to determine whether greater diversion of bile and pancreatic secretions away from the functional gastrointestinal tract would produce greater weight loss in superobese patients (greater than or equal to 200 pounds overweight) in comparison with conventional Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). During the past 7 years, two modifications of RYGB were prospectively compared in 45 superobese patients: RYGB-1, in which the length of defunctionalized jejunum measured 75 cm, and RYGB-2, in which the defunctionalized jejunum measured 150 cm. Respective mean preoperative weight/body mass indexes were 393 pounds/63.4 for 22 RYGB-1 patients and 404 pounds/61.6 for 23 RYGB-2 patients. Two patients (5%) had nonfatal early complications. There were six late incisional hernias. There were no cases of protein deficiency, hepatic dysfunction, or diarrhea after operation. Mean follow-up was 43 +/- 17 months. Postoperative weight loss in pounds and daily calorie intake were compared at 6-month intervals. Weight loss stabilized by 24 months at a mean 50% excess weight lost in RYGB-1 patients and 64% excess weight lost in RYGB-2 patients. Nineteen of 23 RYGB-2 patients achieved at least 50% excess weight lost versus 11 of 22 RYGB-1 patients (p less than or equal to 0.03). Weight loss was significantly greater at 24 through 36 months in RYGB-2 versus RYGB-1 patients (p less than 0.02). There was no significant difference in either calorie intake or incidence of iron and vitamin B-12 deficiency between the two groups. These data show that gastric restriction and biliopancreatic diversion without intestinal exclusion resulted in significantly greater weight loss than conventional RYGB but did not cause additional metabolic sequelae or diarrhea. This long-limb modification of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a safe and effective procedure in patients who are 200 pounds or more overweight.",10.1097/00000658-199204000-00014,,,,182

This systematic review reviews the literature in reference to the efficacy and safety of bariatric surgery on the elderly patient â‰¥ 65 years. A comprehensive search of electronic databases was completed. The data was limited to include only Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients â‰¥ 65 years. Eight primary studies (1835 patients) were included, all case series. Mean age was 67.6 years. Mean excess weight loss at study endpoint was 66.2 %. Mean 30-day mortality was 0.14 %. The mean total post-operative complication rate was 21.1 %, with wound infections being the most common (7.58 %) followed by cardiorespiratory complications (2.96 %).

1350,Is laparoscopic duodenojejunal bypass with sleeve an effective alternative to Roux en Y gastric bypass in morbidly obese patients: preliminary results of a randomized trial.,"The incidence of obesity and related metabolic disorders in India and that of stomach carcinoma is one of the highest in the world. Hence, one requires a procedure that allows postoperative surveillance of the stomach with the best outcomes in terms of weight control and resolution of co-morbidities. Here, we compare one such procedure, duodenojejunal bypass with sleeve against the standard Roux-en Y gastric bypass. Fifty-seven patients who were selected for a bypass procedure were randomized into two groups of laparoscopic duodenojejunal bypass with sleeve (DJB) and laparoscopic Roux en Y gastric bypass. The limb lengths were similar in both the groups, and the sleeve was done over a 36F bougie. The mean body mass index and percent excess weight loss at the end of 3, 6, and 12Â months between the groups were not statistically significant. The operating times were higher in the DJB group. The rate of resolution of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemias were also similar with no statistical significance. There was 100% resolution of dyslipidemias in both groups. There was one patient in the DJB group who presented with internal herniation 1Â month post-op and was managed surgically. There was no mortality in both the groups. Laparoscopic duodenojejunal with sleeve gastrectomy, a procedure which combines the principles and advantages of sleeve gastrectomy and foregut hypothesis, is a safe and effective alternative to gastric bypass in weight reduction and resolution of co-morbidities especially for Asian countries. But, long-term follow-up is required.",10.1007/s11695-011-0507-x,,,,184
289,Body composition changes at 12â€‰months following different surgical weight loss interventions in adults with obesity: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials.,"To determine relative lean mass and fat mass changes in adults with obesity following surgical weight loss interventions, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Scopus were screened for eligible studies. Inclusion criteria included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) performed in populations with obesity (body mass index â‰¥30â€‰kg/m2 ) aged over 18â€‰years, who underwent any type of bariatric surgery and reported body composition measures via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or bio-electrical impedance analysis. Authors conducted full text screening and determined that there were six RCTs eligible for inclusion, with data extracted at 12â€‰months post-surgery. Meta-analysis revealed that, relative to gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) led to greater total body mass loss (mean difference [MD]: -9.33â€‰kg [95% CI: -12.10, -6.56]) and greater fat mass loss (MD: -8.86â€‰kg [95% CI: -11.80, -5.93], but similar lean mass loss (MD: -0.55â€‰kg [95% CI: -3.82, 2.71]. RYGB also led to similar changes in total body mass, fat mass, and lean mass compared with sleeve gastrectomy. RYGB results in greater 12-month weight and fat loss, but similar changes in lean mass, compared with gastric banding. Further RCTs comparing body composition changes following different bariatric surgery procedures are required.",10.1111/obr.13442,,,,185
1411,Obesity-related cardiovascular risk factors after weight loss: a clinical trial comparing gastric bypass surgery and intensive lifestyle intervention.,"Weight reduction improves several obesity-related health conditions. We aimed to compare the effect of bariatric surgery and comprehensive lifestyle intervention on type 2 diabetes and obesity-related cardiovascular risk factors. One-year controlled clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00273104). Morbidly obese subjects (19-66 years, mean (s.d.) body mass index 45.1 kg/m(2) (5.6), 103 women) were treated with either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (n=80) or intensive lifestyle intervention at a rehabilitation centre (n=66). The dropout rate within both groups was 5%. Among the 76 completers in the surgery group and the 63 completers in the lifestyle group, mean (s.d.) 1-year weight loss was 30% (8) and 8% (9) respectively. Beneficial effects on glucose metabolism, blood pressure, lipids and low-grade inflammation were observed in both groups. Remission rates of type 2 diabetes and hypertension were significantly higher in the surgery group than the lifestyle intervention group; 70 vs 33%, P=0.027, and 49 vs 23%, P=0.016. The improvements in glycaemic control and blood pressure were mediated by weight reduction. The surgery group experienced a significantly greater reduction in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome, albuminuria and electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy than the lifestyle group. Gastrointestinal symptoms and symptomatic postprandial hypoglycaemia developed more frequently after gastric bypass surgery than after lifestyle intervention. There were no deaths. Type 2 diabetes and obesity-related cardiovascular risk factors were improved after both treatment strategies. However, the improvements were greatest in those patients treated with gastric bypass surgery.",10.1530/EJE-10-0514,,,,186
1196,The By-Band study: gastric bypass or adjustable gastric band surgery to treat morbid obesity: study protocol for a multi-centre randomised controlled trial with an internal pilot phase.,"The prevalence of severe and complex obesity is increasing worldwide and surgery may offer an effective and lasting treatment. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric band and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery are the two main surgical procedures performed. This open parallel-group randomised controlled trial will compare the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and acceptability of gastric band (Band) versus gastric bypass (Bypass) in adults with severe and complex obesity. It has an internal pilot phase (in two centres) with integrated qualitative research to establish effective and optimal methods for recruitment. Adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 or more, or a BMI of 35 kg/m2 or more and other co-morbidities will be recruited. At the end of the internal pilot the study will expand into more centres if the pre-set progression criteria of numbers and rates of eligible patients screened and randomised are met and if the expected rates of retention and adherence to treatment allocation are achieved. The trial will test the joint hypotheses that Bypass is non-inferior to Band with respect to more than 50% excess weight loss and that Bypass is superior to Band with respect to health related quality of life (HRQOL, EQ-5D) at three years. Secondary outcomes include other weight loss measures, waist circumference and remission/resolution of co-morbidities; generic and symptom-specific HRQOL; nutritional blood test results; resource use; eating behaviours and adverse events. A core outcome set for reporting the results of obesity surgery will be developed and a systematic review of the evidence for sleeve gastrectomy undertaken to inform the main study design. By-Band is the first pragmatic study to compare the two most commonly performed bariatric surgical procedures for severe and complex obesity. The design will enable and empower surgeons to learn to recruit and participate in a randomised study. Early evidence shows that timely recruitment is possible.

721,Long-Term Outcomes After Bariatric Surgery: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Weight Loss at 10 or More Years for All Bariatric Procedures and a Single-Centre Review of 20-Year Outcomes After Adjustable Gastric Banding.,"Durability is a key requirement for the broad acceptance of bariatric surgery. We report on durability at and beyond 10Â years with a systematic review and meta-analysis of all reports providing data at 10 or more years and a single-centre study of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) with 20Â years of follow-up. Systematic review with meta-analysis was performed on all eligble reports containing 10 or more years of follow-up data on weight loss after bariatric surgery. In addition, a prospective cohort study of LAGB patients measuring weight loss and reoperation at up to 20Â years is presented. Systematic review identified 57 datasets of which 33 were eligible for meta-analysis. Weighted means of the percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) were calculated for all papers included in the systematic review. Eighteen reports of gastric bypass showed a weighted mean of 56.7%EWL, 17 reports of LAGB showed 45.9%EWL, 9 reports of biliopancreatic bypass +/- duodenal switch showed 74.1%EWL and 2 reports of sleeve gastrectomy showed 58.3%EWL. Meta-analyses of eligible studies demonstrated comparable results. Reoperations were common in all groups. At a single centre, 8378 LAGB patients were followed for up to 20Â years with an overall follow-up rate of 54%. No surgical deaths occurred. Weight loss at 20Â years (NÂ =Â 35) was 30.1Â kg, 48.9%EWL and 22.2% total weight loss (%TWL). Reoperation rate was initially high but reduced markedly with improved band and surgical and aftercare techniques. All current procedures are associated with substantial and durable weight loss. More long-term data are needed for one-anastomosis gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. Reoperation is likely to remain common across all procedures.",10.1007/s11695-018-3525-0,,,,188
1186,"Gastric bypass with long alimentary limb or long pancreato-biliary limb--long-term results on weight loss, resolution of co-morbidities and metabolic parameters.","Several studies indicate that increasing the alimentary limb length in gastric bypass surgery produces only a minor improvement of excess BMI loss. Few studies have addressed the efficacy of increasing the length of the pancreatico-biliary limb. Here, we present a prospective randomized study of 187 consecutive laparoscopic Roux-Y gastric bypass operations operated over 2 years (2004-2005) in Iceland. The patients were operated with a gastric bypass with either a 2-m biliopancreatic (BP)-limb and a 60-cm alimentary (A)-limb (nâ€‰=â€‰93) or with a 150-cm A-limb and a 60-cm BP-limb (nâ€‰=â€‰94). Preoperative median BMI was 44.1 (38-70), median age 35.5 (17-74) years, and 85 % of the patients were female. Follow-up rate after 5 years was 85 %. Eighteen months following surgery, the weight loss was significantly higher in the BP-limb group (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and this difference remained 7 years after surgery. Weight regain occurred in both groups, and 7 years after surgery, excess BMI loss (EBMIL) was 78.4 % in the BP-limb group compared to 67.1 % in the A-limb group (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Most patients (78 %) needed supplementation adjustment (iron, vitamin D and calcium) during the study period, significantly more often in the BP-limb group compared to the A-limb group (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Patients in the BP-limb group had more frequent stools than patients in the A-limb group; otherwise, gastro-intestinal symptoms rating scoring were comparable. Complication rate was similar. Gastric bypass with a 2-m BP-limb gives better weight loss than gastric bypass with a 60-cm BP-limb and a 150-cm A-limb. Metabolic follow-up is of utmost importance, as most patients needed repeated adjustments of their supplementation.",10.1007/s11695-014-1245-7,,,,189
763,The Impact of Obesity and Metabolic Surgery on Chronic Inflammation.,"Obesity and metabolic surgery is known to improve chronic inflammatory status. Whether improvement is related to anatomical changes or weight loss is still to debate. The aim of this clinical trial is to compare the different bariatric procedures sleeve gastrectomy (SG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and One-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB), pertaining to their effects on inflammation markers. Patients who underwent SG, RYGB, or OAGB as a primary treatment for severe obesity were included. The data collected preoperatively (T0) and 1, 3, and 6 (T6)Â months after surgery included gender, weight, comorbidities and toxic habits at baseline, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, total body weight loss in % (TBWL), leukocyte count in Ã—â€‰103/Î¼l, C-reactive protein (CRP) in mg/l, HbA1c in %, aspartate transaminase in U/l, alanine transaminase in U/l, gamma-glutamyltransferase in U/l, bilirubin in mg/dl, cholesterol in mg/dl, and triglycerides in mg/dl. Four hundred sixty-eight patients were included. Drop-out rate was 25.8% at T6. Preoperatively the mean value of leukocytes and CRP was 7.4â€‰Ã—â€‰103/Î¼lâ€‰Â±â€‰2 and 10.5Â mg/lâ€‰Â±â€‰8.1. At T6, mean value of leukocytes and CRP was 7.1â€‰Ã—â€‰103/Î¼lâ€‰Â±â€‰1.9 (pâ€‰=â€‰0.075) and 7.2Â mg/lâ€‰Â±â€‰9.5 (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). TBWL % at T6 was 24.2â€‰Â±â€‰7.6 in the SG, 25.8â€‰Â±â€‰5.9 in the RYGB and 25.5â€‰Â±â€‰4.6 in the OAGB group. Comparing SG, RYGB, and OAGB in relation to leukocyte count and CRP no significant difference was seen between the groups. CRP but not leukocyte count decreased after all three bariatric procedures but without any significance between the three groups. Surgically induced weight loss and not anatomical changes might play an important role for improvement in chronic inflammation. The National Clinical Trials number was NCT02697695 ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02697695 ).",10.1007/s11695-018-3320-y,,,,190
1248,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass vs intensive medical management for the control of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia: the Diabetes Surgery Study randomized clinical trial.","Controlling glycemia, blood pressure, and cholesterol is important for patients with diabetes. How best to achieve this goal is unknown. To compare Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with lifestyle and intensive medical management to achieve control of comorbid risk factors. A 12-month, 2-group unblinded randomized trial at 4 teaching hospitals in the United States and Taiwan involving 120 participants who had a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 8.0% or higher, body mass index (BMI) between 30.0 and 39.9, C peptide level of more than 1.0 ng/mL, and type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months. The study began in April 2008. Lifestyle-intensive medical management intervention and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. Medications for hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were prescribed according to protocol and surgical techniques that were standardized. Composite goal of HbA1c less than 7.0%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol less than 100 mg/dL, and systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg. All 120 patients received the intensive lifestyle-medical management protocol and 60 were randomly assigned to undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. After 12-months, 28 participants (49%; 95% CI, 36%-63%) in the gastric bypass group and 11 (19%; 95% CI, 10%-32%) in the lifestyle-medical management group achieved the primary end points (odds ratio [OR], 4.8; 95% CI, 1.9-11.7). Participants in the gastric bypass group required 3.0 fewer medications (mean, 1.7 vs 4.8; 95% CI for the difference, 2.3-3.6) and lost 26.1% vs 7.9% of their initial body weigh compared with the lifestyle-medical management group (difference, 17.5%; 95% CI, 14.2%-20.7%). Regression analyses indicated that achieving the composite end point was primarily attributable to weight loss. There were 22 serious adverse events in the gastric bypass group, including 1 cardiovascular event, and 15 in the lifestyle-medical management group. There were 4 perioperative complications and 6 late postoperative complications. The gastric bypass group experienced more nutritional deficiency than the lifestyle-medical management group. In mild to moderately obese patients with type 2 diabetes, adding gastric bypass surgery to lifestyle and medical management was associated with a greater likelihood of achieving the composite goal. Potential benefits of adding gastric bypass surgery to the best lifestyle and medical management strategies of diabetes must be weighed against the risk of serious adverse events. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00641251.",10.1001/jama.2013.5835,,,,191
928,National Differences in Remission of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery-Subgroup Analysis of 2-Year Results of the Diabetes Surgery Study Comparing Taiwanese with Americans with Mild Obesity (BMI 30-35Â kg/m2).,"The purpose of this study is to compare effects of different nations on Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) vs. intensive medical management (IMM) in achieving remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Between April 2008 and December 2011, this randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted at four teaching hospitals in the United States and Taiwan involving 71 participants with mild obesity (BMI 30-35Â kg/m2). Thirty-six of 71 participants were randomly assigned to the RYGB group, and the others were in IMM group. Partial or complete remission of T2DM was defined as blood HbA1cÂ <Â 6.5Â % (48Â mmol/mol) or <6Â % (42Â mmol/mol) without any antihyperglycemic medication for at least 1-year duration, respectively. At baseline, Taiwanese participants had a lower BMI, younger age, and shorter duration of T2DM than American participants. At 24Â months, weight loss was greater in the RYGB group in both populations than in the IMM group. No IMM participant of either population had partial or complete remission of T2DM. In the RYGB group, a substantial proportion of the subjects achieved complete or partial remission (57Â % in Taiwanese and 27Â % in American participants, PÂ =Â 0.08). Logistic regression revealed stimulated C-peptide (Odds ratio 2.22, PÂ =Â 0.02) but not nationality as a significant predictor of diabetes remission. Adding RYGB to lifestyle and medical management was associated with a greater likelihood of remission of T2DM in both Taiwanese and American subjects with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes. Residual beta-cell function at baseline appears to be the major factor predicting remission of T2DM.

678,Single- or double-anastomosis duodenal switch versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass as a revisional procedure for sleeve gastrectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is one of the most commonly performed bariatric procedure worldwide. There is currently no consensus on which revisional procedure is best after an initial SG. To compare the efficacy and safety between single-anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass (SADI) or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) as a revisional procedure for SG. University Hospital, Canada. MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PubMed were searched up to August 2018. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they compared SADI or BPD-DS with RYGB as a revisional bariatric procedure for SG. Primary outcome was absolute percentage of total weight loss. Secondary outcomes were length of stay, adverse events, and improvement or resolution of co-morbidities (diabetes, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia). Pooled mean differences were calculated using random effects meta-analysis. Six retrospective cohort studies involving 377 patients met the inclusion criteria. The SADI/BPD-DS group achieved a significantly higher percentage of total weight loss compared with RYGB by 10.22% (95% confidence interval, -17.46 to -2.97; Pâ€¯=â€¯.006). However, there was significant baseline equivalence bias with 4 studies reporting higher initial body mass index (BMI) in the SADI/BPD-DS group. There were no significant differences in length of stay, adverse events, or improvement of co-morbidities between the 2 groups. SADI, BPD-DS, and RYGB are safe and efficacious revisional surgeries for SG. Both SADI and RYGB are efficacious in lowering initial BMI but there is more evidence for excellent weight loss outcomes with the conversion to BPD-DS when the starting BMI is high. Further randomized trials are required for definitive conclusions.",10.1016/j.soard.2019.01.022,,,,193

The aim of the present study was to test early effects (study endpoint 2 years) of a dissonance-based group intervention on HRQoL (primary outcome) and wellbeing among women who underwent RYGB: a 1-year follow-up of the WELL-GBP trial. Women were recruited from 5 different hospitals in Sweden pre-RYGB surgery. Participants were randomized to intervention or a control group (regular care). The intervention consisted of 4 group sessions, 2 to 3 months post-surgery, comprising the following 4 different topics: (1) physical activity, (2) eating behavior, (3) social relationships, and (4) intimate relationships. Participants answered questionnaires about HRQoL (SF-36, Short-Form Health Survey), social adjustment, body esteem, eating behavior, and wore an accelerometer for 7 days at pre- and 1 year post-RYGB. Two hundred fifty-nine women were recruited and 203 (78%) completed 1-year follow-up measurements.

146,Seven-Year Results of a Randomized Trial Comparing Banded Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass to Sleeve Gastrectomy for Type 2 Diabetes and Weight Loss.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) are common bariatric procedures that are effective in treating type 2 diabetes (T2D) in patients with obesity. Limited data from randomized trials are available comparing longevity of diabetes remission directly between the two procedures beyond 5Â years. A prospective, randomized, parallel, two-arm, clinical trial comparing the outcomes of silastic ring (SR)-LRYGB versus LSG was conducted at a single (Auckland, New Zealand) center. Patients and researchers were blinded until the 5-year mark and follow-up after this was unblinded. Eligible patients had T2D ofâ€‰>â€‰6Â months duration with a BMI 35--65Â kg/m2 and were aged 20-55Â years. Randomization was 1:1 to SR-LRYGB and LSG following induction of anesthesia and was stratified by age group, BMI group, ethnicity, diabetes duration, and insulin therapy. The primary outcome was T2D remission, defined as HbA1câ€‰<â€‰6% (42Â mmol/mol), without the use of glucose-lowering medications. A total of 114 patients were randomized of whom 6 died before the 7-year follow-up (2 SR-LRYGB, 4 LSG). Diabetes remission, assessed in 89 (82.4%) of the remaining patients, was seen in 23/50 (46.0%) after SR-LRYGB and 12/39 (30.8%) after LSG (adjusted OR 4.64, 95% CI 1.39, 15.52, pâ€‰=â€‰0.013).

1322,SLEEVEPASS: a randomized prospective multicenter study comparing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass in the treatment of morbid obesity: preliminary results.,"The long-term efficacy of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in the treatment of morbid obesity has been demonstrated. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) as a single procedure has shown promising short-term results, but the long-term efficacy of SG has not yet been demonstrated. The aim of this study was to determine the preliminary 30-day morbidity and mortality of RYGB and SG in a prospective multicenter randomized setting. A total of 240 morbidly obese (BMI = 35-66 kg/mÂ²) patients evaluated by a multidisciplinary team were randomized to undergo either RYGB or SG. There were 117 patients in the RYGB group and 121 in the SG group; two patients had to be excluded after randomization. Both study groups were comparable regarding age, gender, BMI, and comorbidities. There was no 30-day mortality. The median operating time was significantly shorter in the SG group (66 min vs. 94 min, p < 0.001). All complications were recorded thoroughly. There were 7 (5.8 %) major complications following SG and 11 (9.4 %) after RYGB (p = 0.292). Nine (7.4 %) SG patients and 20 (17.1 %) RYGB patients had minor complications (p = 0.023). The overall morbidity was 13.2 % after SG and 26.5 % after RYGB (p = 0.010). There were three (2.5 %) early reoperations after SG and four (3.3 %) after RYGB (p = 0.719). At 30-day analysis SG is associated with a shorter operating time and fewer early minor complications compared to RYGB. There were no significant differences in major complications or early reoperations. Long-term follow-up is required to determine the effect on weight loss, resolution of obesity-related comorbidities, and improvement of quality of life.",10.1007/s00464-012-2225-4,,,,196
1324,Bariatric surgery versus conventional medical therapy for type 2 diabetes.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and biliopancreatic diversion can markedly ameliorate diabetes in morbidly obese patients, often resulting in disease remission. Prospective, randomized trials comparing these procedures with medical therapy for the treatment of diabetes are needed. In this single-center, nonblinded, randomized, controlled trial, 60 patients between the ages of 30 and 60 years with a body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 35 or more, a history of at least 5 years of diabetes, and a glycated hemoglobin level of 7.0% or more were randomly assigned to receive conventional medical therapy or undergo either gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion. The primary end point was the rate of diabetes remission at 2 years (defined as a fasting glucose level of <100 mg per deciliter [5.6 mmol per liter] and a glycated hemoglobin level of <6.5% in the absence of pharmacologic therapy). At 2 years, diabetes remission had occurred in no patients in the medical-therapy group versus 75% in the gastric-bypass group and 95% in the biliopancreatic-diversion group (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Age, sex, baseline BMI, duration of diabetes, and weight changes were not significant predictors of diabetes remission at 2 years or of improvement in glycemia at 1 and 3 months. At 2 years, the average baseline glycated hemoglobin level (8.65Â±1.45%) had decreased in all groups, but patients in the two surgical groups had the greatest degree of improvement (average glycated hemoglobin levels, 7.69Â±0.57% in the medical-therapy group, 6.35Â±1.42% in the gastric-bypass group, and 4.95Â±0.49% in the biliopancreatic-diversion group). In severely obese patients with type 2 diabetes, bariatric surgery resulted in better glucose control than did medical therapy. Preoperative BMI and weight loss did not predict the improvement in hyperglycemia after these procedures.

738,Long-term weight change and health outcomes for sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and matched Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) participants in the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) study.,"Data from a US multicenter longitudinal study of bariatric surgery were used to compare weight change (primary outcome) and comorbidities (secondary outcome) in patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This study includes participants who underwent sleeve gastrectomy and matched participants who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass from the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 (LABS-2) study. Adults undergoing initial bariatric surgical procedures between 2006 and 2009 were enrolled. Participants who underwent sleeve gastrectomy were high-risk or superobese and intended to have a second-stage procedure. Mixed models were used to evaluate percent weight change from baseline through 7 years, and diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension prevalence through 5 years. Fifty-seven of 59 participants who underwent sleeve gastrectomy were matched one to one. Most were female (68%) and white (81%), and had a median age of 49 (37-56) years and median body mass index of 56.4 (35.5-76.8) kg/m2 presurgery. Weight loss was significantly less 1 to 7 years after sleeve gastrectomy versus matched Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (eg, year 7 mean weight loss was 23.6% vs 30.4%, respectively; Pâ€¯=â€¯.001). For both surgical groups, prevalence of diabetes, low high-density lipoprotein, and hypertension were significantly (P < .05) lower 5 years postsurgery versus baseline. Higher-risk or super-obese participants after sleeve gastrectomy lost less weight than did matched Roux-en-Y gastric bypass counterparts throughout 7 years. Both groups exhibited improvements in comorbidities from presurgery through 5 years.",10.1016/j.surg.2018.06.008,,,,198
277,Comparison of Outcomes Between Banded and Non-banded Sleeve Gastrectomy: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is the most common bariatric procedure performed worldwide. It accounts for more than 50% of primary bariatric surgeries performed each year. Recent long-term data has shown an alarming trend of weight recidivism. Some authors have proposed the concurrent use of a non-adjustable gastric band to decrease long-term sleeve failure. To compare the outcomes (weight loss) and safety (rate of complication and presence of upper GI symptoms) between SG and BSG. A systematic search with no language or time restrictions was performed to identify relevant observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCT) evaluating people with morbid obesity undergoing SG or SGB for weight loss. An inverse-of-the-variance meta-analysis was performed by random effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochrane X2 and I2 analysis. A total of 7 observational studies and 3 RCT were included in the final analysis. There were 911 participants pooled from observational studies and 194 from RCT. BSG showed a significant higher excess of weight loss (% EWL). The difference among groups was clinically relevant after the third year where the weighted mean difference (SMD) was 16.8 (CI 95% 12.45, 21.15, pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001), while at 5Â years, a SMD of 25.59 (16.31, 34.87, pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001) was noticed. No differences related to overall complications were noticed. Upper GI symptoms were up to three times more frequent in the BSG group (OR 3.26. CI 95% 1.96, 5.42, pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). According to the results, BSG is superior to SG in weight loss at 5Â years but is associated with a higher incidence of upper GI symptoms. However, these conclusions are based mainly on data obtained from observational studies. Further RCT are needed to evaluate the effect and safety of BSG.",10.1007/s11695-022-06043-7,,,,199
162,"Bariatric-metabolic surgery versus lifestyle intervention plus best medical care in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (BRAVES): a multicentre, open-label, randomised trial.","Observational studies suggest that bariatric-metabolic surgery might greatly improve non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, the efficacy of surgery on NASH has not yet been compared with the effects of lifestyle interventions and medical therapy in a randomised trial. We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised trial at three major hospitals in Rome, Italy. We included participants aged 25-70 years with obesity (BMI 30-55 kg/m2), with or without type 2 diabetes, with histologically confirmed NASH. We randomly assigned (1:1:1) participants to lifestyle modification plus best medical care, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or sleeve gastrectomy. The primary endpoint of the study was histological resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis at 1-year follow-up. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03524365. Between April 15, 2019, and June 21, 2021, we biopsy screened 431 participants; of these, 103 (24%) did not have histological NASH and 40 (9%) declined to participate. We randomly assigned 288 (67%) participants with biopsy-proven NASH to lifestyle modification plus best medical care (n=96 [33%]), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n=96 [33%]), or sleeve gastrectomy (n=96 [33%]). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the percentage of participants who met the primary endpoint was significantly higher in the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass group (54 [56%]) and sleeve gastrectomy group (55 [57%]) compared with lifestyle modification (15 [16%]; p<0Â·0001). The calculated probability of NASH resolution was 3Â·60 times greater (95% CI 2Â·19-5Â·92; p<0Â·0001) in the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass group and 3Â·67 times greater (2Â·23-6Â·02; p<0Â·0001) in the sleeve gastrectomy group compared with in the lifestyle modification group. In the per protocol analysis (236 [82%] participants who completed the trial), the primary endpoint was met in 54 (70%) of 77 participants in the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass group and 55 (70%) of 79 participants in the sleeve gastrectomy group, compared with 15 (19%) of 80 in the lifestyle modification group (p<0Â·0001). No deaths or life-threatening complications were reported in this study. Severe adverse events occurred in ten (6%) participants who had bariatric-metabolic surgery, but these participants did not require re-operations and severe adverse events were resolved with medical or endoscopic management. Bariatric-metabolic surgery is more effective than lifestyle interventions and optimised medical therapy in the treatment of NASH.

1166,Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy versus single anastomosis (mini-) gastric bypass for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: 5-year results of a randomized trial and study of incretin effect.,"Bariatric surgery may be beneficial in mildly obese patients with poorly controlled diabetes. The optimal procedure to achieve diabetes remission is unknown. In 2011, we published the short-term results of a pilot study designed to evaluate the efficacy of diabetic control and the role of duodenal exclusion in mildly obese diabetic patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) vs. a laparoscopic single anastomosis (mini-) gastric bypass (SAGB). This study analyzes the 5-year results and evaluates the incretin effect. A double-blind randomized trial included 60 participants with a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level higher than 7.5%, a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 35 Kg/m(2), a C-peptide level â‰¥1.0 ng/mL, and a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for at least 6 months. A SAGB with duodenal exclusion or a SG without duodenal exclusion was performed. The 5-year results of the primary outcome were as an intention-to-treat analysis for HbA1c â‰¤6.5% without glycemic therapy. Assessments of the incretin effect and Î² cell function were performed at baseline and between 36 and 60 months. The patients were randomly assigned to SAGB (nâ€‰=â€‰30) and SG (nâ€‰=â€‰30). At 60 months, 18 participants (60%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 42 to 78%) in the SAGB group and nine participants (30%; 95% CI, 13 to 47%) in the SG group achieved the primary end points (odds ratio (OR), 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.8%). The participants assigned to the SAGB procedure had a similar percentage of weight loss as the SG patients (22.8â€‰Â±â€‰5.9 vs. 20.1â€‰Â±â€‰5.3%; pâ€‰>â€‰0.05) but achieved a lower level of HbA1c (6.1â€‰Â±â€‰0.7 vs. 7.1â€‰Â±â€‰1.2 %; pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) than the SG patients. There was a significant increase in the incretin effect before and after surgery in both groups, but the SAGB group had a higher incretin effect than the SG group at 5 years. In mildly obese patients with T2DM, SG is effective at improving glycemic control at 5 years, but SAGB was more likely to achieve better glycemic control than SG and had a higher incretin effect compared to SG.",10.1007/s11695-014-1344-5,,,,201
1424,"Bariatric surgery versus lifestyle interventions for morbid obesity--changes in body weight, risk factors and comorbidities at 1 year.","Few studies have looked at non-surgical alternatives for morbid obese patients. This study aims to compare 1-year weight loss and changes in risk factors and comorbidities after bariatric surgery and three conservative treatments. Patients with morbid obesity (BMI > 40 or BMI > 35 kg/m(2) plus comorbidities) on waiting list for bariatric surgery, were non-randomly allocated to (A) bariatric surgery or to one of three conservative treatments; (B) residential intermittent program; (C) commercial weight loss camp and (D) hospital outpatient program. Body weight, risk factors and comorbidities were assessed at baseline and 1 year. Of 206 participants, 179 completed the study. All treatments resulted in significant weight loss, but bariatric surgery (40 Â± 14 kg, 31 Â± 9%) led to the largest weight loss (P < 0.0001). There were no differences in weight loss between B and C (22 Â± 13 kg, 15 Â± 8% vs. 18 Â± 12 kg, 13 Â± 8%), but these resulted in larger weight loss compared with D (7 Â± 10 kg, 5 Â± 8%). There were no differences in changes in total or LDL cholesterol, triacylglycerols or glucose between groups; however, the increase in HDL cholesterol was significantly larger in groups A and C. There were no differences in comorbidities resolution between groups A and B, C and D combined (except hypertension, which was better in group A). In conclusion, although bariatric surgery leads to a greater weight loss at 1 year compared with conservative treatment, in patients with morbid obesity, clinical significant weight loss and similar improvements in risk factors and comorbidities resolution can also be achieved with lifestyle interventions.",10.1007/s11695-010-0131-1,,,,202
833,A Prospective Single-Arm Trial of Modified Long Biliopancreatic and Short Alimentary Limbs Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass in Type 2 Diabetes Patients with Mild Obesity.,"Type-2 diabetes (T2D) patients with body mass index (BMI) below 35Â kg/m2 carry lower remission rates than severely obese T2D individuals submitted to ""standard limb lengths"" Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Mild-obese patients appear to have more severe forms of T2D, where the mechanisms of glycemic control after a standard-RYGB may be insufficient. The elongation of the biliopancreatic limb may lead to greater stimulation of the distal intestine, alterations in bile acids and intestinal microbiota, among other mechanisms, leading to better metabolic outcomes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the RYGB with a biliopancreatic limb of 200Â cm in the control of T2D in patients with BMI 30-35Â kg/m2. From January 2011 to May 2015, 102 T2D patients with BMI from 30 to 34.9Â kg/m2 underwent laparoscopic RYGB with the biliopancreatic-limb of 200Â cm and the alimentary-limb of 50Â cm. There were no deaths or reoperations. The mean follow-up was 28.1Â months. The mean BMI dropped from 32.5 to 25.1Â kg/m2, while the mean fasting glucose decreased from 182.9 to 89.8Â mg/dl and the mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) went from 8.7 to 5.2%. During follow-up, 92.2% had their T2D under complete control (HbA1cÂ <Â 6%, no anti-diabetic medications), while 7.8% were under partial control. Control of hypertension and dyslipidemia were 89.4 and 85.5%, respectively. No patient developed hypoalbuminemia, and there were mild micronutrient deficiencies. RYGB with long-biliopancreatic and short-alimentary limbs is safe and seems effective in achieving complete control of T2D in patients with BMIs between 30 and 35Â kg/m2.",10.1007/s11695-017-2933-x,,,,203
686,Effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery on diabetes remission and complications in individuals with type 2 diabetes: a Danish population-based matched cohort study.,"The aim of this study was to examine the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery on diabetes remission, subsequent diabetes relapse and micro- and macrovascular complications in individuals with type 2 diabetes and obesity (BMI >35Â kg/m2) in a real-world setting. This was a population-based cohort study of 1111 individuals with type 2 diabetes treated by RYGB at hospitals in Northern Denmark (2006-2015), and 1074 matched non-operated individuals with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes remission was defined as no glucose-lowering drug use with HbA1c <48Â mmol/mol (<6.5%), or metformin monotherapy with HbA1c <42Â mmol/mol (<6.0%). Data on complications were ascertained from medical registries with complete follow-up. At 1Â year of follow-up, 74% of the cohort treated by RYGB experienced diabetes remission, while 27% had relapsed after 5Â years. Predictors of non-remission were age >50Â years, diabetes duration >5Â years, use of glucose-lowering drugs other than metformin, and baseline HbA1c >53Â mmol/mol (>7.0%). Compared with the non-operated cohort using adjusted Cox regression (5.3Â years follow-up), the cohort treated by RYGB had 47% lower risk of microvascular complications (HR 0.53 [95% CI 0.38, 0.73]) and a statistically non-significant 24% lower risk of macrovascular complications (HR 0.76 [95% CI 0.49, 1.18]). Diabetes remission vs non-remission at 1Â year was associated with reduced HR of 0.43 (95% CI 0.25, 0.72) for microvascular complications and with HR of 0.76 (95% CI 0.40, 1.45) for macrovascular complications. In routine clinical care, three out of four individuals with type 2 diabetes and obesity treated by RYGB experienced diabetes remission after 1Â year, whereas 27% of these individuals had relapsed at 5Â years follow-up. RYGB was associated with substantially decreased risk of microvascular complications and non-significantly fewer macrovascular complications, with early diabetes remission as a clear predictor of reduced microvascular complications.",10.1007/s00125-019-4816-2,,,,204
481,Three-Year Outcomes of Bariatric Surgery in Patients With Obesity and Hypertension : A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Midterm effects of bariatric surgery on patients with obesity and hypertension remain uncertain. To determine the 3-year effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on blood pressure (BP) compared with medical therapy (MT) alone. Randomized clinical trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01784848). Investigator-initiated study at Heart Hospital (HCor), SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Patients with hypertension receiving at least 2 medications at maximum doses or more than 2 medications at moderate doses and with a body mass index (BMI) between 30.0 and 39.9 kg/m2 were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio). RYGB plus MT or MT alone. The primary outcome was at least a 30% reduction in total number of antihypertensive medications while maintaining BP less than 140/90 mm Hg. Key secondary outcomes were number of antihypertensive medications, hypertension remission, and BP control according to current guidelines (<130/80 mm Hg). Among 100 patients (76% female; mean BMI, 36.9 kg/m2 [SD, 2.7]), 88% from the RYGB group and 80% from the MT group completed follow-up. At 3 years, the primary outcome occurred in 73% of patients from the RYGB group compared with 11% of patients from the MT group (relative risk, 6.52 [95% CI, 2.50 to 17.03]; P < 0.001). Of the randomly assigned participants, 35% and 31% from the RYGB group and 2% and 0% from the MT group achieved BP less than 140/90 mm Hg and less than 130/80 mm Hg without medications, respectively. Median (interquartile range) number of medications in the RYGB and MT groups at 3 years was 1 (0 to 2) and 3 (2.8 to 4), respectively (P < 0.001). Total weight loss was 27.8% and -0.1% in the RYGB and MT groups, respectively. In the RYGB group, 13 patients developed hypovitaminosis B12 and 2 patients required reoperation. Single-center, nonblinded trial. RYGB is an effective strategy for midterm BP control and hypertension remission, with fewer medications required in patients with hypertension and obesity.

Nevertheless, there is still conflicting data regarding surgical safety in this population. The aim of this study was to compare the surgical morbidity of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) for older patients. University hospital, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. We performed a prospective randomized clinical trial from September 2017 to May 2019. Obese patients aged â‰¥65 years were randomized to LSG or LRYGB. Data collection included demographic information, body mass index (BMI), and co-morbidities. We assessed readmission, postoperative complications, and mortality. Complications were scored according to Clavien-Dindo classification. A total of 36 patients, with a BMI between 35.5 and 52.8 kg/m2 were randomized to either LSG (18 patients) or LRYGB (18 patients). The overall complication rate was similar between LSG and LRYGB (3 versus 7, P = .13). Severe complication was more prevalent in LRYGB patients but had no statistically significant difference (0 versus 3, P = .07). Each group had 1 readmission and there was no mortality in 90-day follow-up. Morbidity and mortality rates of bariatric surgery are low in elderly obese patients. Despite not statistically significant, LSG had a lower rate of severe complications compared withÂ LRYGB in this population setting.",10.1016/j.soard.2020.05.030,,,,206
1128,Effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease evaluated through NAFLD fibrosis score: a prospective study.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common among subjects who undergo bariatric surgery and its postsurgical improvement has been reported. This study aimed to determine the evolution of liver disease evaluated through NAFLD fibrosis score 12 months after surgery. It is a prospective cohort study which evaluated patients immediately before and 12 months following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Mean score decreased from 1.142 to 0.066; surgery led to a resolution rate of advanced fibrosis of 55 %. Resolution was statistically associated with female gender, percentage of excess weight loss, postsurgical body mass index, postsurgical platelet count, and diabetes resolution. As previously reported by studies in which postsurgical biopsies were performed, RYGB leads to a great resolution rate of liver fibrosis. Since postsurgical biopsy is not widely available and has a significant risk, calculation of NAFLD fibrosis score is a simple tool to evaluate this evolution through a noninvasive approach.",10.1007/s11695-014-1489-2,,,,207
376,The effects of bariatric surgery on dyslipidemia and insulin resistance in overweight patients with or without type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"Obesity has become an epidemic in several regions globally; it may lead to cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Despite many therapies, all bariatric procedures fail in some patients. There is a lack of literature comparing treatment effects on specific metabolic indexes. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for relevant articles. GeMTC and R software were used to perform a network meta-analysis, draw forest plots, investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity, generate I2 statistics, rank probabilities, and evaluate relative effects of surgical procedures. All analyses were based on a Bayesian consistency model. We included 35 randomized controlled trials, comprising 2198 individuals and 13 interventions. For patients with high insulin resistance, single-anastomosis (mini-) gastric bypass (SAGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) may be effective options, with mean differences (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of -4.45 (-9.04 to -.34) and -4.23 (-6.74 to -2.22), respectively, compared with control groups. For patients with severe dyslipidemia, in addition to SAGB and SG, duodenal switch (DS) may be an effective surgery, with mean differences (95% CIs) of -.97 (-1.39 to -.55), -1.98 (-3.76 to -.19), .53 (.04 to 1.04), and -.94 (-1.66 to -.16) compared with control groups in terms of triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations, respectively. In adult overweight patients with or without diabetes, SAGB and SG are most effective at ameliorating insulin resistance. SAGB, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass + omentectomy, and DS are useful for reducing triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL-C. SG + omentectomy elevates HDL-C concentrations best. Adjustable gastric band and biliopancreatic diversion may not control insulin resistance or dyslipidemia well.",10.1016/j.soard.2021.04.005,,,,208
1410,Weight loss outcome after silastic ring Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: 8 years of follow-up.,"An underlying major aim of bariatric surgery is weight loss and its long-term maintenance. In spite of this, most studies regarding weight loss after surgical treatment of morbid obesity show 3-year follow-up results. We evaluated the effectiveness of silastic ring Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (SR-RYGBP) in promoting significant weight loss after an 8-year follow-up at the Londrina State University Hospital. From May 1999 to December 2000, 211 morbidly obese patients were submitted to SR-RYGBP by the same surgical team. The study's design was longitudinal, prospective, and descriptive. The analysis of postoperative weight decrease was based on excess weight loss in percentage (%EWL) and the calculation of body mass index. Therapeutic failure was considered when patients lost <50% of excess weight. Patients lost to follow-up were 36.5%; therefore, 134 patients were included in this study. The average global EWL was 67.6â€‰Â±â€‰14.9% on the first postoperative year, 72.6â€‰Â±â€‰14.9% on the second year, 69.7â€‰Â±â€‰15.1% on the fifth postoperative year, and 66.8â€‰Â±â€‰7.6% on the eight postoperative year. Surgical treatment failure occurred in 15 patients (7.1%) over 8Â years. SR-RYGBP was effective in promoting and maintaining weight loss in the long term with a low failure rate.",10.1007/s11695-010-0264-2,,,,209
35,Preoperative risk factors for early postoperative bleeding after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Although bariatric surgery is an effective intervention for obesity, it comes with risks such as early postoperative bleeding (EPB). Identifying preoperative risk factors for this complication can help patients' risk stratification and optimization. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to find predictors for early postoperative bleeding after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). We conducted a systematic review, searching PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science until November 2023. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis to explore preoperative risk factors associated with early postoperative bleeding after RYGB. Sources of heterogeneity were explored by leave-one-out analyses. 23 studies were included, comprising 232,488 patients. Male gender (meta-analytical RRâ€‰=â€‰1.42, 95%CIâ€‰=â€‰1.21-1.66, I2â€‰=â€‰18%, Q Cochran test p-valueâ€‰=â€‰0.29) and revisional surgery (meta-analytical RRâ€‰=â€‰1.35, 95%CIâ€‰=â€‰1.12-1.62, I2â€‰=â€‰22%, Q Cochran test pâ€‰=â€‰0.21) were associated with higher risk of EPB. On average, patients with EPB were older than the remainder (MD for the mean ageâ€‰=â€‰2.82 years, 95%CIâ€‰=â€‰0.97-4.67, I2â€‰=â€‰0.00%, Q Cochran test pâ€‰=â€‰0.46).

A total of 66 studies examining 1918 patients were included in this study with 70% of female predominance. Twenty studies reported RGB on 1751 patients and 46 studies reported remnant gastrectomy after gastric bypass in 167 patients. The most common etiology of RGB was related to the in situ remnant stomach neoplasia in 10 studies on 981 patients; mostly for preventive intentions in high prevalence areas. Remnant gastrectomy after gastric bypass was performed to treat a complication such as GGF, retrograde bile reflux gastritis, cancer mostly adenocarcinoma. Studies revealed that RGB has similar weight loss in comparison to standard Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.",10.1007/s11695-024-07240-2,,,,211
725,Network meta-analysis of the relative efficacy of bariatric surgeries for diabetes remission.,"Bariatric surgery leads to a higher remission rate for type 2 diabetes mellitus than non-surgical treatment. However, it remains unsolved which surgical procedure is the most efficacious. This network meta-analysis aimed to rank surgical procedures in terms of diabetes remission. We electronically searched for randomized controlled trials in which at least one surgical treatment was included among multiple arms and the diabetes remission rate was included in study outcomes. A random-effects network meta-analysis was performed within a frequentist framework. The hierarchy of treatments was expressed as the surface under the cumulative ranking curve value. Results of the analysis of 25 eligible randomized controlled trials that covered non-surgical treatments and eight surgical procedures (biliopancreatic diversion [BPD], BPD with duodenal switch, Roux-en Y gastric bypass, mini gastric bypass [mini-GBP], laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, greater curvature plication and duodenal-jejunal bypass) showed that BPD and mini-GBP had the highest surface under the cumulative ranking curve values among the eight surgical treatments. Current network meta-analysis indicated that BPD or mini-GBP achieved higher diabetes remission rates than the other procedures. However, the result needs to be interpreted with caution considering that these procedures were in the minority of bariatric surgeries.",10.1111/obr.12751,,,,212
1637,Vertical banded gastroplasty versus standard or distal Roux-en-Y gastric bypass based on specific selection criteria in the morbidly obese: preliminary results.,"Predicting successful outcomes after bariatric surgical procedures has been difficult, and the establishment of specific selection criteria has been a subject of ongoing research. In an effort to choose the most appropriate surgical procedure for each patient, we have established a specific set of selection criteria for each procedure based on degree of obesity, preoperative dietary habits, eating behavior, and various metabolic features. From June 1994 to December 1998, 90 bariatric surgical procedures were performed at the authors' institution by a single surgeon (F.K.) based on specific selection criteria. Vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) was performed in 35 patients, standard Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in 38 patients, and distal RYGB in 17 patients. All patients were monitored postoperatively 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and once per year thereafter, with an additional visit at 18 months in distal RYGB patients. Early postoperative morbidity (<30 days) did not differ significantly between the three groups and averaged 9% of total patients. Long-term postoperative morbidity (>30 days) included 9 incisional hernias (2 in the VBG group, 5 after RYGB, and 2 in the distal RYGB group). There were 6 cases of staple-line disruption, 4 after VBG and 2 after standard RYGB, 1 of which resulted in stomal ulcer. Early postoperative mortality was 0%, and long-term mortality was 1.1%, which was due to pulmonary embolism in 1 standard RYGB patient on the 65th postoperative day. Average percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) was 62% the first year, 61% the second year, and 50% the third year in VBG patients, and 63.6%, 65%, and 63.3%, respectively, in standard RYGB patients. In distal RYGB patients, where the patient number was significantly smaller, the %EWL at 1 and 2 years, respectively, was 51% and 53%. The most significant metabolic/nutritional complication was the appearance of hypoproteinemia (hypoalbuminemia) in 1 distal RYGB patient 20 months after surgery, which was corrected by total parenteral nutrition and subsequent increase in dietary protein intake. Significant improvement or resolution of preexisting comorbid conditions was observed in all patient groups. The postoperative quality of eating, as evaluated by variety of food intake and frequency of vomiting, was significantly better in RYGB patients. These results show that selection of the bariatric surgical procedure to be performed in each patient based on specific criteria leads to acceptable weight loss, improvement in preexisting comorbid conditions, and a high degree of patient satisfaction in most patients. On the basis of our own observations as well as those of others, our selection criteria have become more strict over time and our selection of VBG as the operation of choice increasingly infrequent.",10.1381/096089299765552701,,,,213
1017,Mini Gastric Bypass: first report of 125 consecutive cases from United Kingdom.,"Mini Gastric Bypass is a promising bariatric procedure with multiple apparent benefits. Ours is the first unit within the National Health Service of the United Kingdom to be routinely performing this procedure. This retrospective cohort study reports our experience with first 125 procedures. Data were retrospectively analysed from a prospective database. Information was further supplemented by interviewing team members, contacting patients' general practitioners and telephonic follow-up. The mean follow-up was 11.4 months. There were 86 (68.8%) females and the mean age was 45 (range 20-70) years. Mean weight and body mass index was 135.8 (range 85-244) kilograms and 48.1 (range 34.5-73.8) kgâ€‰m(-2) , respectively. The mean operating time was 92.4 (range 45-150) minutes and the mean post-operative hospital stay was 2.2 (range 2-17) days. There was no leak, one 30-day reoperation and no mortality in this study. Three patients required late reoperations and four patients developed marginal ulcers. At 6 months follow-up (nâ€‰=â€‰114), 27.5 (range 11.4-47.4) % total body weight loss and 60.1 (range 23.2-117.5) % excess body weight loss was seen. The figures at 12 months follow-up (nâ€‰=â€‰65) were 36.8 (range 23.7-55.4) % and 79.5 (range 44.9-138.3) %, respectively.

1085,Revisional Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy: a Systematic Review of Comparative Outcomes with Respective Primary Procedures.,"Though primary bariatric surgery is now firmly established as the first-line treatment for morbid obesity, this is not the case with revisional bariatric surgery. Despite proven benefits and patient demand, revisional bariatric surgery continues to attract controversy. Even though it is widely believed to be riskier and less effective than primary bariatric surgery, there is currently no systematic review in literature addressing this point. This review aims to establish outcomes after revisional bariatric surgery in comparison with those after primary bariatric surgery. Since Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy is currently the commonest anatomy achieved after revisional bariatric surgery, this review focuses on the outcome of revisional Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and revisional sleeve gastrectomy in comparison with respective primary procedures.",10.1007/s11695-015-1670-2,,,,215
1172,A meta-analysis of 2-year effect after surgery: laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity and diabetes mellitus.,"Literature search was performed for bariatric surgery from inception to September 2013, in which the effects of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) on body mass index (BMI), percentage of excess weight loss (EWL%), and diabetes mellitus (DM) were compared 2 years post-surgery. A total of 9,756 cases of bariatric surgery from 16 studies were analyzed. Patients receiving LRYGB had significantly lower BMI and higher EWL% compared with those receiving LSG (BMI mean difference (MD)â€‰=â€‰-1.38, 95% confidence interval (CI)â€‰=â€‰-1.72 to -1.03; EWL% MDâ€‰=â€‰5.06, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.24 to 9.89). Improvement rate of DM was of no difference between the two types of bariatric surgeries (RRâ€‰=â€‰1.05, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.90 to 1.23). LRYGB had better long-term effect on body weight, while both LRYGB and LSG showed similar effects on DM.",10.1007/s11695-014-1303-1,,,,216
745,A Longer Biliopancreatic Limb in Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Improves Weight Loss in the First Years After Surgery: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Despite the fact that the RYGB is performed on a broad scale worldwide as a reliable treatment for morbid obesity, there is no uniform technique for this operation. A number of studies have tried to demonstrate an additional weight loss effect by lengthening the alimentary limb, but to no avail. At this moment in time, the role of the biliopancreatic limb on weight loss is for the greater part unknown. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to compare the effect on weight loss of a long biliopancreatic limb Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LBP-GB) with a standard RYGB (S-GB). A LBP-GB (BPL 150Â cm, alimentary limb 75Â cm) was compared with a S-GB (BPL 75Â cm, alimentary limb 150Â cm). One hundred forty-six patients were randomized in two groups. Weight loss, morbidity, reduction of comorbidities, nutritional status, and quality of life were measured during a period of 4Â years. Patient characteristics were comparable in both groups. Mean EWL in the LBP-GB group after 12, 24, 36, and 48Â months was 81, 85, 78, and 72% respectively versus 71, 73, 68, and 64% in the S-GB group. The %EWL difference between groups was significant as soon as 9Â months postoperatively and continued throughout the follow-up period. While LBP-GB achieved a significant increase in %EWL in the first years after surgery, no difference in long-term %TWL was observed after 4Â years. In this study, the advantage of LBP-GB with respect to weight loss is modest, but shows promising gripping points for future improvements in RYGB design.",10.1007/s11695-018-3421-7,,,,217
134,Effect of bariatric surgery on cardio-psycho-metabolic outcomes in severe obesity: A randomized controlled trial.,"Randomized evidence comparing the cardiovascular effects of surgical and conservative weight management is lacking. In this single-center, open-label randomized trial, obese patients with indication for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and able to perform treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) were included. After a 6-12Â month run-in phase of multimodal anti-obesity treatment, patients were randomized to RYGB or psychotherapy-enhanced lifestyle intervention (PELI) and co-primary endpoints were assessed 12Â months later. Thereafter, PELI patients could opt for surgery and patients were reassessed 24Â months after randomization. Co-primary endpoints were mean change (95Â % confidence intervals) in peak VO2 (ml/min/kg body weight) in CPET and the physical functioning scale (PFS) of the Short Form health survey (SF-36). Of 93 patients entering the study, 60 were randomized. Among these (median age 38Â years; 88Â % women; mean BMI 48Â·2Â kg/m2), 46 (RYGB: 22 and PELI: 24) were evaluated after 12Â months. Total weight loss was 34Â·3Â % after RYGB vs. 1Â·2Â % with PELI, while peak VO2 increased by +4Â·3Â ml/min/kg (2Â·7, 5Â·9) vs +1Â·1Â ml/min/kg (-0Â·2, 2Â·3); pÂ <Â 0Â·0001. Respective improvement in PFS score was +40 (30, 49) vs +10 (1, 15); pÂ <Â 0Â·0001. 6-minute walking distance also favored the RYGB group: +44Â m (17, 72) vs +6Â m (-14, 26); pÂ <Â 0Â·0001. Left ventricular mass decreased after RYGB, but not with PELI: -32Â g (-46, -17) vs 0Â g (-13,13); pÂ <Â 0Â·0001. In the non-randomized follow-up, 34 patients were assessed. Favorable changes were sustained in the RYGB group and were repeated in the 15 evaluated patients that opted for surgery after PELI. Among adults with severe obesity, RYGB in comparison to PELI resulted in improved cardiopulmonary capacity and quality of life. The observed effect sizes suggest that these changes are clinically relevant.",10.1016/j.metabol.2023.155655,,,,218
1626,"Laparoscopic vs open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a prospective, randomized trial.","The feasibility of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (Lap-RYGBP) for morbid obesity is well documented. In a prospective randomized trial, we compared laparoscopic and open surgery. 51 patients (48 females, mean (+/- SD) age 36 +/- 9 years and BMI 42 +/- 4 kg/m2) were randomly allocated to either laparoscopy (n = 30) or open surgery (n = 21). All patients were followed for a minimum of 1 year. In the laparoscopy group, 7 patients (23%) were converted to open surgery due to various procedural difficulties. In an analysis, with the converted patients excluded, the morphine doses used postoperatively were significantly (p < 0.005) lower in the laparoscopic group compared to the open group. Likewise, postoperative hospital stay was shorter (4 vs 6 days, p < 0.025). Six patients in the laparoscopy group had to be re-operated due to Roux-limb obstruction in the mesocolic tunnel within 5 weeks. The weight loss expressed in decrease in mean BMI units after 1 year was 14 +/- 3 and 13 +/- 3 after laparoscopy and open surgery, respectively (not significant). Both laparoscopic and open RYGBP are effective and well received surgical procedures in morbid obesity. Reduced postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay and shorter sick-leave are obvious benefits of laparoscopy but conversions and/or reoperations in 1/4 of the patients indicate that Lap-RYGBP at present must be considered an investigational procedure.",10.1381/096089201321336610,,,,219
330,Gastric Bypass Versus Sleeve Gastrectomy in Type 2 Diabetes: Effects on Hepatic Steatosis and Fibrosis : A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Weight loss improves fatty liver disease. No randomized trial has compared the effects of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on liver fat content and fibrosis. To compare the 1-year effects of SG and RYGB on hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. Single-center, randomized, controlled trial (Oseberg [ObesitySurgery in TÃ¸nsberg]). (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01778738). Tertiary care obesity center in Norway. 100 patients (65% female; mean age, 47.5 years; mean body mass index, 42 kg/m2) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). From January 2013 to February 2018, patients were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to SG or RYGB. The primary outcome was remission of T2DM (previously published). Predefined secondary outcomes in the present study were hepatic steatosis and fibrosis assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (liver fat fraction), enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test, noninvasive indices, and liver enzymes. Liver fat fraction declined similarly after SG (-19.7% [95% CI, -22.5% to -16.9%]) and RYGB (-21.5% [CI, -24.3% to -18.6%]) from surgery to 1-year follow-up, and almost all patients (SG, 94%; RYGB, 100%) had no or low-grade steatosis at 1 year. The ELF score category remained stable in 77% of patients, but 18% experienced worsening of fibrosis at 1 year, with no substantial between-group difference. Single-center study, short follow-up time, and lack of power for secondary outcomes. With an almost complete clearance of liver fat 1 year after surgery, RYGB and SG were both highly effective in reducing hepatic steatosis. Bariatric surgery had less influence on degree of fibrosis in the short term, but assessment of long-term progression is warranted.

45,"Impact of Probiotics on Gastrointestinal Function and Metabolic Status After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: A Double-Blind, Randomized Trial.","Postoperative changes in gut microbiota may occur in patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. In this study, we evaluate the impact of administering probiotic tablets on the gastrointestinal function and metabolic status of these patients. This double-blinded randomized clinical trial was conducted from 2021 to 2022 on 135 Roux-en-Y surgery candidates. The intervention group underwent the surgical procedure and started receiving probiotic supplements (Familact Co.) 1 week after surgery; the control group received a placebo. The laboratory and anthropometric data were measured and analyzed before and 3 and 6 months after the intervention. GIQLI questionnaire was also used at the beginning and 6 months after the intervention to evaluate GI symptoms. We observed significantly reduced BMI in both groups after surgeries (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The levels of FBS and HbA1C were significantly lower in the probiotic group compared to the placebo in 3 months (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.02 and Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001, respectively) and 6Â months (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001 for both) after the intervention. The levels of vitamin B12 increased significantly in the probiotic group (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and the values were substantially higher than the placebo group in 3 and 6 months (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), respectively. Analysis of the GIQLI questionnaire before and 6 months after interventions also revealed significant improvement in the GIQLI score in both groups (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001 for probiotics and Pâ€‰=â€‰0.03 for placebo). Probiotic supplement administration following RYGB improves patients' vitamin and metabolic profile, as well as GI function, although it cannot significantly affect weight loss.",10.1007/s11695-024-07225-1,,,,221
1194,StomaphyX vs a sham procedure for revisional surgery to reduce regained weight in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients : a randomized clinical trial.,"Revisional laparoscopic surgery after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has been linked to substantial complications and morbidity. To investigate the safety and effectiveness of endoscopic gastric plication with the StomaphyX device vs a sham procedure for revisional surgery in RYGB patients to reduce regained weight. A prospective, single-center, randomized, single-blinded study from July 2009 through February 2011, evaluating revisional surgery using StomaphyX was conducted in patients with initial weight loss after RYGB performed at least 2 years earlier. We planned for 120 patients to be randomized 2:1 to multiple full-thickness plications within the gastric pouch and stoma using the StomaphyX device with SerosFuse fasteners or a sham endoscopic procedure and followed up for 1 year. The primary efficacy end point was reduction in pre-RYGB excess weight by 15% or more excess body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) loss and BMI less than 35 at 12 months after the procedure. Adverse events were recorded. Enrollment was closed prematurely because preliminary results indicated failure to achieve the primary efficacy end point in at least 50% of StomaphyX-treated patients. One-year follow-up was completed by 45 patients treated with StomaphyX and 29 patients in the sham treatment group. Primary efficacy outcome was achieved by 22.2% (10) with StomaphyX vs 3.4% (1) with the sham procedure (Pâ€‰<â€‰.01). Patients undergoing StomaphyX treatment experienced significantly greater reduction in weight and BMI at 3, 6, and 12 months (Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰.05). There was one causally related adverse event with StomaphyX, that required laparoscopic exploration and repair. StomaphyX treatment failed to achieve the primary efficacy target and resulted in early termination of the study. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00939055.",10.1001/jamasurg.2013.4051,,,,222
896,Do sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass influence treatment with proton pump inhibitors 4 years after surgery? A nationwide cohort.,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common obesity-related co-morbidity that routinely is treated by continuous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. A number of concerns have been raised regarding the risk of de novo GERD or exacerbation of preexisting GERD after sleeve gastrectomy (SG). To assess PPI use at 4 years after bariatric surgery. French National Health Insurance. Data were extracted from the French National Health Insurance database. All adult obese patients who had undergone gastric bypass (GBP) (n = 8250) or SG (n = 11,923) in 2011 in France were included. Patients were considered to be on continuous PPI therapy when PPIs were dispensedâ‰¥6 times per year. Logistic regression models were used to compute odds ratios for potential risk factors for PPI reimbursement 4 years after surgery. Overall, continuous use of PPIs increased from baseline to 4 years after SG and GBP, from 10.9% to 26.5% (P<.001) and from 11.4% to 21.9% (P<.001), respectively. Among patients who underwent PPI therapy before surgery, those who had undergone SG were more likely to continue PPI therapy 4 years after surgery compared with those who underwent GBP (72.7% versus 59.2%; P<.001). In multivariate analyses, the major risk factors for persistent continuous PPI treatment 4 years after surgery were the following: SG (odds ratio [OR] = 1.87; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.55-2.25), higher body mass index (OR 1.85; 95% CI 1.35-2.5), and preoperative antidepressant treatment (OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.56-2.29). At a nationwide scale, continuous PPI treatment is used by 1 of 10 obese patients before bariatric surgery, but by 1 of 4 patients 4 years after surgery. SG compared with GBP, higher body mass index, and other coexisting conditions are the 3 major risk factors for medium-term continuous PPI therapy.",10.1016/j.soard.2016.12.013,,,,223
1199,Does patient compliance with follow-up influence weight loss after gastric bypass surgery? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Gastric bypass surgery is an effective intervention to manage morbid obesity. However, there have been suggestions that patients who do not comply to follow-up lose less weight. This study evaluated the influence of patient's follow-up compliance on weight loss post gastric bypass surgery. From the search of MEDLINE and EMBASE, four studies (nâ€‰=â€‰365) were identified and majority of these studies concluded that compliance with follow-up leads to increased weight loss. Our meta-analysis of these studies found increase in the percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) at 1-year post gastric bypass surgery (mean difference 6.38Â % %EWL, 95Â % CI 1.68-11.15) when patients were compliant with follow-up. Therefore, this review found that continued long-term follow up of gastric bypass patients has the potential to increase postoperative weight loss.",10.1007/s11695-014-1178-1,,,,224
397,Long versus short biliopancreatic limb in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: short-term results of a randomized clinical trial.,"The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass continues to be one of the most performed bariatric surgeries because of its adequate balance of outcomes, complications, and durability. Recently, the role of the biliopancreatic limb on weight loss and co-morbidity control has gained attention because it seems to have a positive impact based on limb length. To compare results at 12 months of a ""standard"" (group 1) versus a long (group 2) biliopancreatic limb bypass. Biliopancreatic limbs were 50 cm and 200 cm, and alimentary limbs were 150 cm and 50 cm, respectively. Academic Referal Center; Mexico City; Public Seeting. Randomized study with patients undergoing both types of surgeries at a single academic center from 2016 to 2018. The analysis included weight loss, co-morbidity control (diabetes and hypertension), biochemical panel, operative outcomes, and complications. Two-hundred ten patients were included (105 in each group). Almost all data were homogenous at baseline. Female sex comprised 86.1% of cases, with a mean body mass index of 43.5 kg/m2. Excess weight loss (77.6 Â± 15.7% versus 83.6 Â± 16.7%; P = .011) and total weight loss (33.5 Â± 6.4% versus 37.1 Â± 7.1%; P < .001) was higher in group 2; better HbA1C levels were also observed. Co-morbidity outcomes, operative data, and complications were similar between groups. The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with 200 cm of biliopancreatic limb length induces more weight loss at 12 months than a 50 cm limb length. Better HbA1C levels were also observed, but similar effects on co-morbidities and complications were noted.",10.1016/j.soard.2021.03.030,,,,225
320,Insufficient weight loss after banded vs. non-banded primary gastric bypass surgery: insights from an observational 5Â year follow-up study.,"While Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is effective in achieving weight loss and improving obesity-related co-morbidities, insufficient weight loss in the long-term can occur. The goal was to assess whether banded vs. non-banded RYGB reduces the risk of insufficient weight loss at 5-year follow-up. This is a retrospective single-center cohort study from Switzerland. We assessed the 5-year metabolic trajectories in terms of body weight, body mass index, glucose control, lipid profile and blood pressure of two surgical cohorts undergoing identical RYGB procedures with or without banding using a uniform 6.5Â cm silastic Fobi band. Insufficient weight loss was defined asâ€‰<â€‰50% excess weight loss (EWL) at 5Â years. A total of 55 patients receiving banded (Fobi) and 55 patients receiving non-banded (non-Fobi) RYGB were included in the analysis. 5-year follow-up was 91% for both groups. Percentage of EWL at 5Â years was 78.11â€‰Â±â€‰26.1% and 73.5â€‰Â±â€‰27%.3 for the Fobi vs. non-Fobi group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.368), respectively. Insufficient weight loss (defined asâ€‰<â€‰50%EWL) at 5Â years or last follow-up was significantly higher in the non-Fobi group compared to the Fobi group (19/55 vs. 9/55, respectively, ORâ€‰=â€‰2.639 (95% CI 1.066, 6.531), pâ€‰=â€‰0.036). Surrogate markers for cardiometabolic outcomes consistently improved over time, without differences between the groups. During the follow-up period, Fobi-removal was necessary in nine patients (16.3%). Banded-RYGB lowered the odds of insufficient weight loss at 5Â years follow-up by approximately 62%. Further research is needed to explore the effect of restriction on eating behaviour and neuroendocrine responses after RYGB.",10.1007/s00464-021-08952-7,,,,226
337,Physical activity in women attending a dissonance-based intervention after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: A 2-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial.,"The majority of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) patients are not sufficiently physically active post-surgery, yet little support from the Swedish healthcare system is offered. We investigated if a dissonance-based group intervention, aiming to increase health-related quality of life after surgery, had any effect on patients' physical activity two years post-RYGB. Women undergoing RYGB surgery were recruited from five Swedish hospitals and randomized to intervention or control group (standard post-surgery care). The dissonance-based intervention was conducted three months post-RYGB and consisted of four group sessions, each with a specific topic, of which one addressed physical activity. ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers were used to measure physical activity at pre-RYGB, one- and two-years post-surgery. At pre-RYGB, 259 women were recruited and randomized (intervention n = 156 and control n = 103). Participants had a mean age of 44.7 years (SD 10.3) and pre-RYGB body mass index of 40.8 (SD 4.5) kg/m2. At two-years follow-up, 99 participants (63.5%) in intervention group and 68 (66.0%) in control group had valid accelerometer-measurements. Pre- to post-surgery increases were seen in all physical activity outcomes, but no statistically significant differences between the groups were observed at the two-years follow-up, and intervention effects were poor (d = 0.02-0.35). To our knowledge, this is the first dissonance-based intervention targeting women undergoing RYGB surgery. At two-years follow-up, we did not observe any differences in physical activity levels between the intervention group and control group.

354,Meta-analysis of Long-Term Relapse Rate of Type 2 Diabetes Following Initial Remission After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.,"This study aims to determine the long-term relapse rate of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) following initial remission after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. We searched studies in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. A total of 17 eligible studies were included for analysis. Meta-analysis suggested a pooled long-term relapse rate of 0.30 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26-0.34) and a remission rate of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.55-0.72) after RYGB and a hazard ratio of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.66-0.81) for comparison of RYGB and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Subgroup analyses established pooled results. This study suggested RYGB may be a preferred regime for obese patients with T2DM because it is associated with lower long-term relapse and relatively higher initial remission and was also superior to SG due to lower risk of recurrence.",10.1007/s11695-021-05692-4,,,,228
284,Time impact on the antidiabetic effects of key bariatric surgeries:Â aÂ network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials with meta-regression.,"Few studies compare the efficacy of the key bariatric procedures in type 2 diabetes management over the long term. None offer a reliable comparison of their respective efficacy loss over time. To analyze and compare the time evolution of the antidiabetic effects of the key bariatric procedures. Obesity surgery departments in America, Europe, and Asia. All the randomized clinical trials assessing the efficacy of bariatric surgery in type 2 diabetes management with 1-5 years of follow-up were reviewed. A network meta-analysis with meta-regression was performed to compare the effectiveness of each technique and its respective efficacy loss temporal dynamics. Thirty-one trials involving 1906 patients were included. In comparison to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, the 5-year complete or partial diabetes remission rates were inferior with medical treatment (odds ratio [OR] = .05; 95% credible interval [CrI]: .02-.13) and gastric banding (ORÂ = .38; 95% CrI: .16-.87), equivalent with sleeve gastrectomy (OR = 1.08; 95% CrI: .59-1.97), and superior with 1 anastomosis gastric bypass (OR = 3.00; 95% CrI: 1.12-8.33) and biliopancreatic diversion and its affiliated techniques (OR = 3.71; 95% CrI: 1.16-12.55). However, remission rates and glycemic control progressively decreased whatever the treatment option evaluated. Moreover, this loss of efficacy followed a statistically comparable temporal dynamic to those of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass regardless of the therapeutic strategy implemented. No therapeutic modality offered stable antidiabetic effects. The gap observed between the techniques after a 5-year follow up concerning remission rates and glycemic control could depend essentially on the magnitude of the effects initially obtained. However, these results need to be confirmed over longer follow-up periods.",10.1016/j.soard.2022.02.003,,,,229
1119,Self-report of gastrointestinal side effects after bariatric surgery.,"Data on gastrointestinal (GI) side effects of bariatric surgery are limited because of incomplete reporting, cross-sectional samples, and nonstandardized assessments. To report on GI side effects over the first 6 months after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). Academic medical center, United States. One hundred forty-four patients completed a standardized clinical interview 6 months after operation, including questions on the occurrence and frequency of episodes of dumping syndrome, vomiting, and plugging for each of the past 6 months; monthly rates were stable, so results were averaged over the entire period. Although data were collected as part of a randomized controlled trial, randomization group and the interaction of group by surgical procedure were not related to GI side effects. Thus, results are reported by procedure only (RYGB, n = 87; LAGB, n = 56). RYGB patients had a higher preoperative body mass index (BMI) than LAGB patients (46.8Â±6.8 versus 43.5Â±4.8 kg/m(2), respectively; P = .001), were more likely to report dumping (45.7% versus 4.7%, P<.0001), and were less likely to report plugging (45.7% versus 79.1%, P = .0005). Vomiting did not differ significantly by procedure (68.6% versus 65.1%, P = .7). Most patients experienced each GI side effect less than once per week. Although self-reported GI side effects were common over the first 6 months after operation, the frequency of episodes was relatively low. Longer-term follow-up is needed to determine whether symptoms worsen or improve over time.",10.1016/j.soard.2014.08.007,,,,230
1129,Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus adjustable gastric banding to reduce nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a 5-year controlled longitudinal study.,"To compare the long-term benefit of gastric bypass [Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)] versus adjustable gastric banding (AGB) on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in severely obese patients. NAFLD improves after weight loss surgery, but no histological study has compared the effects of the various bariatric interventions. Participants consisted of 1236 obese patients (body mass index=48.4Â±7.6 kg/m), enrolled in a prospective longitudinal study for up to 5 years after RYGB (n=681) or AGB (n=555). Liver biopsy samples were available for 1201 patients (97.2% of those at risk) at baseline, 578 patients (47.2%) at 1 year, and 413 patients (68.9%) at 5 years. At baseline, NAFLD was present in 86% patients and categorized as severe [NAFLD activity score (NAS)â‰¥3] in 22% patients. RYGB patients had a higher body mass index (49.8Â±8.2 vs 46.8Â±6.5 kg/m, P<0.001) and more severe NAFLD (NAS: 2.0Â±1.5 vs 1.7Â±1.4, P=0.004) than AGB patients. Weight loss at 5 years was 25.5%Â±11.8% after RYGB versus 21.4%Â±12.7% after AGB (P<0.001). When analyzed with a mixed model, all NAFLD parameters improved after surgery (P<0.001) and improved significantly more after RYGB than after AGB [steatosis (%): 1 year, 7.9Â±13.7 vs 17.9Â±21.5, P<0.001/5 years, 8.7Â±7.1 vs 14.5Â±20.8, P<0.05; NAS: 1 year, 0.7Â±1.0 vs 1.1Â±1.2, P<0.001/5 years, 0.7Â±1.2 vs 1.0Â±1.3, P<0.05]. In multivariate analysis, the superiority of RYGB was primarily but not entirely explained by weight loss. The improvement of NAFLD was superior after RYGB than after AGB.",10.1097/SLA.0000000000000945,,,,231
1534,"The malabsorptive very, very long limb Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for super obesity: results in 257 patients.","For the past 11 years, we have used a malabsorptive form of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), the ""very, very long limb"" RYGB, for selected patients with BMIs >50 kg/m(2) and in highly selected patients with BMI <50 kg/m(2). This modified distal gastric bypass establishes a 100-cm common channel (for digestion and absorption) and a ""very, very"" long Roux limb of 400 to 500 cm. To determine long-term efficacy and complications, we followed prospectively 257 consecutive patients; 188 (73%) participated in a postoperative survey. Of the patients, 60% were female; overall age (x +/- SD) was 45 +/- 11 years, and BMI was 61 +/- 11 kg/m(2). Operative mortality was 1% with substantive postoperative morbidity occurring in 13%. Eighty-two percent of patients returning the survey an average of 48 months postoperatively (range, 12 to 148 months) lost >50% of excess body weight; BMI at follow-up was 37 +/- 9 kg/m(2). Resolution of comorbidities included diabetes mellitus (94%), hypertension (65%), sleep apnea (48%), and asthma (30%). Side effects included mild food intolerance (82%), occasional loose or watery stools (71%), nephrolithiasis (16%), and symptomatic steatorrhea (5%). Nine patients (4%) who developed or were developing impending protein/calorie malnutrition required proximal relocation of the enteroenterostomy with symptom resolution. Overall, 90% were satisfied with the operation, and 93% would recommend it to a friend. The very, very long limb RYGB is relatively safe and effective and has acceptable side effects in the treatment of selected patients with super obesity (BMI >50). Because of the possibility of malabsorptive sequelae, patients should be selected based on degree of medical sophistication, insight, and compliance.",10.1016/j.surg.2006.06.020,,,,232
1559,Surgery for morbid obesity.,"Obesity is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Surgery for morbid obesity is considered when other treatments have failed. A number of procedures are available, but the effects of these surgical procedures compared with medical management and with each other are uncertain. To assess the effects of surgery for morbid obesity. Studies were obtained from computerized searches of multiple electronic bibliographic databases, supplemented with hand searches of selected journals and consultation with experts in obesity research. Date of the most recent searches: December 2004. Randomised controlled trials comparing different surgical procedures, and randomised controlled trials and prospective cohort studies comparing surgery with non-surgical management for morbid obesity. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked independently by two reviewers. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality. Twenty-six trials were included. Two randomised controlled trials and three prospective cohort studies compared surgery with non-surgical management, and 21 randomised controlled trials compared different surgical procedures. The quality of most of the trials was poor; just three trials had adequate allocation concealment. A meta-analysis was not possible due to differences in the surgical procedures performed, measures of weight change and length of follow-up. Compared with conventional management, surgery resulted in greater weight loss (21 kg weight loss at eight years versus weight gain), with improvements in quality of life and comorbidities. Some complications of surgery occurred, such as wound infection. Gastric bypass was associated with greater weight loss, better quality of life and fewer revisions, reoperations and/or conversions than gastroplasty, but had more side-effects. Greater weight loss and fewer side-effects and reoperations occurred with adjustable gastric banding than vertical banded gastroplasty, but laparoscopic vertical banded gastroplasty produced more patients with an excellent or good result and fewer late complications than laparoscopic adjustable silicone gastric banding. Vertical banded gastroplasty was associated with greater weight loss but more vomiting than horizontal gastroplasty. Some postoperative deaths occurred in the studies. Weight loss was similar between open and laparoscopic procedures. Fewer serious complications occurred with laparoscopic surgery, although conversion to open surgery was sometimes required. Most studies found that laparoscopic surgery had a longer operative time. But, it resulted in reduced blood loss and quicker recovery. The limited evidence suggests that surgery is more effective than conventional management for weight loss in morbid obesity. The comparative safety and effectiveness of different surgical procedures is unclear.",10.1002/14651858.CD003641.pub2,,,,233
1400,Erosive esophagitis after bariatric surgery: banded vertical gastrectomy versus banded Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Obesity is associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the most performed bariatric procedure in the world, whereas sleeve gastrectomy is an emerging procedure. Both can be combined with the use of a SilasticÂ® ring. The aim of this study was to compare the evolution of erosive esophagitis (EE) in patients who underwent SilasticÂ® ring gastric bypass (SRGB) and SilasticÂ® ring sleeve gastrectomy (SRSG) after a 1-year postoperative period. We carried out a non-randomized, prospective, controlled clinical study. Sixty-five patients were enrolled based on the following inclusion criteria: female gender, age 20-60 years old, BMI 40-45 and written informed consent. The exclusion criteria were secondary obesity, alcohol or drug use, severe psychiatric disorder, binge-eating of sweets, and previous stomach or bowel surgery. The patients were divided into two groups-33 (51%) underwent SRSG and 32 (49%) patients underwent SRGB. All patients underwent an esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy during the preoperative period and at 12-14 months after the surgery. Preoperatively, 15 patients (23.8%) were found to have EE, six (19.4%) in the SRSG group and nine patients (28.1%) in the SRGB group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.7795). Postoperatively, there was an increase in the number of patients with EE in the SRSG group to 14 (45.2%) and a decrease in the SRGB group to two (6.3%), giving a total of 16 patients with EE (25.4%; pâ€‰=â€‰0.0007). After 1 year of follow-up, we observed a worsening evolution of EE in the SRSG group, but improvement in the SRGB group.",10.1007/s11695-010-0321-x,,,,234
1573,"Lifestyle, diabetes, and cardiovascular risk factors 10 years after bariatric surgery.","Weight loss is associated with short-term amelioration and prevention of metabolic and cardiovascular risk, but whether these benefits persist over time is unknown. The prospective, controlled Swedish Obese Subjects Study involved obese subjects who underwent gastric surgery and contemporaneously matched, conventionally treated obese control subjects. We now report follow-up data for subjects (mean age, 48 years; mean body-mass index, 41) who had been enrolled for at least 2 years (4047 subjects) or 10 years (1703 subjects) before the analysis (January 1, 2004). The follow-up rate for laboratory examinations was 86.6 percent at 2 years and 74.5 percent at 10 years. After two years, the weight had increased by 0.1 percent in the control group and had decreased by 23.4 percent in the surgery group (P<0.001). After 10 years, the weight had increased by 1.6 percent and decreased by 16.1 percent, respectively (P<0.001). Energy intake was lower and the proportion of physically active subjects higher in the surgery group than in the control group throughout the observation period. Two- and 10-year rates of recovery from diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertension, and hyperuricemia were more favorable in the surgery group than in the control group, whereas recovery from hypercholesterolemia did not differ between the groups. The surgery group had lower 2- and 10-year incidence rates of diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperuricemia than the control group; differences between the groups in the incidence of hypercholesterolemia and hypertension were undetectable. As compared with conventional therapy, bariatric surgery appears to be a viable option for the treatment of severe obesity, resulting in long-term weight loss, improved lifestyle, and, except for hypercholesterolemia, amelioration in risk factors that were elevated at baseline.",10.1056/NEJMoa035622,,,,235
253,Perforated marginal ulcer after gastric bypass for obesity: a systematic review.,"Marginal ulcers are a recognized complication of gastric bypass procedures for obesity. Perforated marginal ulcer (PMU) is a life-threatening complication of marginal ulcers. We performed a systematic review to understand the presentation, management, and outcomes of PMUs. PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase databases were searched to identify all studies on PMUs after gastric bypass procedures. A total of 610 patients were identified from 26 articles. The mean age was 39.8Â±2.59 years, and females represented most of the cohort (67%). The mean body mass index was 43.2Â±5.67 kg/m2. Most of the patients had undergone a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (98%). The time gap between the primary bariatric surgery and the diagnosis of PMU was 27.5Â±8.56 months. The most common presenting symptom was abdominal pain (99.5%) and a computed tomography scan was the diagnostic modality used in 72% of the patients. Only 15% of patients were on prophylactic proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers at the time of perforation, and 41% of patients were smoking at the time. Twenty-three percent of patients were on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Laparoscopic omental patch repair of the perforation (59%) was the most used technique; 18% of patients underwent open surgery, and 20% were managed non-surgically. Thirty-day mortality was 0.97%; it was 1.21% (n=5) and 0% (n=0) in those who were managed surgically and nonsurgically, respectively. Ulcers recurred in 5% of patients. In conclusion, PMU is a surgical emergency afterÂ gastric bypass that can result in significant morbidity and even mortality. This is the first systematic review in scientific literature characterizing this condition.",10.1016/j.soard.2022.05.024,,,,236
616,Comparison of Repeat Sleeve Gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in Case of Weight Loss Failure After Sleeve Gastrectomy.,"Few series are available on the results of repeat sleeve gastrectomy (re-SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) performed to manage the failure of primary sleeve gastrectomy (SG). The objective of this study was to compare the short- and medium-term outcomes of re-SG and RYGB after SG. Between January 2010 and December 2017, patients undergoing re-SG (nâ€‰=â€‰61) and RYGB (nâ€‰=â€‰83) for failure of primary SG were included in this study. Revisional surgery was proposed for patients with insufficient excess weight loss (EWLâ€‰â‰¤â€‰50%) or weight regain. The primary endpoint was the comparison of weight loss in the re-SG group and the RYGB group at the 1-year follow-up. The secondary endpoints were overall mortality and morbidity, specific morbidity, length of stay, weight loss, and correction of comorbidities. The mean interval between SG and re-SG was 41.5 vs. 43.2Â months between SG and RYGB (pâ€‰=â€‰0.32). The mean operative time was 103Â min (re-SG group) vs. 129.4Â min (RYGB group). One death (1.7%; re-SG group) and 25 complications (17.4%; 9 in the re-SG group, 16 in the RYGB group) were observed. At the 1Â year, mean body mass index was 31.6 in the re-SG group and 32.5 in the RYGB group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.61) and excess weight loss was 69.5 vs. 61.2, respectively (pâ€‰=â€‰0.05). Re-SG and RYGB as revisional surgery for SG are feasible with acceptable outcomes and similar results on weight loss on the first postoperative year.",10.1007/s11695-019-04123-9,,,,237
553,Endoscopic Argon Plasma Coagulation vs. Multidisciplinary Evaluation in the Management of Weight Regain After Gastric Bypass Surgery: a Randomized Controlled Trial with SHAM Group.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is one of the most widely performed bariatric surgeries. However, the relapse of obesity occurs in approximately 20% of patients and enlargement of the anastomosis is one of the factors associated with this relapse. Endoscopic treatment of the anastomosis has been proposed to assist in renewed weight loss. One endoscopic technique is the narrowing of the anastomosis argon plasma coagulation (APC). Evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the endoscopic treatment of an enlarged anastomosis with APC. A randomized controlled study was conducted comparing APC to exclusive multidisciplinary management after weight regain. Forty-two patients were divided into two groups: APC (nâ€‰=â€‰22) and control (nâ€‰=â€‰20). After 14Â months of follow-up with a crossover at 6Â months, significant improvement in satiety and greater weight loss were found in the APC group and after crossover. APC was associated with significant weight loss [9.73 (7.46, 12) vs. +â€‰1.38 (-â€‰1.39, 2.15)], a reduction in the anastomosis diameter [pâ€‰<â€‰0.001], early satiation [0.77 (0.44, 1.11) vs. -â€‰0.59 (-â€‰0.95, -â€‰0.23), pâ€‰<â€‰0.001], and increased quality of life measured using the EQ5D index [pâ€‰=â€‰0.04] and EQ5D VAS scale [pâ€‰=â€‰0.04]. Considering total mean weight loss throughout the entire follow-up, weight loss was similar in both groups (13.02Â kg in the APC and 11.52Â kg in the control). Treatment of the gastrojejunal anastomosis with APC was effective and safe, with significant weight loss, the return of early satiation, and an improvement in quality of life.",10.1007/s11695-020-04414-6,,,,238
985,"Comparative effectiveness of 3 bariatric surgery procedures: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, laparoscopic adjustable gastric band, and sleeve gastrectomy.","Bariatric surgery is associated with improved co-morbidities, quality of life, and survival in severely obese patients. Common bariatric surgery procedures include Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB), and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Currently, literature studying comparative effectiveness on different bariatric surgery procedures in veterans is limited. To compare effectiveness of 3 bariatric surgery procedures performed in veterans. Veterans Affairs Loma Linda Healthcare Systems (VALLHS), Loma Linda, California, United States. This study was a single-institution, retrospective cohort study. Primary outcome was weight reduction, expressed as kilograms lost, body mass index (BMI) reduction, percentage weight loss (%WL), and percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) after 12 months of bariatric surgery. Secondary outcomes were reduction in number of medications and laboratory markers for obesity-related chronic conditions. Inverse-probability weighting propensity score method was used to balance baseline characteristics among the procedures. A total of 162 patients were included in the study. At 12 months, the kilograms lost, BMI reduction, %WL, and %EWL were 40.7Â±14.5 kg, 13.4Â±4.1 kg/m(2), 31.5Â±8.5%, and 41.4Â±11.6% for RYGB; 24.4Â±22.1 kg, 7.9Â±7.3 kg/m(2), 20.2Â±21.5%, and 26.7Â±27.6% for SG; and 15.3Â±15.7 kg, 5.0Â±5.0 kg/m(2), 12.0Â±11.7%, and 16.1Â±15.9% for LAGB, respectively (RYGB versus SG, RYGB versus LAGB, and SG versus LAGB, all P<.01). The reduction in number of medications, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) also showed significant improvement with RYGB. For the short term, RYGB appears to achieve better weight reduction and management of obesity-associated co-morbid conditions compared with the SG and LAGB procedures in veteran patients. SG could be the next alternative over LAGB for the bariatric surgery procedure in patients who are not candidates for RYGB.",10.1016/j.soard.2016.01.020,,,,239
630,Assessment of Changes in Body Composition During the First Postoperative Year After Bariatric Surgery.,"The potential effect of bariatric surgery on weight reduction and improvement of associated comorbidities is known, but the ratio obtained between the components of body weight, including lean body mass, body fat mass, and bone mass, is still not determined. This study aims to verify the changes in body composition during the first year after bariatric surgery. We conducted a prospective observational cohort study. Fifty patients who underwent bariatric surgery and maintained follow-ups were selected. Patients were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively for periods of 1, 3, 6, and 12Â months using tetrapolar bioelectrical impedance analysis and laboratory testing of lipids and serum albumin levels. Data were statistically analyzed. Statistically significant differences (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) were obtained between the preoperative and 12-month evaluation respectively, for body mass index (BMI) (45.8â€‰Â±â€‰7.5 to 30.0â€‰Â±â€‰4.8Â kg/m2), FM (64.7â€‰Â±â€‰15.5 to 30.6â€‰Â±â€‰9.8Â kg), PFM (51.6â€‰Â±â€‰4.17 to 37.3â€‰Â±â€‰7.6%), and total cholesterol levels (197.1â€‰Â±â€‰49.8 to 169.8â€‰Â±â€‰31.0Â mg/dL). The decrease in PFM shows a better proportion between the body components. PFM showed significantly higher decrease in males than in females (pâ€‰=â€‰0.012). Lean body mass (pâ€‰=â€‰0.000) reduction was highest for patients operated by the Unified Health System (SUS, Government of Brazil) probably because of its few financial resources to maintain postoperative care. The change in body composition of patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was statistically significant for all variables examined during the first year postoperatively. This shows the effectiveness of the surgical procedure and clinical protocol set, which tends to favor a better health prognosis and weight maintenance in the long term.",10.1007/s11695-019-03980-8,,,,240
1604,Comparison of objective outcomes following laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication versus laparoscopic gastric bypass in the morbidly obese with heartburn.,"Heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) affects approximately 25-50% of morbidly obese patients. Although objective physiologic testing has been reported extensively in patients following Nissen fundoplication, there are no previous reports of such testing in morbidly obese patients. A life-saving surgical alternative for the morbidly obese patient is gastric bypass surgery, which usually improves heartburn symptoms in addition to many serious health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and sleep apnea. We hypothesized that, in morbidly obese patients, gastric bypass surgery would be as effective as Nissen fundoplication in reducing both heartburn symptoms and esophageal acid exposure, as reflected by the DeMeester score. Between 1995 and 2000, all patients undergoing laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LN) and laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGB) in our practice underwent preoperative and postoperative esophageal physiologic testing. Patients were included in this study that were morbidly obese and had significant heartburn symptoms or objective evidence of acid reflux, and had repeat esophageal physiologic testing after either LN or LGB. Data were obtained through retrospective review of prospectively collected data. Twelve patients met the inclusion criteria: six patients who had LN and six who had LGB. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 55 kg/m2 in the LGB group and 39.8 in the LN group. After surgery, the mean DeMeester score decreased from 64.3 to 2.8 in the LN group ( p = 0.01) and from 34.7 to 5.7 in the LGB group ( p = 0.1). Both groups' mean postoperative DeMeester scores were normal after surgery, and there was no significant difference between the two groups ( p = 0.3). Both groups experienced a significant improvement in heartburn symptoms postoperatively. The mean preoperative symptom score improved from 3.5 to 0.5 in the LN group ( p = 0.01) and from 2.2 to 0.2 in the LGB group ( p = 0.003). There was no difference in the mean postoperative symptom scores between the groups ( p = 0.35). After surgery, mean LES resting pressures increased from 12.9 to 35.5 ( p = 0.003) in the LN group and from 23.6 to 29.7 ( p = 0.45) in the LGB group. There were no complications in either group. Results of this study show that laparoscopic gastric bypass and laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication are both effective in treating heartburn symptoms and objective acid reflux in morbidly obese patients. The health benefits of weight loss after laparoscopic gastric bypass should make this operation the procedure of choice in the morbidly obese patient with heartburn.",10.1007/s00464-002-8955-y,,,,241
585,Weight loss and effect on co-morbidities in the long-term after duodenal switch and gastric bypass: a population-based cohort study.,"Unsatisfactory weight loss is common after bariatric surgery in patients with super obesity (body mass index [BMI] â‰¥50 kg/m2). Unfortunately, this group of patients is increasing worldwide. The aim of this study was to compare long-term weight loss and effect on co-morbidities after duodenal switch (DS) and gastric bypass (RYGB) in super-obese patients. University hospital, Sweden, national cohort. This observational population-based cohort-study of primary DS and RYGB (BMI â‰¥48 kg/m2) in Sweden from 2007 to 2017 used data from 4 national registers. Baseline characteristics were used for propensity score matching (1 DS:4 RYGB). Weight loss was analyzed up until 5 years after surgery. Medication for diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, depression, and pain were analyzed up until 10 years after surgery. The study population consisted of 333 DS and 1332 RYGB, with 60.7% females averaging 38.5 years old and BMI 55.0 kg/m2 at baseline. DS resulted in a lower BMI at 5 years compared with RYGB, 32.2 Â± 5.5 and 37.8 Â± 7.3, respectively, (P < .01). DS reduced prevalence of diabetes and hypertension more than RYGB, while reduction in dyslipidemia was similar for both groups, during the 10-year follow-up. Both groups increased their use of antidepressants and a maintained a high use of opioids. This study indicates that super-obese patients have more favorable outcomes regarding weight loss and effect on diabetes and hypertension, after DS compared with RYGB.",10.1016/j.soard.2019.09.077,,,,242
1212,"Development of ulcer disease after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, incidence, risk factors, and patient presentation: a systematic review.","Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is the gold standard in bariatric surgery. A long-term complication can be marginal ulceration (MU) at the gastrojejunostomy. The mechanism of development is unclear and symptoms vary. Management and prevention is a continuous subject of debate. The aim was to assess the incidence, mechanism, symptoms, and management of MU after LRYGB by means of a systematic review. Forty-one studies with a total of 16,987 patients were included, 787 (4.6%) developed MU. The incidence of MU varied between 0.6 and 25%. The position and size of the pouch, smoking, and nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs usage are associated with the formation of MU. In most cases, MU is adequately treated with proton pump inhibitors, sometimes reoperation is required. Laparoscopic approach is safe and effective.",10.1007/s11695-013-1118-5,,,,243
216,Efficacy and safety of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in symptomatic patients following fundoplication failure: a meta-analysis.,"Revisional surgery may be required in a subset of patients who remain symptomatic despite undergoing laparoscopic fundoplication (LF) for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). While revisional LF (RLF) is feasible in these patients, laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) may serve as an alternative, although its efficacy and safety remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the outcomes of LRYGB in symptomatic patients following failed LF for GERD. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed databases were systematically searched for studies reporting LRYGB outcomes in symptomatic adults despite undergoing LF for GERD. Postoperative symptom resolution, recurrence of heartburn and dysphagia, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use, and body mass index (BMI) reduction were assessed to determine LRYGB efficacy. Postoperative morbidity and mortality were used to evaluate LRYGB safety. Twenty-two studies with 1523 patients were included. Pooled rates of symptom resolution, recurrence of heartburn and dysphagia, PPI use, morbidity, and mortality were 71.6% (95% CI 59.4-86.4), 15.6% (8.9-27.3), 20.7% (12.5-34.3), 29.6% (18.8-46.5), 39.5% (29.9-52.3), and 2.2% (1.2-4.0), respectively, following LRYGB. Similar rates were observed after RLF. However, BMI reduction was significantly greater after LRYGB compared with RLF (mean difference 6.1Â kg/m2, 4.8-7.4; pÂ <Â 0.0001). LRYGB resulted in symptom relief in a majority of patients, and proved comparable to RLF regarding symptom recurrence and PPI use. Morbidity and mortality following LRYGB also did not differ from RLF. However, LRYGB was associated with considerably greater weight loss relative to RLF. Therefore, LRYGB is efficacious and an acceptable revisional procedure in symptomatic GERD patients who have previously undergone LF.",10.1007/s10388-022-00969-8,,,,244
637,Bile acid changes after metabolic surgery are linked to improvement in insulin sensitivity.,"Metabolic surgery is associated with a prompt improvement in insulin resistance, although the mechanism of action remains unknown. The literature on bile acid changes after metabolic surgery is conflicting, and insulin sensitivity is generally assessed by indirect methods. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between improvement in insulin sensitivity and concentration of circulating bile acids after biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). This was a prospective observational study of nine patients who underwent BPD and six who had RYGB. Inclusion criteria for participation were a BMI in excess of 40â€‰kg/m2 , no previous diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and willingness to participate. Exclusion criteria were major endocrine diseases, malignancies and liver cirrhosis. Follow-up visits were carried out after a mean(s.d.) of 185Â·3(72Â·9) days. Fasting plasma bile acids were assessed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, and insulin sensitivity was measured by means of a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. A significant increase in all bile acids, as well as an amelioration of insulin sensitivity, was observed after metabolic surgery. An increase in conjugated secondary bile acids was significantly associated with an increase in insulin sensitivity. Only the increase in glycodeoxycholic acid was significantly associated with an increase in insulin sensitivity in analysis of individual conjugated secondary bile acids. Glycodeoxycholic acid might drive the improved insulin sensitivity after metabolic surgery.",10.1002/bjs.11208,,,,245
1593,Laparoscopic versus open gastric bypass in the treatment of morbid obesity: a randomized prospective study.,"The objective of the study was to compare the results of open versus laparoscopic gastric bypass in the treatment of morbid obesity. Gastric bypass is one of the most commonly acknowledged surgical techniques for the management of morbid obesity. It is usually performed as an open surgery procedure, although now some groups perform it via the laparoscopic approach. Between June 1999 and January 2002 we conducted a randomized prospective study in 104 patients diagnosed with morbid obesity. The patients were divided into 2 groups: 1 group with gastric bypass via the open approach (OGBP) comprising 51 patients, and 1 group with gastric bypass via the laparoscopic approach (LGBP) comprising 53 patients. The parameters compared were as follows: operating time, intraoperative complications, early (<30 days) and late (>30 days) postoperative complications, hospital stay, and short-term evolution of body mass index. Mean operating time was 186.4 minutes (125-290) in the LGBP group and 201.7 minutes (129-310) in the OGBP group (P < 0.05). Conversion to laparotomy was necessary in 8% of the LGBP patients. Early postoperative complications (<30 days) occurred in 22.6% of the LGBP group compared with 29.4% of the OGBP group, with no significant differences. Late complications (>30 days) occurred in 11% of the LGBP group compared with 24% of the OGBP group (P < 0.05). The differences observed between the 2 groups are the result of a high incidence of abdominal wall hernias in the OGBP group. Mean hospital stay was 5.2 days (1-13) in the LGBP group and 7.9 days (2-28) in the OGBP group (P < 0.05). Evolution of body mass index during a mean follow-up of 23 months was similar in both groups. LGBP is a good surgical technique for the management of morbid obesity and has clear advantages over OGBP, such as a reduction in abdominal wall complications and a shorter hospital stay. The midterm weight loss is similar with both techniques. One inconvenience is that LGBP has a more complex learning curve than other advanced laparoscopic techniques, which may be associated with an increase in postoperative complications.",10.1097/01.sla.0000120071.75691.1f,,,,246
1185,Control of hypertension after roux-en-y gastric bypass among obese diabetic patients.,"Hypertension is a common disorder in general practice and has a widely known association with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Low adhesion to clinical treatment may lead to poor results. Obesity surgery can bring early and relevant resolution rates of both morbidities. To describe hypertension evolution after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Descriptive observational study designed as a historical cohort of 90 subjects with hypertension and diabetes who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and were evaluated before and after surgery. It was observed a hypertension resolution rate of 85.6% along with markedly decrease in anti-hypertensive usage. Mean resolution time was 3.2 months. Resolution was associated with homeostasis model assessment - insulin resistance, preoperative fasting insulin, anti-hypertensive usage, hypertension time, body mass index and percentage of weight loss. Resolution of hypertension was not statistically associated with diabetes remission within this sample. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was a safe and effective therapeutic tool to achieve hypertension resolution in patients who also had diabetes mellitus.",10.1590/s0004-28032014000100005,,,,247
1079,Early Endocrine and Metabolic Changes After Bariatric Surgery in Grade III Morbidly Obese Patients: A Randomized Clinical Trial Comparing Sleeve Gastrectomy and Gastric Bypass.,"We compared the early endocrine and metabolic changes associated with sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and gastric bypass (GB) in grade III obese patients. Fifty morbidly obese patients were randomized into two groups on the basis of their position in the queue-group A comprised SG and group B was GB. Comparison between the two groups was based on clinical and laboratory variables such as fasting blood glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipids, albumin, and ferritin. Patients were assessed after 7, 14, 30, 60, and 90 days and additional laboratory tests were done on the 90(th) day. The following mean values were recorded for groups A and B, respectively: Age (years), 36.4 and 31.1; weight (kg), 123.2 and 128.3; and body mass index (BMI; kg/m(2)), 45.6 and 47.3. In the first postoperative week, group B showed a greater weight loss (P=0.047) that was not observed after 14, 30, 60, and 90 days (P>0.05). Group A had an average excess weight loss of 31.09â€‰kg compared to 32.69â€‰kg in group B (P=0.222). Glycemic control was better in group B (P=0.023), whereas the control of systemic arterial pressure was better in group A (P=0.026). There were no significant differences in early lipid control and micronutrient deficiencies between the two groups. SG and GB were equally effective in promoting weight loss after 90 days. However, whereas SG was associated with better early remission rates for hypertension, GB was more effective in fasting blood glucose control but not in HOMA-IR and HbA1c levels. There was no difference in the protein or vitamin deficiencies of the two groups.",10.1089/met.2014.0152,,,,248
182,Bariatric surgery in patients with obesity and end-stage renal disease.,"Bariatric surgery has been suggested as a treatment for obesity and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Although the number of bariatric surgeries in patients with ESRD is increasing, its safety and effectiveness in these patients are still controversial and the surgical method of choice in these patients is under debate. To compare the outcomes of bariatric surgery between patients with and without ESRD and to assess different methods of bariatric surgery in patients with ESRD. Meta-analysis. A comprehensive search was conducted in Web of Science and Medline (via Pubmed) until May 2022. Tow meta-analyses were performed: A) to compare bariatric surgery outcomes among patients with and without ESRD, and B) to compare outcomes of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in patients with ESRD. Using a random-effect model, odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for surgical and weight loss outcomes. Of 5895 articles, 6 studies were included in meta-analysis A and 8 studies in meta-analysis B. The risk of bias was moderate to serious among studies. Major postoperative complications (OR = 2.82; 95% CI = 1.66-4.77; P = .0001), reoperation (OR = 2.66; 95% CI = 1.99-3.56; P < .00001), readmission (OR = 2.37; 95% CI = 1.55-3.64; P < .0001), and in-hospital/90-d mortality (OR = 4.03; 95% CI = 1.80-9.03; P = .0007) were higher in patients with ESRD. Patients with ESRD also had a longer hospital stay (MD = 1.23; 95% CI = .32-2.14; P = .008). Bleeding, leakage, and total weight loss were comparable among groups. SG showed a 10% lower rate of overall complications and significantly shorter hospital stay than RYGB did. The quality of evidence was very low for the outcomes CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery in patients with ESRD seems to have higher rates of major complications and perioperative mortality than in patients without ESRD, but a comparable rate of overall complications. SG has fewer postoperative complications and could be the method of choice in these patients. These findings should be interpreted cautiously in light of the moderate to high risk of bias in most included studies.",10.1016/j.soard.2023.01.015,,,,249
381,The Choice of Gastric Bypass or Sleeve Gastrectomy for Patients Stratified by Diabetes Duration and Body Mass Index (BMI) level: Results from a National Registry and Meta-analysis.,"To determine whether sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) should be the optimal choice in patients stratified by diabetes duration and body mass index (BMI) level. Classification tree analysis was performed to identify the influential factors for surgical procedure selection in real setting. Meta-analyses stratified by influential factors were conducted to compare the complete diabetes remission rates between SG and RYGB. The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed when results from meta-analysis remain uncertain. Among 3198 bariatric procedures in China, 824 (73%) SGs and 191 (17%) RYGBs were performed in patients with T2DM. Diabetes duration with a cutoff value of 5 years and BMI level with 35.5 kg/m2 were identified as the influential factors. For patients with diabetes duration > 5 years, RYGB showed a significant higher complete diabetes remission rate than SG at 1 year: 0.52 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.46-0.58) versus 0.36 (95% CI: 0.30-0.42). For patients with diabetes duration â‰¤ 5 years and BMI â‰¥ 35.5 kg/m2, there was no significant difference between 2 procedures: 0.57 (95% CI: 0.43-0.71) for SG versus 0.66 (95% CI: 0.62-0.70) for RYGB. The cost-effectiveness ratios of SG and RYGB were 244.58 and 276.97 dollars per QALY, respectively. For patients with diabetes duration > 5 years, RYGB was the optimal choice with regard to achieving complete diabetes remission at 1 year after surgery. However, for patients with diabetes duration â‰¤ 5 years and BMI â‰¥ 35.5 kg/m2, SG appeared to provide a cost-effective choice.",10.1007/s11695-021-05459-x,,,,250
1127,Impact of roux-en Y gastric bypass surgery on prognostic factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus: meta-analysis and systematic review.,"Our aim is to clarify the features of complete type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remission in patients who undergo Roux-en Y gastric bypass surgery, to better determine factors affecting the outcome of T2DM surgery. A search was conducted for original studies on Medline, PubMed and Elsevier from inception until October 28, 2014. All of the articles included in this study were assessed with the application of predetermined selection criteria and were divided into two groups: Roux-en Y gastric bypass surgery for T2DM patients in remission or non-remission. The meta-analysis results demonstrated that fasting C-peptide values were significantly associated with increased remission (C-peptide: 95%CIâ€‰=â€‰0.2-1.0) whereas T2DM duration, patient age, preoperative insulin use, preoperative fasting blood glucose values and preoperative glycosylated haemoglobin values were significantly associated with reduced remission (T2DM duration: 95%CIâ€‰=â€‰-1.2 - -0.7; age: 95%CIâ€‰=â€‰-0.5 - -0.1; percentage of preoperative insulin users: odd ratioâ€‰=â€‰0.10, 95%CIâ€‰=â€‰0.07-0.15; preoperative fasting blood glucose: 95%CIâ€‰=â€‰-0.9 - -0.5; preoperative glycosylated haemoglobin: 95%CIâ€‰=â€‰-1.1 - -0.4). However, the results demonstrated that body mass index was not statistically different (body mass index: 95%CIâ€‰=â€‰-0.2-0.6). The results of the systematic review demonstrated that smaller waist circumference; lower total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein levels, increased higher high-density lipoprotein levels, shorter cardiovascular disease history and less preoperative prevalence of hypertension contribute to the increased postoperative remission rate. Better results are obtained in younger patients with less severe diabetes, a smaller waist circumference, higher preoperative high-density lipoprotein, lower preoperative total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein levels and fewer other complications of shorter durations.",10.1002/dmrr.2622,,,,251
523,Comparative effectiveness of bariatric surgeries in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus: A network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"A network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed to determine the hierarchies of different bariatric surgeries in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), in terms of diabetes remission and cardiometabolic outcomes. Seventeen RCTs and six bariatric surgeries, including single anastomosis (mini) gastric bypass (mini-GBP), biliopancreatic diversion without duodenal switch (BPD), laparoscopic-adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP), greater curvature plication (GCP) and nonsurgical treatments (NST) were included. Mini-GBP, BPD, LSG, RYGBP and LAGB (from best to worst), as compared with NST, were all significantly associated with the remission of T2DM. For the follow-up period > 3 years, BPD, mini-GBP, RYGBP and LSG (from best to worst) were significantly superior to NST in achieving the remission of T2DM. For secondary outcomes, the overall ranking for bariatric surgeries was RYGBP > BPD > LSG > LAGB after comprehensively weighting glucose, weight, systolic and diastolic pressure, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Mini-GBP has the greatest probability of achieving diabetes remission in adults with obesity and T2DM, yet BPD was the most effective in long-term diabetes remission. RYGBP appears to be the most favourable alternative treatment to manage patients with cardiometabolic conditions.",10.1111/obr.13030,,,,252
1317,Durability of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery: a meta-regression study.,"The present meta-regression pools data from reports of long-term follow-up (>2 years) to assess durability of the efficacy associated with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. Medline and PubMed searches for articles pertaining to long-term weight loss after RYGB surgery were performed. Various studies have consistently shown short-term (<2 years) efficacy of RYGB surgery for morbid obesity, corroborated by meta-analytic techniques. Relatively few studies have assessed efficacy over longer periods of time. This is the first meta-analysis to analyze long-term effects of RYGB surgery on weight loss. Twenty-two reports with a total of 4206 patient cases were included. Sixteen of the 22 studies had multiple follow-up times, ranging from 2 to 12.3 years (mean: 3.6 years). An inverse variance weighted model and meta-regression were used to generate the pooled percent mean excess weight loss (EWL) and the durability of EWL over time, respectively. Meta-regression did not reveal any significant change in EWL over time. Pooled mean EWL was 66.5%, and there was no significant association between EWL and length of follow-up. Pooling data from multiple studies meta-analytically revealed that weight loss after RYGB is maintained over the long-term. Further investigation would be necessary to ascertain similar durability in comorbidity reduction after RYGB surgery.",10.1097/SLA.0b013e3182565712,,,,253
1131,Predictors of short-term diabetes remission after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"A remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the major goals of the contemporary bariatric surgery. The goal of our study is to identify predictors of short-term postoperative diabetes remission in order to facilitate preoperative patient selection. Two hundred forty-five obese (body mass index (BMI) â‰¥35 kg/m2) T2DM subjects who underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) were followed up to 1 year after bariatric surgery. Diabetes remission was defined as hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) â‰¤6 % and fasting blood glucose (FBG) <100 mg/dl in absence of all diabetic medications. Twenty-six percent of the patients seen in f/u achieved complete remission at 1 year. Average Hba1c decreased from 8 to 6.7% and 6.4% after 6 and 12 months, respectively. Regression analysis showed that age (pâ€‰=â€‰0.01), number of diabetes complications (pâ€‰=â€‰0.03), family history of diabetes (pâ€‰=â€‰0.04), preoperative use of insulin (pâ€‰=â€‰0.04), and peri- and postoperative weight loss (pâ€‰=â€‰0.05, for both) were the best preoperative predictors of diabetes remission at 6 and 12 months (R(2)â€‰=â€‰0.3). Younger patients, with fewer diabetic complications, no family history of diabetes, not using insulin, and with greater peri- and postoperative weight loss were the best candidates to achieve a rapid diabetes remission after RYGB.",10.1007/s11695-014-1477-6,,,,254
1346,Effect of preoperative weight loss in bariatric surgical patients: a systematic review.,"The potential benefit of preoperative weight loss in patients undergoing bariatric surgery has led many bariatric surgeons to recommend an aggressive weight reduction regimen to their patients. Some surgeons might withhold bariatric procedures if a certain threshold of preoperative weight loss is not achieved. It is unclear whether this practice has any scientific evidence supporting it. Our study aimed to examine the current evidence surrounding this issue in a systematic review. The setting was a university hospital. A systematic search of multiple databases, including MEDLINE, Google Scholar, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and conference proceedings were reviewed, yielding a final total of 27 studies. Of the 27 studies, 7 were prospective studies (2 randomized controlled trials from the same patient population), 14 were retrospective studies (2 chart reviews from the same patient population), 1 was an editorial, and a number were conference presentations. A total of 17 trials, including approximately 4611 patients, deemed preoperative weight loss beneficial, and 10 studies, including 2075 patients, deemed preoperative weight loss to be of no benefit. The operative time was 12.5 minutes shorter for the preoperative weight loss patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. With regard to the effects of preoperative weight loss on postoperative weight loss, 9 studies (39%) reported a positive correlation, and 15 (62.5%) reported no benefit. Nine studies reporting perioperative complications (852 patients) revealed no difference in the complication rates, and 2 studies (1234 patients) suggested a significant decrease was associated with preoperative weight loss. This systematic review suggests little evidence is available to support or refute the routine use of preoperative weight reduction in bariatric surgery. Clearly, a large-scale, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial with sufficient power is necessary to clarify this significant aspect of preoperative care.",10.1016/j.soard.2011.08.011,,,,255
1221,Long-term results of a prospective comparison of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus a variant of biliopancreatic diversion in a non-superobese population (BMI 35-50 kg/m(2)).,"This study presents late results of a previously published 2-year prospective comparison between Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) versus biliopancreatic diversion with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (BPD-RYGBP) in an exclusively non-superobese population. From a cohort of 130 patients with a BMI of 35-50 kg/m(2), 65 were randomly selected to undergo RYGBP and 65 to BPD-RYGBP. All underwent follow-up evaluation at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively and every year thereafter. Follow-up at the eighth year was achieved in 60% of the BPD-RYGBP and in 58% of the RYGBP group (pâ€‰=â€‰1.00). Mean excess weight loss (EWL%), was significantly higher following BPD-RYGBP (76.89â€‰Â±â€‰1.53) as compared to RYGBP (67.17â€‰Â±â€‰1.43) (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0004). The mean success rate (percentage of patients with EWL% â‰¥50%) was significantly higher after BPD-RYGBP (95.85â€‰Â±â€‰1.01) than RYGBP (75.91â€‰Â±â€‰3.58) (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0001). No significant differences were observed for late non-metabolic complications. The incidence of anemia, iron deficiency, B12 deficiency, and low-ferritin levels was relatively high in both groups with not always significant differences. Severe protein malnutrition occurred in four patients (three BPD-RYGBP and one RYGBP) (pâ€‰=â€‰0.37). In only one BPD-RYGBP patient (1.54%) was revision surgery to RYGBP necessary, due to recurrent episodes of hypoproteinemia. The remaining patients were treated successfully with total parenteral nutrition and nutritional counseling. Late results presented in this paper agree with the previously published 2-year results of the same patient cohort. Although both procedures are safe and effective, BPD-RYGBP seems to prevail in terms of successful weight loss without a significantly higher incidence of metabolic and non-metabolic complications.",10.1007/s11695-013-1081-1,,,,256
930,"Reversal to normal anatomy after failed gastric bypass: systematic review of indications, techniques, and outcomes.","Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the most common and most effective procedures performed to combat obesity and obesity-related metabolic disease. In a small proportion of patients, however, complications may necessitate the attempted reversal of RYGB to normal anatomy. The indications for this procedure, as well as technique, complication rate, and success in resolving symptoms are not clearly defined. To assess current literature describing outcomes after reversal of RYGB. A systematic search of online databases was conducted. Two independent researchers identified and extracted data for studies describing outcomes after RYGB reversal surgery. Indications, techniques, and outcomes were compared, with results pooled where possible. Eight articles were included in the final data synthesis, incorporating data for 46 patients. Reversal was undertaken due to metabolic, physical, nutritional, or other complications. All successfully underwent RYGB reversal with no reported mortality. Surgical technique varied greatly across the included studies. Postoperative morbidity was high, with 42% suffering complications (56% of which were major). Symptom relief or improvement was achieved in 82% of cases. Reversal of RYGB may be undertaken for a variety of indications after RYGB. Though this may successfully eliminate or improve symptoms in a large proportion of patients, the risk of morbidity is high. Surgery should be undertaken after careful patient selection and in appropriately skilled centers only.",10.1016/j.soard.2016.01.030,,,,257
771,A dissonance-based intervention for women post roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery aiming at improving quality of life and physical activity 24Â months after surgery: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery is the most common bariatric procedure in Sweden and results in substantial weight loss. Approximately one year post-surgery weight regain for these patient are common, followed by a decrease in health related quality of life (HRQoL) and physical activity (PA). Our aim is to investigate the effects of a dissonance-based intervention on HRQoL, PA and other health-related behaviors in female RYGB patients 24Â months after surgery. We are not aware of any previous RCT that has investigated the effects of a similar intervention targeting health behaviors after RYGB. The ongoing RCT, the ""WELL-GBP""-trial (wellbeing after gastric bypass), is a dissonance-based intervention for female RYGB patients conducted at five hospitals in Sweden. The participants are randomized to either control group receiving usual follow-up care, or to receive an intervention consisting of four group sessions three months post-surgery during which a modified version of the Stice dissonance-based intervention model is used. The sessions are held at the hospitals, and topics discussed are PA, eating behavior, social and intimate relationships. All participants are asked to complete questionnaires measuring HRQoL and other health-related behaviors and wear an accelerometer for seven days before surgery and at six months, one year and two years after surgery. The intention to treat and per protocol analysis will focus on differences between the intervention and control group from pre-surgery assessments to follow-up assessments at 24Â months after RYGB. Patients' baseline characteristics are presented in this protocol paper. A total of 259 RYGB female patients has been enrolled in the ""WELL-GBP""-trial, of which 156 women have been randomized to receive the intervention and 103 women to control group. The trial is conducted within a Swedish health care setting where female RYGB patients from diverse geographical areas are represented. Our results may, therefore, be representative for female RYGB patients in the country as a whole. If the intervention is effective, implementation within the Swedish health care system is possible within the near future. The trial was registered on February 23th 2015 with registration number ISRCTN16417174 .",10.1186/s12893-018-0358-7,,,,258
295,The future of bariatric surgery research: A worldwide mapping of registered trials.,"The bariatric surgery (BS) research landscape is a continuous evolving. Since the first described procedure, numerous different techniques have been developed by surgical teams. In this context, we conducted a systematic mapping of upcoming randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in BS for people with obesity. In June 2021, we performed a systematic review of RCTs evaluating BS versus another surgical procedure or versus a medical control group, through a search in ClinicalTrials.gov. There was no restriction on outcomes for study selection. A total of 62 RCTs were included, totaling 10,800 potential individuals to be included, with planned Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy surgeries the most common. The median number of patients planned to be enrolled is 78 (IQR: 50-143). Mean follow-up time is 12â€‰months in 55% of trials and 4Â years or more in 23%. The most frequent (81% of RCTs) outcomes to be investigated are obesity-related diseases with the study of type 2 diabetes, followed by weight loss, quality of life, and surgical complications. The rising number of BS procedures around the world has been followed by a subsequent surge in BS research. An increase in interest is observed in outcomes such as obesity-related diseases, intermediate metabolic markers, quality of life, and body composition.",10.1111/obr.13433,,,,259
567,"Cholelithiasis after bariatric surgery, incidence, and prophylaxis: randomized controlled trial.","Rapid weight loss is associated with a high incidence of cholelithiasis. To identify the incidence of gallstone formation after weight loss surgery and to detect the efficacy of 6 months regimen of prophylactic Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). RCT included a total of 1530 morbid obese patients who were subjected to either laparoscopic one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), or greater curve plication (GCP). Patients with previous or concomitant cholecystectomy and missed follow-up were excluded, leaving 1432 patients to analyze. They were randomly allocated into two groups receiving either UDCA or placebo with a minimum follow-up of one year for assessment of cholelithiasis and weight loss. The overall incidence of cholelithiasis after surgery was 9.7%. There was a significant decrease in the incidence of gallstone formation from 22% in placebo to 6.5% in treated group with UDCA. The mean percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) was significantly higher in those who develop gallstones than others. Of those developing gallstones, there was 64.7 % with SG versus 28.1% and 7.2% in OAGB and GCP, respectively, which is statistically significant. NNT to prevent cholelithiasis is six, AR% is 70.4%, and RR is 3.4%. Cholelithiasis after SG and OAGB was higher than GCP. %EWL was rapid and higher in OAGB and SG contributing to the higher rate of symptomatic cholelithiasis and could be predictive for post-bariatric cholelithiasis. A 6-month use of UDCA is an effective prophylaxis decreasing gallstone formation after bariatric surgery at short-term follow-up.",10.1007/s00464-019-07323-7,,,,260
932,Influence of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass on the Hepatocellular Function and Bile Flow of Obese Patients Assessed by Scintigraphy with DISIDA.,"Obesity is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is improved by bariatric surgery. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy with 99m.-Tc diisopropylacetanilido iminodiacetic acid (99mTc-DISIDA) has proved to be highly effective for the assessment of bile flow, representing an indirect measurement of hepatocyte and cholangiocyte function. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on bile flow in obese subjects by hepatobiliary scintigraphy. This study was conducted in a public university hospital in Brazil. Twenty obese patients and five nonobese patients (with no hepatic or biliary disease) were studied. The obese patients were submitted to anthropometric evaluation and biochemical exams when they arrived at the service, during the immediate preoperative period and 3, 6, and 12Â months after surgery. They were also submitted to abdominal ultrasound and hepatobiliary scintigraphy with 99mTc-DISIDA during the preoperative period and 12Â months after RYGB. Tmax (time of maximum marker uptake) and T1/2 (half time between peak uptake and disappearance of the marker) were determined and compared between obese patients and controls, before and after surgery. The results were compared to those obtained with an intraoperative liver biopsy. A weight loss of 12.2â€‰Â±â€‰4.3Â % was observed during preparation for surgery, and a loss of 30.4â€‰Â±â€‰5.6Â % was observed 1Â year after RYGB. Ultrasound hepatic analysis revealed some degree of NAFLD in the operated patients. Obese patients showed a prolonged T1/2 compared to control, with a reduction to normal levels after RYGB.

673,IMPACT OF WEIGHT LOSS TRAJECTORY FOLLOWING RANDOMIZATION TO BARIATRIC SURGERY ON LONG-TERM DIABETES GLYCEMIC AND CARDIOMETABOLIC PARAMETERS.,"Objective: It is unclear whether acute weight loss or the chronic trajectory of weight loss after bariatric surgery is associated with long-term type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) glycemic improvement. This ancillary study of the Surgical Treatment and Medications Potentially Eradicate Diabetes Efficiently (STAMPEDE) trial aimed to answer this question. Methods: In STAMPEDE, 150 patients with T2DM were randomized to bariatric surgery, and 96 had 5-year follow-up. Data post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB, n = 49) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG, n = 47) were analyzed. We defined percent weight loss in the first year as negative percent decrease from baseline weight to lowest weight in the first year. Percent weight regain was positive percent change from lowest weight in the first year to fifth year. Weight change was then correlated with cardiometabolic (CM) and glycemic outcomes at 5 years using Spearman rank correlations and multivariate analysis. Results: In both RYGB and SG, less weight loss in the first year positively correlated with higher 5-year glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (RYGB, Î² = +0.13; P<.001 and SG, Î² = 0.14; P<.001). In SG, greater weight regain from nadir positively correlated with higher HbA1c (Î² = 0.06; P = .02), but not in RYGB. Reduced first-year weight loss was also correlated with increased 5-year triglycerides (Î² = 1.81; P = .01), but not systolic blood pressure. Weight regain did not correlate with CM outcomes. Conclusion: Acute weight loss may be more important for T2DM glycemic control following both RYGB and SG as compared with weight regain. Clinicians should aim to assist patients with achieving maximal weight loss in the first year post-op to maximize long-term health of patients.

127,Safety and efficacy of LA-ERCP procedure following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Rapid weight loss following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) translates to an increased need for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) intervention. Laparoscopically Assisted Transgastric ERCP (LA-ERCP) has emerged to address the issue of accessing the excluded stomach. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LA-ERCP procedure following RYGB. The Cochrane, EMBASE, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, Daily and Epub databases were searched from inception to May 2022 using the PRISMA guidelines. Eligible studies reported participants older than 18Â years who underwent the LA-ERCP procedure, following RYGB, and outcomes of patients. 27 unique studies met the inclusion criteria with 1283 patients undergoing 1303 LA-ERCP procedures. 81.9% of the patients were female and the mean age was 52.18â€‰Â±â€‰13.38Â years. The rate of concurrent cholecystectomy was 33.6%. 90.9% of procedures were undertaken for a biliary indication. The mean time between RYGB and LA-ERCP was 89.19Â months. The most common intervention performed during the LA-ERCP was a sphincterotomy (94.3%). Mean total operative time was 130.48Â min. Mean hospital length of stay was 2.697Â days. Technical success was 95.3%, while clinical success was 93.8%. 294 complications were recorded with a 20.6% complication rate. The most frequent complications encountered were pancreatitis (6.8%), infection (6.1%), bleeding (3.4%), and perforation (2.5%). Rate of conversion to open laparotomy was 7%. This meta-analysis presents preliminary evidence to suggest the safety and efficacy of LA-ERCP procedure following RYGB. Further investigations are warranted to evaluate the long-term efficacy of this procedure using studies with long-term patient follow-up.",10.1007/s00464-023-10276-7,,,,263
154,Impact of Preoperative Psychiatric Profile in Bariatric Surgery on Long-term Weight Outcome.,"Conflicting results have been reported regarding the predictive value of preoperative psychological assessment and weight outcome after bariatric surgery. This might be attributed to different factors affecting early weight loss and long-term weight loss. Herein, we investigated whether preoperative psychiatric profile was associated with preoperative BMI and with both early (1Â year) and long-term (5Â years) weight loss after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Prospective observational cohort study of patients undergoing RYGB between 2013 and 2019. Symptoms related to anxiety, depression, eating disorder, and alcohol use disorders were assessed by employing validated, specific psychometric tests (STAI-S/T, BDI-II, BITE, AUDIT-C) prior to surgery. Pre-operative BMI, early weight loss (1Â year), and long-term weight evolution (up to 5Â years) were registered. Two hundred thirty six patients (81% women) were included in the present study. Linear longitudinal mixed model showed a significant effect of preoperative high anxiety (STAI-S) on long-term weight outcome, after controlling for gender, age and type 2 diabetes. Patient with high preoperative anxiety score regained weight faster than those experiencing low anxiety (each year percent excess BMI loss (%EBMIL)â€‰-â€‰4.02%,â€‰Â±â€‰1.72, pâ€‰=â€‰0.021). No other pre-operative psychiatric symptoms have been shown to have an impact on long-term weight loss. In addition, no significant association was found between any of the pre-operative psychiatric variables and pre-operative BMI, or early weight loss (%EBMIL) at 1-year post-RYGB. Herein we identified high anxiety score (STAI-S) as a predictor for long-term weight regain. Thus, long-term psychiatric surveillance of these patients and the development of tailored management tools could serve as a means to prevent weight regain.",10.1007/s11695-023-06595-2,,,,264
744,Preoperative administration of Omega-3 fatty acids on postoperative pain and acute-phase reactants in patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: A randomized clinical trial.,"The term ""Immunonutrition"" (IMN) describes the enteral administration of certain substrates with a theoretical immunomodulating function. From all the elements conforming these IMN formulas, Omega-3 fatty acids (O3FA) are hypothesized to be the most important component for immunomodulation, with increased anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect. A prospective randomized clinical trial of all the patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was performed. Patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups: those patients receiving a preoperative balanced energy high-protein formula (Control Group) and those ones who received the same preoperative nutritional formula enriched with O3FA (Experimental Group). In both groups, there was a restriction to 900Â Kcal/day. Nutritional intervention started 10 days before surgery and was maintained up to 8Â h before the surgical act. Preoperative weight loss, postoperative pain, complications and acute phase reactants were investigated. 40 patients were included in the study, 20 in each group. Preoperative excess weight loss (EWL) with the prescribed treatment was 10.6Â Â±Â 7.7% in Control Group and 14.1Â Â±Â 5.8% in the Experimental Group (pÂ =Â 0.024). Mean postoperative pain was 25Â Â±Â 9.2Â mm in Control group and 10,9Â Â±Â 4,4Â mm in Experimental Group (pÂ =Â 0.015). CRP determined 24Â h after surgery was significantly lower in the Experimental Group than in the Control Group. There were not significant differences in complications, mortality or readmission rates between groups. The use of a nutritional supplement enriched with O3FA is associated with a greater preoperative weight loss, reduced postoperative pain and decreased postoperative levels of C reactive protein.",10.1016/j.clnu.2018.07.026,,,,265
916,Risk factors for complications of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Although bariatric procedures are considered safe, yet still they involve a risk of possible perioperative complications. Identification of risk factors for complications would allow for appropriate preoperative optimization of the patient, as well as reasonable postoperative care and early diagnosis and treatment of possible complications. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors for perioperative complications after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of patients operated for morbid obesity. Regarding postoperative complications defined as adverse events occurring within 30 days of the procedure. Factors associated with patient characteristics and those related to the surgical procedure were determined. 408 patients met inclusion criteria and were submitted to surgical treatment. LSG and LRYGB were performed in 233 and 175 patients, respectively. Complications were observed in 30 (7.3%) patients. The maximum preoperative body weight and BMI, as well as body weight and BMI on the day of surgery were associated with increased complication rate. The type of the procedure did not influence perioperative complications (LRYGB vs. LSG; OR: 1.14; CI: 0.53-2.44; pÂ =Â 0.74). Although operative time statistically significantly increased the risk of complications, it did not seem clinically relevant (OR: 1.01; CI: 1.00-1.02; pÂ =Â 0.003). An increase in the number of stapler firings used significantly increased complication rate only in LSG group. Longer duration of LSG and the increase in the number of stapler firings used during LSG should alert a surgeon to an increased risk of postoperative complications. In patients submitted to LRYGB the risk of possible complications increases with BMI.",10.1016/j.ijsu.2016.12.012,,,,266
852,Cost and Health Care Utilization Implications of Bariatric Surgery Versus Intensive Lifestyle and Medical Intervention for Type 2 Diabetes.,"The aim of this study was to compare the cost and health care utilization of patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) randomized into either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery or an intensive lifestyle and medical intervention (ILMI). This analysis (Nâ€‰=â€‰745) is based on 2-year follow-up of a small randomized controlled trial (RCT); adult patients with obesity and T2DM were recruited between 2011 and 2012 from Kaiser Permanente Washington. Comparisons were made for patients randomized into either RYGB (Nâ€‰=â€‰15) or ILMI (Nâ€‰=â€‰17). There were no significant cost savings for RYGB versus ILMI patients through the follow-up years. Pharmacy cost was lower for RYGB versus ILMI patients by about $900 in year 2 versus year 0; however, inpatient and emergency room costs were higher for surgery patients in follow-up years relative to year 0. Median total cost for nonrandomized patients was higher in year 0 and in year 2 compared to randomized patients. Bariatric surgery is not cost saving in the short term. Moreover, the costs of patients who enter into RCTs of RYGB may differ from the costs of those who do not enter RCTs, suggesting use of caution when using such data to draw inferences about the general population with obesity.",10.1002/oby.21927,,,,267
66,Nonsurgical risk factors for marginal ulcer following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 cohort studies.,"Marginal ulcer (MU) is a common complication of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB). The primary goal of this meta-analysis was to identify potential risk factors for MU post-RYGB. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on four databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library) to identify articles published from inception to 23 May 2023 that reported risk factors linked to ulcer occurrence post-RYGB. Hazard Ratio (HR) and Odds Ratio (OR) with respective 95% CI were calculated to estimate the impact of selected risk factors on MU. The risk factors were evaluated through multivariate analyses. The estimated risk factors were subjected to a random-effects model. Subgroup analysis based on study baseline characteristics and leave-one-out sensitivity analysis were also performed to investigate the potential sources of heterogeneity and assess the robustness of the findings. Herein, 14 observational studies involving 77Â 250 patients were included. Diabetes, smoking, and steroid use were identified to be risk factors of MU, with pooled ORs of (1.812; 95% CI: 1.226-2.676; P =0.003), (3.491; 95% CI: 2.204-5.531; P< 0.001), and (2.804; 95% CI: 1.383-5.685; P =0.004), respectively. Other risk factors, such as alcohol consumption, male sex, and PPI use, were deemed not significant due to differences in data acquisition and effect estimates. Diabetes, smoking, and steroid use were identified as independent risk factors of MU. Enhancing awareness of these identified risk factors will lead to more effective preoperative prevention and targeted postoperative interventions for patients undergoing RYGB.",10.1097/JS9.0000000000001042,,,,268
1457,Surgery for obesity.,"Bariatric (weight loss) surgery for obesity is considered when other treatments have failed. The effects of the available bariatric procedures compared with medical management and with each other are uncertain. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003 and previously updated in 2005. To assess the effects of bariatric surgery for obesity. Studies were obtained from computerized searches of multiple electronic bibliographic databases, supplemented with searches of reference lists and consultation with experts in obesity research. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different surgical procedures, and RCTs, controlled clinical trials and prospective cohort studies comparing surgery with non-surgical management for obesity. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked independently by two reviewers. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality. Twenty six studies were included. Three RCTs and three prospective cohort studies compared surgery with non-surgical management, and 20 RCTs compared different bariatric procedures. The risk of bias of many trials was uncertain; just five had adequate allocation concealment. A meta-analysis was not appropriate.Surgery results in greater weight loss than conventional treatment in moderate (body mass index greater than 30) as well as severe obesity. Reductions in comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension, also occur. Improvements in health-related quality of life occurred after two years, but effects at ten years are less clear.Surgery is associated with complications, such as pulmonary embolism, and some postoperative deaths occurred.Five different bariatric procedures were assessed, but some comparisons were assessed by just one trial. The limited evidence suggests that weight loss following gastric bypass is greater than vertical banded gastroplasty or adjustable gastric banding, but similar to isolated sleeve gastrectomy and banded gastric bypass. Isolated sleeve gastrectomy appears to result in greater weight loss than adjustable gastric banding. Evidence comparing vertical banded gastroplasty with adjustable gastric banding is inconclusive. Data on the comparative safety of the bariatric procedures was limited.Weight loss and quality of life were similar between open and laparoscopic surgery. Conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery may occur. Surgery is more effective than conventional management. Certain procedures produce greater weight loss, but data are limited. The evidence on safety is even less clear. Due to limited evidence and poor quality of the trials, caution is required when interpreting comparative safety and effectiveness.",10.1002/14651858.CD003641.pub3,,,,269
1545,Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus a variant of biliopancreatic diversion in a non-superobese population: prospective comparison of the efficacy and the incidence of metabolic deficiencies.,"In the non-superobese population, an agreement has not been made as to the optimal bariatric operation. The present study reports the results of a prospective comparison of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) and a variant of biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) in a non-superobese population. From a cohort of 130 patients with BMI 35 to 50 kg/m(2), 65 patients were randomly selected to undergo RYGBP and 65 to undergo BPD. All patients underwent complete follow-up evaluation at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively and every year thereafter. Patients in both groups have completed their second postoperative year. Mean % excess weight loss (%EWL) was significantly better after BPD at all time periods (12 months, P=0.0001 and 24 months, P=0.0003), and the %EWL was >50% in all BPD patients compared to 88.7% in the RYGBP patients at 2-year follow-up. No statistically significant differences were observed between the 2 groups in early and late non-metabolic complications. Hypoalbuminemia occurred in only 1 patient (1.5%) after RYGBP and in 6 patients after BPD (9.2%). Only 1 patient from each group was hospitalized and received total parenteral nutrition. Glucose intolerance, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia and sleep apnea completely resolved in all patients in both groups, although mean total cholesterol level was significantly lower in BPD patients at the second year follow-up (t-test, P<0.0001). Diabetes completely resolved in all BPD patients and in 7 of the 10 diabetic RYGBP patients. Both RYGBP and BPD were safe and effective procedures when offered to non-superobese patients. Weight loss after BPD was consistently better than that after RYGBP, as was the resolution of diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. Because the nutritional deficiencies that occurred following this type of BPD were not severe and were not significantly different between the 2 operations, both may be offered to non-superobese patients, keeping in mind the severity and type of preoperative co-morbidities as well as the desired weight loss.",10.1381/096089206776327251,,,,270
784,The effect of metabolic surgery on nonobese patients (BMI<30 kg/m2) with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review.,"The influence of metabolic surgery on the glucose and lipid profiles of nonobese body mass index<30 kg/m2 patients with type 2 diabetes, particularly the effect â‰¥1 year, remains unknown. PubMed and Ovid Embase were used. University hospitals. In total, 21 studies including 921 patients were examined in this systematic review, the results of which revealed decrease in body mass index, waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin A1C, fasting C-peptide, fasting insulin, homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistance index, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. An increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was also observed. The diabetes remission rates ranged from 13.3% to 90.2% according to 20 studies. The incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding ranged from 1% to 10% according to 9 studies. Four studies reported anemia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or one-anastomosis gastric bypass, with the incidence ranging from 8% to 33%. Nonobese patients can achieve improvements in weight-related indices and glucose and lipid profiles in the short and medium term after metabolic surgery; however, the complications of metabolic surgery warrant further attention.",10.1016/j.soard.2018.02.013,,,,271
120,Long-term Follow-up 15 Years After Duodenal Switch or Gastric Bypass for Super Obesity: a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"In super obesity, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) may be insufficient why some surgeons advocate biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD/DS), a more malabsorptive procedure. There is a paucity of evidence regarding results beyond 10Â years, especially after BPD/DS. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to compare the long-term outcome of BPD/DS, and RYGB in patients with super obesity, i.e., body mass index (BMI)â€‰>â€‰50Â kg/m2. This is a 13- to 17-year follow-up study of a single-center, single-blinded randomized trial in which 47 patients (BMIâ€‰>â€‰48 and eligible for bariatric surgery) were randomized 1:1 to BPD/DS and RYGB (25 men, 24 BPD/DS, 39.1â€‰Â±â€‰9.9Â years, BMI 54.5â€‰Â±â€‰6.1Â kg/m2). The primary outcome was weight loss. The study was financed by Swedish governmental funding of clinical research (ALF). ISRCTN10940791. Thirty-four (18 BPD/DS) of the living 42 patients (81.0%) participated. BPD/DS resulted in higher BMI loss (20.4â€‰Â±â€‰7.9 vs. 12.4â€‰Â±â€‰8.6, pâ€‰=â€‰.008) and higher percent of total body weight loss (37.5%â€‰Â±â€‰12.2 vs. 22.8%â€‰Â±â€‰14.8, pâ€‰=â€‰.004). BPD/DS was associated with lower fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) as well as lower hemoglobin. Adverse events were more common after BPD/DS (2.7 vs. 0.9 per patient, pâ€‰=â€‰.004). The global assessment tool BAROS (Bariatric Analysis and Reporting Outcome System) demonstrated superior scores for BPD/DS (pâ€‰=â€‰.047). When compared to RYGB, BPD/DS results in superior weight loss and metabolic control as well as superior BAROS score, however, at the cost of more adverse events.",10.1007/s11695-023-06767-0,,,,272
1417,"Aerobic endurance training improves weight loss, body composition, and co-morbidities in patients after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.","One of the most effective treatments of patients with morbid obesity is laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Sudden weight loss after RYGB for morbid obesity can result in a concurrent decrease in the lean body mass. However, the long-term results (weight reduction and reduced co-morbidities) depend on the postoperative long-term therapy. Aerobic physical exercise (APE) has been considered conservative treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of APE on weight loss, body composition, and co-morbidities in patients after laparoscopic RYGB. The study was performed at a university hospital in Germany. A total of 60 consecutive morbidly obese patients underwent laparoscopic RYGB. The patients were prospectively randomized into a low-exercise group (APE 1 time for 1 hr/wk) or a multiple-exercise group (APE 2 times for 1 hr/wk). The following prospective data were collected: age, gender, length of hospital stay, operative details, co-morbidities, postoperative complications, initial body weight and height, postoperative weight, and body composition. The patients' body composition was assessed every 8 weeks during the 24-month follow-up period. The average body mass index (52 kg/m(2)) and other baseline characteristics were distributed equally in the 2 groups. No major complications and no significant differences in the minor complications were found postoperatively between the 2 groups. The multiple exercise group had a significantly more rapid reduction of body mass index, excess weight loss, and fat mass compared with the low-exercise group. The initial loss of body cell mass and lean body mass was significantly lower in the multiple exercise group and was regained more rapidly in the low-exercise group. In addition, the multiple exercise group showed significantly earlier resolution or improvement of co-morbidities. APE positively influenced weight loss, body composition, and co-morbidity resolution after RYGB for obesity. Additional controlled studies and longer follow-up are needed to confirm these positive findings.",10.1016/j.soard.2010.01.006,,,,273
994,Meta-analysis of hand-sewn versus mechanical gastrojejunal anastomosis during laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is one of the most performed bariatric procedures in treating morbid obesity. There is no consensus on which technique used for gastrojejunal anastomosis is optimal. The meta-analysis aimed to solve the issue by comparing hand-sewn with mechanical gastrojejunostomy during LRYGB for morbid obesity. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Google Scholar and Research Gate were searched (from inception to April 2016). Primary outcome was operation time. Secondary outcomes were postoperative complications (anastomotic leak, stricture, bleeding, marginal ulcer and wound infection), percent excess weight loss during one-year follow-up, reoperation, and postoperative hospital stay. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. Twelve trials were included comprising 13,626 patients (3309 hand-sewn vs. 6791 circular vs. 3526 linear). There was no difference in operation time when hand-sewn anastomosis was compared with mechanical gastrojejunostomy (MD,Â -6.00; 95% confidence interval (CI),Â -34.85 to 22.85; PÂ =Â 0.68), circular stapled anastomosis (MD,Â -5.24; 95% CI,Â -32.71 to 22.24; PÂ =Â 0.71) or linear stapled anastomosis (MD, - 3.75; 95% CI,Â -64.81 to 57.31; PÂ =Â 0.90). Hand-sewn anastomosis had significantly lower incidence rate of postoperative bleeding (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.31-0.74; PÂ =Â 0.001) and wound infection (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.08-0.45; PÂ =Â 0.0002) than circular stapled anastomosis; there were no significant differences in the other secondary outcome. And there were no significant differences in all the comparable outcomes between hand-sewn anastomosis and linear stapled anastomosis. This meta-analysis revealed no significant differences between mechanical and hand-sewn anastomosis except for greater incidence rates of postoperative bleeding and wound infection with the use of circular staplers. Besides, more trials with adequate power are required and a cost analysis also worth trying. REGISTRATION NO. CRD42015020025.",10.1016/j.ijsu.2016.04.024,,,,274
1229,Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy as revisional procedure after adjustable gastric band--a systematic review.,"The adjustable gastric band (L)AGB gained popularity as a weight loss procedure. However, long-term results are disappointing; many patients need revision to laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). The purpose of this study was to assess morbidity, mortality, and results of these two revisional procedures. Fifteen LRYGB studies with a total of 588 patients and eight LSG studies with 286 patients were included. The reason for revision was insufficient weight loss or weight regain in 62.2 and 63.9% in LRYGB and LSG patients. Short-term complications occurred in 8.5 and 15.7% and long-term complications in 8.9 and 2.5%. Reoperation was performed in 6.5 and 3.5%. Revision to LRYGB or LSG after (L)AGB is feasible and relatively safe. Complication rate is higher than in primary procedures.",10.1007/s11695-013-1058-0,,,,275
411,Sleeve Gastrectomy Versus Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in the Elderly: 1-Year Preliminary Outcomes in a Randomized Trial (BASE Trial).,"Despite the increasing prevalence of elderly obese patients, bariatric surgery remains controversial in this population. Recent publications have focused on perioperative safety, but few studies have addressed clinical outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate 1-year outcomes of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) compared to laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) in patients 65 years or older. Thirty-six elderly obese patients were recruited for an open-label randomized trial from September 2017 to May 2019, comparing LSG to LRYGB. One-year outcomes were evaluated based on weight loss, functionality, and control of clinical conditions. The median age (67 Ã— 67 years; p=0.67) and initial body mass index (BMI) (46.3 Ã— 51.3 kg/m2; p=0.28) were similar between groups. Preoperative BMI (after weight loss pre-operative treatment) was higher in LRYGB group (41.9 Ã— 47.6 kg/m2; p= 0.03). After 12 months, EWL and TWL were higher in LRYGB group (60 Ã— 68%; p=0.04; 24.9 Ã— 31.4%; p<0.01). HbA1c reduction was higher after LRYGB (-1.1 Ã— -0.5%; p<0.01) as well as LDL control (-27.5 Ã— +11.5 mg/dL p= 0.02). No difference was noted between LRYGB and LSG concerning hypertension control, triglycerides, HDL, and functionality.

470,"Types, Safety, and Efficacy of Limb Distalization for Inadequate Weight Loss After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis With a Call for Standardized Terminology.","Comprehensive classification and evaluation of the outcome of limb distalization (LD) for inadequate weight loss after roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB). Limb distalization is a revisional malabsorptive procedure for the management of inadequate weight loss after RYGB. Multiple studies with small sample sizes reported the outcome of LD. This meta-analysis aims to reach a higher level of evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of the procedure. A systematic search, including all studies on LD for management of inadequate weight loss after RYGB. The search engines included were PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and EBSCOhost. Fourteen studies were included. The pooled estimates of the mid-term percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL), diabetic, and hypertension remission were 50.8%, 69.9%, and 59.8%, respectively. The rate of surgical revision for the management of protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) was 17.1%. The %EWL was significantly higher with older age and good response to index surgery (P = 0.01, 0.04, respectively). Less total alimentary limb length was not associated with better %EWL (P = 0.9), but it was significantly associated with severe PEM (P = 0.01). LD has an encouraging rate of resolution of comorbidities. A judicious patient selection is essential for better weight loss after LD. Type I LD with total alimentary limb length â‰¥350â€Šcm was associated with less risk of malnutrition. PEM is a life-threatening complication that may require revisional surgery years after LD. Future studies on LD, adopting standardized surgical practice and terminology, will allow a more conclusive assessment of the outcome of the procedure.",10.1097/SLA.0000000000004485,,,,277

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery has many beneficial metabolic effects, but the full impact on plasma lipids has not been clearly defined. A systematic review of electronic databases (Ovid; Medline; PubMed; Embase) between 1960 and March 2012 was performed using search terms including the following: obesity surgery, bariatric surgery, gastric bypass, cholesterol, lipids, triglycerides and non-esterified fatty acids. A total of 2442 manuscripts were screened. Papers with paired plasma lipid levels around RYGB surgery were included. Exclusions included the following: editorials, dual publications, nâ€‰<â€‰10, resulting in 75 papers of relevance. A meta-analysis was performed of the effect of RYGB surgery upon plasma lipids at different time points up to 4 years following surgery, using a random effects model. Paired data were available for 7815 subjects around RYGB surgery for morbid obesity with a baseline BMI 48 kg/m(2) (nâ€‰=â€‰2331). There was a reduction in plasma total cholesterol and LDL-C from 1 month up to 4 years post-RYGB (pâ€‰<â€‰0.00001, pâ€‰<â€‰0.00001). Following RYGB, HDL-C increased from 1 year onwards (pâ€‰<â€‰0.00001), and triglyceride levels were reduced postoperatively from 3 months up to 4 years (pâ€‰<â€‰0.00001). NEFA levels were increased at 1 month postoperatively (pâ€‰=â€‰0.003), but from 3 months onwards did not differ from preoperative levels (pâ€‰=â€‰0.07). RYGB surgery reverses the dyslipidaemia of obesity. These findings support the use of RYGB in the management of high cardiovascular risk lipid profiles in morbid obesity.",10.1007/s11695-015-1829-x,,,,278

210,"Resolution of diabetes, gastrointestinal symptoms, and self-reported dietary intake after gastric bypass versus sleeve gastrectomy: a randomized study.","There is a lack of randomized studies examining diabetes remission and dietary intake between patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) versus sleeve gastrectomy (SG). To examine longitudinal differences in diabetes resolution, dietary intake, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) randomized to either RYGB or SG and according to remission of T2D. Four hospitals in Sweden, 2 of which are university hospitals. Dietary intake and GI symptoms were calculated from questionnaires and morphometric differences between surgical methods and T2D remission were compared using the Student t test, effect size (ES) for parametric parameters, and Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric parameters. Five years after RYGB or SG there was no significant difference in the rate of remission of T2D between RYGB and SG (43% versus 20%, P = .176). RYGB (n = 19) patients had greater weight loss than SG patients (n = 14) (26.4 [9.5] versus 13.1 [9.6] kg, P < .001), despite reporting higher daily caloric intake (Î” 669 kcal, P = .059, ES .67) and food weight (Î” 1029 g/d, P = .003, ES 1.11). RYGB patients, compared with SG patients, also ate 1 more fruit per day (P = .023). Pooled data showed no differences between patients with and without T2D remission regarding weight loss, but those in remission drank more nonalcoholic drinks and milk. Five years postoperatively, patients randomized to RYGB reported considerably higher food intake compared with SG despite lower body weight. The reason and importance of the higher food intake after RYGB compared with SG needs to be further studied.",10.1016/j.soard.2022.10.019,,,,280
113,Robotic versus laparoscopic gastric bypass in bariatric surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis on perioperative outcomes.,"Robotic-assisted surgery has emerged as a compelling approach to bariatric surgery. However, current literature has not consistently demonstrated superior outcomes to laparoscopic bariatric surgery to justify its higher cost. With its mechanical advantages, the potential gains from the robotic surgical platform are likely to be apparent in more complex cases such as gastric bypass, especially revisional cases. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize the literature and evaluate the peri-operative outcomes of patients with obesity undergoing robotic gastric bypass versus laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery. Systematic review. A literature search of Embase, Medline, Pubmed, Cochrane library, and Google Scholar was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies comparing outcomes of robotic and laparoscopic gastric bypass for obesity were included. Twenty-eight eligible studies comprised a total of 82,155 patients; 9051 robotic bypass surgery (RBS) versus 73,104 laparoscopic bypass surgery (LBS) were included. All included studies compared Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. RBS was noted to have higher reoperation rate within 30 days (4.4% versus 3.4%; odds ratio 1.31 [95% CI, 1.04-1.66]; P = .027; I2 = 43.5%) than LBS. All other endpoints measured (complication rate, anastomotic leak, anastomotic stricture, surgical site infections, hospital readmission, length of stay, operative time, conversion rate and mortality) did not show any difference between RBS and LBS. This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference in key outcome measures in robotic versus laparoscopic gastric bypass. RBS was associated with a slightly higher reoperation rate and there was no reduction in overall complication rate with the use of robotic platform.",10.1016/j.soard.2023.08.007,,,,281
436,Enhanced recovery programmes versus conventional care in bariatric surgery: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis.,"With obesity prevalence projected to increase, the demand for bariatric surgery will consequently rise. Enhanced recovery programmes aim for improved recovery, earlier discharge, and more efficient use of resources following surgery. This systematic literature review aimed to evaluate the evidence available on the effects of enhanced recovery programmes after three common bariatric procedures: laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), and one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library and the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database were searched for studies published in 2012-2019 comparing outcomes with enhanced recovery programmes versus conventional care after bariatric surgery in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Data were extracted and meta-analyses or descriptive analyses performed when appropriate using R. Of 1152 screened articles, seven relevant studies including 3592 patients were identified. Six reported outcomes for 1434 patients undergoing LRYGB; however, as only individual studies reported on LSG and OAGB these could not be included in the analyses. The meta-analysis revealed a significantly shorter mean duration of hospital-stay for LRYGB enhanced recovery programmes than conventional care (mean difference [95% CI]: -1.34 days [-2.01, -0.67]; p<0.0001), supported by sensitivity analysis excluding retrospective studies. Meta-analysis found no significant difference in 30-day readmission rate (risk ratio [95% CI]: 1.39 [0.84, 2.28]; p = 0.2010). Complication rates were inconsistently reported by Clavien-Dindo grade, but descriptive analysis showed generally higher low-grade rates for enhanced recovery programmes; the trend reversed for high-grade complications. Reoperation rates were rarely reported; no significant differences were seen. These results support enhanced recovery programmes allowing shorter inpatient stay without significant differences in readmission rate following LRYGB, although complication and reoperation rate comparisons were inconclusive. Further research is needed to fill current data gaps including the lack of studies on LSG and OAGB.",10.1371/journal.pone.0243096,,,,282
1098,Bariatric surgery in morbidly obese adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane were systematically reviewed for available evidence on bariatric surgery in adolescents. Thirty-seven included studies evaluated the effect of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in patients â‰¤18 years old. Fifteen of 37 studies were prospective, including one RCT. Mean body mass index (BMI) loss after LAGB was 11.6 kg/m(2) (95% CI 9.8-13.4), versus 16.6 kg/m(2) (95% CI 13.4-19.8) after RYGB and 14.1 kg/m(2) (95% CI 10.8-17.5) after LSG. Two unrelated deaths were reported after 495 RYGB procedures. All three bariatric procedures result in substantial weight loss and improvement of comorbidity with an acceptable complication rate, indicating that surgical intervention is applicable in appropriately selected morbidly obese adolescents.",10.1007/s11695-015-1581-2,,,,283
1587,Prospective evaluation of biliopancreatic diversion with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in the super obese.,"The aim of this study was to determine prospectively the efficacy and safety of the biliopancreatic diversion with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (BPD with RYGBP) procedure used as the primary bariatric procedure in super obese patients. The main characteristics of the BPD with RYGBP procedure were a gastric pouch of 15 +/- 5 ml, biliopancreatic limb of 200 cm, common limb of 100 cm, and alimentary limb of the remainder of the small intestine. From June 1994 through July 2003, 132 super obese patients (body mass index [BMI]: 57 +/- 7), with an incidence of comorbidities 6 +/- 2 per patient, underwent BPD with RYGBP and subsequent follow-up. Mean follow-up time was 29 +/- 14 months. Maximum weight loss was achieved at 18 months postoperative with average excess weight loss (EWL) 65%, average initial weight loss (IWL) 39%, and average BMI 35 kg/m(2). Thereafter, a decline was observed with EWL stabilizing at around 50%, IWL at around 30%, and BMI at around 40 kg/m(2), respectively, by the end of the study period. The majority of preexisting comorbidities were permanently resolved by the 6-month follow-up visit. Early mortality was 1% and early morbidity was 11%. Late morbidity was 27%, half of which was due to incisional hernia. Deficiencies of microelements were mild and successfully treated with additional oral supplementation. The incidence of hypoalbuminemia was 3% and there were no hepatic complications. We conclude that BPD with RYGBP is a safe and effective procedure for the super obese with few metabolic complications.",10.1016/j.gassur.2003.11.022,,,,284
357,Midterm Results from the Dutch Common Channel Trial (DUCATI): Superior Weight Loss Results of the Long Roux Limb Gastric Bypass in Comparison to the Standard Bypass at 3-Year Follow-Up.,"In the multi-center Dutch Common Channel Trial (DUCATI), a very long Roux limb Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (VLRL-RYGB: BP-limb 60Â cm, Roux limb variable, and common channel 100Â cm) was compared to a standard Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (S-LRYGB: BP-limb 60Â cm, Roux limb 150Â cm, and common channel variable) in the treatment of morbidly obese patients. As all trial patients are beyond 3-year follow-up a midterm analysis was performed to investigate the effect of the VLRL-RYGB. A total of 444 patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either a VLRL-RYGB or a S-LRYGB. Follow-up results for weight loss, effect on obesity-related comorbid conditions, complications, reoperation, and malnutrition are investigated. At 3-year follow-up a significant difference in %TWL (34.0% vs. 31.4%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.017) and %EWL (84.7% vs. 76.6%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.043) was observed in favor of VLRL-LRYGB group. Overall complication rate 3-years after surgery was 15.8% in the VLRL-LRYGB group vs. 9% in the S-LRYGB group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.031). Eight (3.6%) patients in the VLRL-LRYGB group versus 2 (0.9%) in the S-LRYGB group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.055) required revisional surgery for malabsorption. In the VLRL-LRYGB group 71.9% of patients had resolution of T2DM versus 48.9% in the S-LRYGB group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.044). At midterm FU a considerable, significantly increased effect on weight loss of the VLRL-LRYGB was observed compared to the S-LRYGB, with a higher risk of overall complications, but no significant nutritional side effects. These results might impact the current view on the value of the Roux limb in the discussion on optimum limb lengths in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.",10.1007/s11695-021-05690-6,,,,285
459,Effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on Barrett's esophagus: a systematic review.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has been recommended as the bariatric procedure of choice for morbidly obese patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE). To systematically review the effect of RYGB on BE. University hospital, Melbourne, Australia. A systematic review was performed. Studies were included of patients who had BE who underwent RYGB and had minimum 1 follow-up gastroscopy postoperatively. English language full-text articles were included, with case reports excluded. Endoscopic assessment methods of BE were compared to the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) clinical guideline recommendations. A novel methodological quality assessment tool to assess risk of bias was developed. For each study, potential confounders for the effect of RYGB on BE were analyzed. Of 28 articles, 5 publications met inclusion criteria. Quality assessment did not demonstrate any high-quality publications. Of 63 patients, no cases showed progression of BE. Overall, regression rates of BE assessed at the postoperative endoscopy varied from 36%-62%. There was a lack of consensus between authors on definition of regression and short- versus long-segment BE. Eighty percent of patients with dysplasia had regression of dysplasia. Both studies that provided all required endoscopic information had poor compliance with ACG recommendations. Potential confounding factors for the effect of RYGB on BE included preoperative risk factors, selection bias based on length of BE, type of RYGB (resectional or nonresectional), concomitant hiatus hernia repair, postoperative use of proton pump inhibitor, and amount of weight loss. RYGB has been shown to be associated with regression of BE and dysplasia in some patients, with no cases of progression after short-term postoperative endoscopic assessment. A clearer definition of regression of BE and following ACG recommendations is necessary to allow standardized reporting and comparison of future results. Long-term, larger, multicenter high-quality studies, including assessment of all potential contributing factors for BE regression, are required.",10.1016/j.soard.2020.09.003,,,,286
1104,"One-year human experience with a novel endoluminal, endoscopic gastric bypass sleeve for morbid obesity.","Here, we report the first series of patients with 1-year implantation of a novel, endoluminal, endoscopically delivered and retrieved gastro-duodeno-jejunal bypass sleeve (GJBS) (ValenTx, Inc. Carpinteria, CA, USA). In this report, we present the safety, feasibility of the device, weight loss, and changes in comorbidities. A prospective, single-center, 12-month trial was designed. The patients are morbidly obese individuals who meet the NIH criteria for bariatric surgery. The GJBS is a 120-cm sleeve secured at the esophago-gastric junction with endoscopic and laparoscopic techniques that is designed to create an endoluminal gastro-duodeno-jejunal bypass. The device was implanted and, at the completion of the trial, retrieved with an endoscopic technique. The primary endpoints were safety and incidence of adverse events. The secondary outcomes included the percentage of excess weight loss (EWL) and changes in comorbidities, specifically glucose control, use of antihyperglycemics, and changes in hemoglobin A1C levels. From July 2009 until October 2009, 13 patients were prospectively enrolled for the 1-year trial. The study included five men and eight women with a mean preoperative BMI of 42Â kg/m(2). One patient was excluded, at the time of endoscopic evaluation, due to inflammation at the GE junction. Two additional patients required early explantation of the device, within the first 4Â weeks, due to patient intolerance. Upon explant of the device, both patients' symptoms improved. In the remaining ten patients, the device was implanted, left in situ for 12Â months, and then retrieved endoscopically. Safe delivery of the cuff at the gastro-esophageal junction was seen in all ten patients whom had device implants, without complication. No esophageal leak was seen immediately post-procedure or during follow-up. The sleeve device was well tolerated within the bowel lumen during the 12-month study, specifically, no bowel erosions, ulceration, or pancreatitis was observed. All ten patients reached the 1-year mark. Of the ten, six had fully attached and functional devices throughout the follow-up, verified by endoscopy. The mean percentage EWL, at 1Â year, in this group was 54Â %. In the remaining four patients, partial cuff detachment was observed at follow-up endoscopy. The percentage EWL was lower in this group. Of the six patients that reached a year with a fully attached device, five were followed at an average of 14-months post-explant (26Â months from the time of device implant). These five maintained an average percentage EWL of 30Â % at the 14-month post-explant follow-up. Co-morbidites measured included diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and use of antihyperglycemics. Each of the measured comorbidities showed improvement during the 12-month trial. The endoluminal, GJBS can be safely placed and retrieved. The short-term data show it is well tolerated with a good safety profile. It achieves excellent weight loss results with over 70Â % of all comorbidities resolved or significantly improved.",10.1007/s00464-015-4081-5,,,,287
545,Effects of standard v. very long Roux limb Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on nutrient status: a 1-year follow-up report from the Dutch Common Channel Trial (DUCATI) Study.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is considered the 'gold standard' for surgical treatment of morbid obesity. It is hypothesised that reducing the length of the common limb positively affects the magnitude and preservation of weight loss but may also impose a risk of malnutrition. The aim of this study was to compare patients' nutrient and vitamin deficiencies in standard RYGB with a very long Roux limb RYGB (VLRL-RYGB). This study was part of the multicentre randomised controlled trial (Dutch Common Channel Trial), including 444 patients undergoing an RYGB or a VLRL-RYGB. Laboratory results, use of multivitamin supplements and reoperations were collected at baseline and 1 year postoperative. Primary outcome measure was nutrient deficiency after 1 year postoperative. Secondary outcome measure was the reoperation rate due to malabsorption. In total, 227 patients underwent RYGB and 196 patients underwent VLRL-RYGB. Most common deficiencies at 1 year postoperative were ferritin (17Â·2-18Â·2 %), Fe (23Â·4-35Â·6 %), K (7Â·4-15Â·2 %), vitamin B12 (9Â·0-9Â·9 %) and vitamin D (22Â·7-34Â·5 %). Patients undergoing VLRL-RYGB had slightly but significantly lower levels of Ca, Fe and vitamin D compared with those undergoing RYGB at 1 year postoperative, but significantly higher levels of folic acid and Na. Reoperation rates due to malabsorption were not significantly different between RYGB (2/227, 0Â·9 %) and VLRL-RYGB (7/196, 3Â·6 %) (P = 0Â·088). We concluded that patients undergoing VLRL-RYGB had significantly lower levels of Ca, Fe and vitamin D compared with those undergoing RYGB at 1 year postoperative, but higher levels of folic acid and Na. Reoperation rates did not differ. Close monitoring on nutrient deficiencies should be performed in patients undergoing VLRL-RYGB.",10.1017/S0007114520000616,,,,288
1445,Improvement in glucose metabolism after bariatric surgery: comparison of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: a prospective randomized trial.,"The exclusion of the proximal small intestine is thought to play a major role in the rapid improvement in the metabolic control of diabetes after gastric bypass. In this randomized, prospective, parallel group study, we sought to evaluate and compare the effects of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) with those of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) on fasting, and meal-stimulated insulin, glucose, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels. Thirteen patients were randomized to LRYGB and 14 patients to LSG. The mostly nondiabetic patients were evaluated before, and 1 week and 3 months after surgery. A standard test meal was given after an overnight fast, and blood samples were collected before and after food intake in both groups for insulin, GLP-1, glucose, PYY, and ghrelin concentrations. This trial was registered in www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00356213) before the first patient was randomized. Body weight and body mass index decreased markedly (P < 0.002) and comparably after either procedure. Excess BMI loss was similar at 3 months (43.3 +/- 12.1% vs. 39.4 +/- 9.4%, P > 0.36). After surgery, patients had markedly increased postprandial plasma insulin and GLP-1 levels, respectively (P < 0.01) after both of these surgical procedures, which favor improved glucose homeostasis. Compared with LSG, LRYGB patients had early and augmented insulin responses as early as 1-week postoperative; potentially mediating improved early glycemic control. After 3 months, no significant difference was observed with respect to insulin and GLP-1 secretion between the 2 procedures. Both procedures markedly improved glucose homeostasis: insulin, GLP-1, and PYY levels increased similarly after either procedure. Our results do not support the idea that the proximal small intestine mediates the improvement in glucose homeostasis.",10.1097/SLA.0b013e3181ae32e3,,,,289
1156,"Assessing the feasibility of a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the role of intraperitoneal ropivacaine in gastric bypass surgery: a protocol.","Postoperative pain control remains a major challenge for surgical procedures, including laparoscopic gastric bypass. Pain management is particularly relevant in obese patients who experience a higher number of cardiovascular and pulmonary events. Effective pain management may reduce their risk of serious postoperative complication, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intraperitoneal local anaesthetic, ropivacaine, to reduce postoperative pain in patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. A randomised controlled trial will be conducted to compare intraperitoneal ropivacaine (intervention) versus normal saline (placebo) in 120 adult patients undergoing bariatric bypass surgery. Ropivacaine will be infused over the oesophageal hiatus and throughout the abdomen. Patients in the control arm will undergo the same treatment with normal saline. The primary end point will be postoperative pain at 1, 2 and 4â€…h postoperatively. Pain measurements will then occur every 4â€…h for 24â€…h and every 8â€…h until discharge. Secondary end points will include opioid use, peak expiratory flow, 6â€…min walk distance and quality of life assessed in the immediate postoperative period. Intention-to-treat analysis will be used and repeated measures will be analysed using mixed modelling approach. Post-hoc pairwise comparison of the treatment groups at different time points will be carried out using multiple comparisons with adjustment to the type 1 error. Results of the study will inform the feasibility of recruitment and inform sample size of a larger definitive randomised trial to evaluate the effectiveness of intraperitoneal ropivacaine. This study has been approved by the Ottawa Health Science Network Research Ethics Board and Health Canada in April 2014. The findings of the study will be disseminated through national and international conferences and peer-reviewed journals. Clinicaltrial.gov NCT02154763.",10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005823,,,,290
399,Trends in Serum Vitamin D Levels within 12 Months after One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB).,"To assess serum vitamin D trend from baseline to 12Â months after one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). In this observational cohort analysis of longitudinal data, we assessed the trend of serum vitamin D, and its associations with anthropometric, and biochemical measurements in 98 patients undergoing OAGB in a bariatric surgery center. All participants were on >800Â IU/day vitamin D supplementation. Vitamin D, lipid profile, creatinine, and albumin levels significantly improved at 12Â months post-surgery. Vitamin D concentrations significantly increased from 26.52â€‰Â±â€‰12.32 to 54.52â€‰Â±â€‰27.90Â ng/mL at 12Â months. The correlations between vitamin D concentrations and weight, body mass index, lipid profile, ferritin, glycemic indices, and albumin were not significant. In addition, the correlations between vitamin D and parathormone, vitamin D receptor, calcium, phosphorus, body composition, and basal metabolic rate (BMR) did not reach the threshold of statistical significance at 12Â months following bariatric surgery. Although there was a significant correlation between body weight and body composition (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and basal metabolic rate (BMR) (râ€‰=â€‰0.762, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) at 12Â months, there were no significant correlations between weight change percent and body composition (Pâ€‰>â€‰0.05), BMR (râ€‰=â€‰-0.101, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.350), and vitamin D (râ€‰=â€‰0.120, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.271) at 12Â months. Our results showed that supplementation of vitamin D with dosage of >800Â IU/day is sufficient for prevention of vitamin D deficiency within 12Â months after OAGB surgery. Note: This data is mandatory.",10.1007/s11695-021-05434-6,,,,291
1374,Short versus long Roux-limb length in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery for the treatment of morbid and super obesity: a systematic review of the literature.,"Because of an important burden of disease, obesity is a major public health challenge in the twenty-first century. Where medico-psychological management has shown its limitations, bariatric surgery is now acknowledged as the most efficient therapy potentially offered to severely obese patients. Among other options, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) is the most frequently performed procedure. The objective of this review is to systematically evaluate the effect of the Roux- (alimentary) limb length on postoperative weight loss after RYGBP in severely obese patients. MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched using terms related to Roux-limb, gastric bypass and obesity. To be included, studies had to be either randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized controlled trials or prospective cohort studies comparing a shorter to a longer Roux-limb. Studies were critically appraised with regard to methodological components. Eight studies were reviewed. Variations in methodology, operation design and outcome assessment among studies caused considerable clinical heterogeneity, preventing us from performing a meta-analysis. The overall quality was questionable, owing to lack of rigor in methodological components reporting. Results were heterogeneous, but we identified a trend supporting that the construction of a longer Roux-limb is more efficient in super obese patients. This review suggests that the tailoring of a longer Roux-limb might only be efficient in super obese patients. The overall limited quality of the included studies prompts to call for improvement in trial design in surgery.",10.1007/s11695-011-0409-y,,,,292
1253,Effect of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery on type 2 diabetes mellitus with hypertension: a randomized controlled trial.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery compared with usual care with and without Exenatide therapy in obese people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension. 108 obese T2DM with hypertension were enrolled and randomly allocated to usual care (group A), usual care plus Exenatide (group B), and RYGB surgery (group C). Demographic characteristics, metabolic parameters and cardiac structure/function along with inflammatory cytokines were measured and compared before and after 12 months. At 12 months, diabetes remission had occurred in no patients in groups A and B versus 90% in group C, and there was a significant decrease in requirement of antihypertensive drugs in group C compared with groups A and B (P<0.05). Other parameters (body mass index, hemoglobin A1c, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, lipids), inflammation index (high sensitivity C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-Î±, high molecular weight adiponectin) and cardiac structure (left ventricular mass index) were significantly improved in groups B and C, but patients in group C had the greatest degree of improvement (P<0.05). RYGB surgery improves a number of parameters including cardiovascular function in obese hypertensive people with T2DM. This is likely to be due to, at least in part, an improvement in the abnormal metabolic panel and to reduced inflammation.",10.1016/j.diabres.2013.04.005,,,,293
1162,Argon plasma coagulation of gastrojejunal anastomosis for weight regain after gastric bypass.,"The failure of approximately 20 % of obese patients who undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) to maintain weight loss over the following 18-24 months is related to the surgical procedure, to the patient, or both. Although the underlying mechanisms are uncertain, one factor that has been postulated is the dilation of the gastrojejunal anastomosis. The objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the serial use of argon plasma coagulation (APC) in reducing the diameter of the dilated gastrojejunal anastomosis and post-RYGB weight regain. We carried out a prospective, nonrandomized study of 30 patients, with no control or sham group, monitoring RYGB weight regain associated with dilation of the gastrojejunal anastomosis over a postoperative period of 18 months. Each patient underwent three sessions of APC in the anastomosis separated by 8 weeks, with a final endoscopic examination 8 weeks after the last session. There was a loss of 15.48 kg (rangeâ€‰=â€‰8.0-16.0 kg) of the 19.6 kg (rangeâ€‰=â€‰7.0-39.0 kg) of regained weight after RYGB and a reduction of 66.89 % in the final anastomotic diameter, with statistically significant reductions between each APC session. Previous body mass index significantly decreased up to the final examination, and the final weight was close to but not at the same level as the nadir. Our study indicates that the use of APC to treat weight regain after RYGB is a safe and effective procedure and promotes a reduction in gastrojejunal anastomosis, final weight, and BMI, with a low rate of complications.",10.1007/s11695-014-1363-2,,,,294
412,Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy with Omentopexy: Is It Really a Promising Method?-A Systematic Review with Meta-analysis.,"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is one of the most commonly performed bariatric procedure worldwide. Omentopexy during LSG is a novel variation of this well-established technique. There are no clear conclusions on indications for this procedure, safeness, and effects of such a method. We aimed to compare the outcomes of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) with omentopexy (OP) and without omentopexy. We searched the Medline, EMBASE, and Scopus databases up-to June 2020. Full-text articles and conference abstracts were included for further analysis. This review follows the PRISMA guidelines. Of initial 66 records, only 4 studies (N = 1396 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Our findings showed that LSG with omentopexy had significantly lowered overall morbidity compared to LSG without omentopexy (RR = 0.38; 95% CI [0.15, 0.94]; p=0.04). Gastric leakage rate (RR = 0.17; 95% CI [0.04, 0.76]; p = 0.02) was also significantly lower in LSG with omentopexy. There were no significant differences between groups in length of hospital stay. Our meta-analysis showed that LSG with omentopexy may be a feasible procedure for decreasing morbidity and gastric leak rate. However, despite promising results, the procedure needs to be researched more in randomized controlled studies to draw solid conclusions.",10.1007/s11695-021-05327-8,,,,295
158,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, gastric banding, or sleeve gastrectomy for severe obesity: Baseline data from the By-Band-Sleeve randomized controlled trial.","This paper reportsÂ the study design, participant characteristics, and recruitment results of By-Band-Sleeve, which investigated the clinical and cost-effectiveness of gastric bypass, gastric banding, and sleeve gastrectomy in adults with severe obesity in the UK. A pragmatic open adaptive noninferiority trial with 3-year follow-up was conducted. Participants were randomly assigned to bypass or band initially and to sleeve after the adaptation. Co-primary end points are weight loss and health-related quality of life assessed using the EQ-5D utility index. Between December 2012 and August 2015, the study recruited into two groups and, after the adaptation, into three groups until September 2019. The study screened 6960 patients; 4732 (68%) were eligible and 1351 (29%) were randomized; 5 subsequently withdrew consent to use data, leaving 462, 464, and 420 assigned to bypass, band, and sleeve, respectively. Baseline data showed high levels of obesity (mean BMIÂ =Â 46.4Â kg/m2; SD: 6.9) and comorbidities (e.g., 31% diabetes), low scores for health-related quality of life, and high levels of anxiety and depression (e.g., 25% abnormal scores). Nutritional parameters were poor, and the average equivalized household income was low (Â£16,667). By-Band-Sleeve fully recruited. Participant characteristics are consistent with contemporary patients having bariatric surgery, and therefore the results will be generalizable.",10.1002/oby.23746,,,,296
699,Impact of implementation of an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) program in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a prospective randomized clinical trial.,"The essence of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) program is the multimodal approach, and many authors have demonstrated safety and feasibility in fast-track bariatric surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the postoperative pain after the implementation of an ERAS protocol in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and to compare it with the application of a standard care protocol. University Hospital Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid, Spain. A prospective randomized clinical trial of all the patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was performed. Patients were randomized into the following 2 groups: those patients after an ERAS program and those patients after a standard care protocol. Postoperative pain, nausea or vomiting, morbidity, mortality, hospital stay, and analytic acute phase reactants 24 hours after surgery were evaluated. One hundred eighty patients were included in the study, 90 in each group. Postoperative pain (16 versus 37 mm; P < .001), nausea or vomiting (8.9% versus 2.2%; Pâ€¯=â€¯.0498), and hospital stay (1.7 versus 2.8 d; P < .001) were significantly lower in the ERAS group. There were no significant differences in complications, mortality, and readmission rates. White blood cell count, serum fibrinogen, and C reactive protein levels were significantly lower in the ERAS group 24 hours after surgery. The implementation of an ERAS protocol was associated with lower postoperative pain, reduced incidence of postoperative nausea or vomiting, lower levels of acute phase reactants, and earlier hospital discharge. Complications, reinterventions, mortality, and readmission rates were similar to that obtained after a standard care protocol.",10.1016/j.soard.2018.11.002,,,,297
80,LAPAROSCOPIC SLEEVE GASTRECTOMY VERSUS LAPAROSCOPIC ROUX-EN-Y GASTRIC BYPASS FOR WEIGHT LOSS IN OBESE PATIENTS: WHICH IS MORE EFFECTIVE? A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS.,"Bariatric surgery is the most effective option to reduce weight in morbid obesity patients. The techniques most employed are the restrictive surgery laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), surgical procedures of intestinal malabsorption, and both types (restrictive and intestinal malabsorption) such as the Roux-en-Y laparoscopic gastric bypass (RYLGB). To determine if LSG is more effective than RYLGB for weight loss. A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out, including five clinical trials and sixteen cohorts comparing LSG versus RYLGB in weight loss and secondary outcomes: resolution of comorbidities, postoperative complications, operative time, hospital stay, and improvement in quality of life. Excess weight loss was 10.2% (mean difference [MD] 10.2; 95%CI -10.14; -9.90) higher in patients undergoing LSG than in patients submitted to RYLGB. Diabetes mellitus type 2 was resolved in 17% (relative risk [RR] 0.83; 95%CI 0.77-0.90) of cases, more significantly after LSG, arterial hypertension in 23% (RR 0.77; 95%CI 0.69-0.84), and dyslipidemia in 17% (RR 0.83; 95%CI 0.77-0.90). Postoperative complications were 73% higher in patients undergoing RYLGB (MD 0.73; 95%CI 0.63-0.83). The operative time was 35.76 minutes shorter in the LSG (MD -35.76; 95%CI -37.28; -34.24). Finally, the quality of life improved more in patients operated by LSG (MD 0.37; 95%CI -0.48; -0.26). The study demonstrated that LSG could be more effective than RYLGB in reducing the percentage of excess weight, comorbidities, postoperative complications, operative time, hospital stay, and in improving quality of life.",10.1590/0102-672020230064e1782,,,,298
1300,Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass vs. laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity and diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of sixteen recent studies.,"Bariatric surgery has become the best option for the treatment for morbid obesity. It is not only a weight-reducing surgery but also a metabolic surgery. This study examined the short-term results undergoing LRYGB and LSG of bariatric surgery. Studies and relevant literatures regarding the formation of LRYGB vs. LSG for morbid obesity or diabetes were searched through PubMed and Embase. The resolution of diabetes mellitus, resolution of hypertension and excess weight loss (EWL) in 12 months by LRYGB or LSG were pooled and compared using a meta-analysis. The odd ratios and mean differences were calculated with 95% confidence intervals to evaluate the influence of LRYGB. Sixteen recent studies including 2758 patients in total were included in this meta-analysis. These studies demonstrated that compared with LSG, LRYGB had the better effect in resolving diabetes mellitus and excess weight loss at 12 months, had a similar effect in resolving hypertension (pooled OR of 2.46 (95% CI: 1.48-4.09, p<0.00001), pooled OR of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.57-1.16, p>0.005), pooled mean difference of 8.27 (95% CI: 6.89-9.66, p<0.00001), respectively). In bariatric surgery, LRYGB is a more effective and reliable treatment for morbid obesity and for surgical treatment of poorly controlled T2DM. More large, prospective, controlled, randomized trials should be conducted to further compare the efficacy and safety of this approach.",10.5754/hge12510,,,,299
1633,Initial results with a stapled gastrojejunostomy for the laparoscopic isolated roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"The gastric pouch to jejunum anastomosis is a critical step in the performance of an isolated Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. When performing this procedure laparoscopically, intracorporeal suturing of the gastric pouch to Roux-en-Y jejunum anastomosis is technically demanding, time consuming, and perhaps the most prohibitive part of the operation. We devised a unique, effective, and simple method to perform this anastomosis using an EEA stapler. This report describes this technique and its follow-up in our series of patients undergoing a laparoscopic isolated Roux-en-Y gastric bypass utilizing this technique. A prospective analysis was performed identifying the technical success, leak rate, and postoperative incidence of anastomotic stenosis and its management in a consecutive series of patients undergoing a laparoscopic isolated Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with a gastrojejunal anastomosis constructed with a 21-mm or 25-mm EEA stapler. Forty-eight patients underwent laparoscopic isolated Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Mean age was 40.9 years (range 22 to 64) and mean body mass index was 52.3 kg/m(2) (range 31 to 76 kg/m(2)). There were no mortalities. Three patients (6.3%) were converted to an open procedure, but only 1 because of an inability to perform the gastrojejunal anastomosis (short jejunal mesentery). There was 1 leak (2.1%) from the gastrojejunal anastomosis. It was successfully managed nonoperatively. Thirteen patients (27.1%) patients developed an anastomotic stenosis requiring endoscopic balloon dilatation. Seven of the 13 patients required only a single dilatation and have had no recurrence of dysphagia. Six of the 13 patients needed 2 to 4 dilatations, and all are swallowing normally. None have required surgical revision. After 12 months of follow-up, the mean weight loss was 115 pounds and mean decrease in body mass index was 18.5 kg/m(2). The stapled EEA gastrojejunal anastomosis for the laparoscopic isolated Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is safe and effective. Anastomotic stenosis occurs in approximately one quarter of patients, but it can be managed well with endoscopic balloon dilatation.",10.1016/s0002-9610(00)00393-7,,,,300
460,Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass vs Sleeve Gastrectomy for Remission of Type 2 Diabetes.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are the bariatric procedures most commonly used for the management of obesity. Whether one or the other is associated with a higher chance of remission of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is unclear. This work aims to compare the efficacy of RYGB and SG for T2D remission at 1, 3, and 5 years after surgery. Four databases were searched until January 2020. Randomized controlled studies with at least 12 months of follow-up of patients with T2D allocated to RYGB or SG were selected. To ensure uniformity, broad and narrow criteria for T2D remission were defined. The number of patients achieving remission of T2D at each assessment was extracted. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. Ten studies were included, evaluating 778 patients. The overall prevalence of achievement of broad and narrow criteria for T2D remission was 73% and 53% at the 1-year, 60% and 48% at the 3-year, and 51% and 43% at the 5-year assessment. Compared to SG, RYGB was associated with a higher chance of achieving broad and narrow criteria for remission at 1 year after surgery (risk ratio [RR]â€…=â€…1.34 vs RRâ€…=â€…1.22) and broad criteria for remission at 5 years (RRâ€…=â€…1.18). No other differences were found. The present meta-analysis suggests a more favorable effect of RYGB than SG on achieving T2D remission in the short-term only, although the evidence currently available does not clarify whether differences in this outcome are confirmed long term or fade thereafter.",10.1210/clinem/dgaa737,,,,301
1543,Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy as an initial weight-loss procedure for high-risk patients with morbid obesity.,"The surgical treatment of obesity in the high-risk, high-body-mass-index (BMI) (>60) patient remains a challenge. Major morbidity and mortality in these patients can approach 38% and 6%, respectively. In an effort to achieve more favorable outcomes, we have employed a two-stage approach to such high-risk patients. This study evaluates our initial outcomes with this technique. In this study, patients underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) as a first stage during the period January 2002-February 2004. After achieving significant weight loss and reduction in co-morbidities, these patients then proceeded with the second stage, laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP). During this time, 126 patients underwent LSG (53% female). The mean age was 49.5 +/- 0.9 years, and the mean BMI was 65.3 +/- 0.8 (range 45-91). Operative risk assessment determined that 42% were American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status score (ASA) III and 52% were ASA IV. The mean number of co-morbid conditions per patient was 9.3 +/- 0.3 with a median of 10 (range 3-17). There was one distant mortality and the incidence of major complications was 13%. Mean excess weight after LSG at 1 year was 46%. Thirty-six patients with a mean BMI of 49.1 +/- 1.3 (excess weight loss, EWL, 38%) had the second-stage LRYGBP. The mean number of co-morbidities in this group was 6.4 +/- 0.1 (reduced from 9). The ASA class of the majority of patients had been downstaged at the time of LRYGB. The mean time interval between the first and second stages was 12.6 +/- 0.8 months. The mean and median hospital stays were 3 +/- 1.7 and 2.5 (range 2-7) days, respectively. There were no deaths, and the incidence of major complications was 8%. The staging concept of LSG followed by LRYGBP is a safe and effective surgical approach for high-risk patients seeking bariatric surgery.",10.1007/s00464-005-0134-5,,,,302
578,Impact of Bariatric Surgery on Long-term Cardiovascular Risk: Comparative Effectiveness of Different Surgical Procedures.,"Several reports highlight bariatric surgery as an efficient and long-lasting strategy for weight loss. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the impact of bariatric surgery on 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and to compare the effectiveness of different surgical procedures, employing the Framingham Risk Score (FRS). Retrospective longitudinal observational study of patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Data was assessed preoperatively and during a 4-year follow-up period. We evaluated 1449 individuals, 85.2% female, age of 42.4 Â± 10.6 years, and preoperative BMI of 44.3 Â± 5.8 kg/m2; 58.0% underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), 23.4% sleeve gastrectomy (SG), and 18.6% adjustable gastric band (AGB). The 10-year CVD risk decreased 43.6% in the first postoperative year. The decrease in FRS was more pronounced in the RYGB group (50.5% in the first postoperative year) (p < 0.001). Although there was a subsequent slight increase in FRS during the follow-up period, the cardiovascular benefits were maintained when compared with baseline. For all surgical procedures, CVD risk showed a quadratic trend with a J-shaped curve. A negative interaction between the RYGB group CVD risk and time was observed (Î² = - 0.072 (95% CI, - 0.109; - 0.035)). In the RYGB group, FRS decreased more when compared with the SG and AGB groups and, from the second postoperative year onwards, increased more slowly, regardless of gender. The SG group showed similar trend as that of the AGB (Î² = - 0.002 (95% CI, - 0.049; 0.053)). Our study showed a significant reduction of 10-year CVD risk after bariatric surgery. This decrease was more pronounced in the first postoperative year, and RYGB was the procedure with the greatest decrease of the 10-year CVD risk.",10.1007/s11695-019-04237-0,,,,303
22,Gastric Bypass vs Diet and Cardiovascular Risk Factors: A Nonrandomized Controlled Trial.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is associated with reduced cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, morbidity, and mortality. Whether these effects are specifically induced by the surgical procedure or the weight loss is unclear. To compare 6-week changes in CV risk factors in patients with obesity undergoing matching caloric restriction and weight loss by RYGB or a very low-energy diet (VLED). This nonrandomized controlled study (Impact of Body Weight, Low Calorie Diet, and Gastric Bypass on Drug Bioavailability, Cardiovascular Risk Factors, and Metabolic Biomarkers [COCKTAIL]) was conducted at a tertiary care obesity center in Norway. Participants were individuals with severe obesity preparing for RYGB or a VLED. Recruitment began February 26, 2015; the first patient visit was on March 18, 2015, and the last patient visit (9-week follow-up) was on August 9, 2017. Data were analyzed from April 30, 2021, through June 29, 2023. VLED alone for 6 weeks or VLED for 6 weeks after RYGB; both interventions were preceded by 3-week LED. Between-group comparisons of 6-week changes in CV risk factors. Among 78 patients included in the analyses, the mean (SD) age was 47.5 (9.7) years; 51 (65%) were women, and 27 (35%) were men. Except for a slightly higher mean (SD) body mass index of 44.5 (6.2) in the RYGB group (nâ€‰=â€‰41) vs 41.9 (5.4) in the VLED group (n = 37), baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between groups. Major atherogenic blood lipids (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein[a]) were reduced after RYGB in comparison with VLED despite a similar fat mass loss. Mean between-group differences were -17.7 mg/dL (95% CI, -27.9 to -7.5), -17.4 mg/dL (95% CI, -29.8 to -5.0) mg/dL, -9.94 mg/dL (95% CI, -15.75 to -4.14), and geometric mean ratio was 0.55 U/L (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.72), respectively. Changes in glycemic control and blood pressure were similar between groups. This study found that clinically meaningful reductions in major atherogenic blood lipids were demonstrated after RYGB, indicating that RYGB may reduce CV risk independent of weight loss.

829,Laparoscopic Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass Improves Lipid Profile and Decreases Cardiovascular Risk: a 5-Year Longitudinal Cohort Study of 1048 Patients.,"Dyslipidemia is a known risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) events. The aim of the study was to assess lipid profiles and their impact on CV risk changes in a large patient cohort 5Â years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). All patients who underwent primary RYGB for severe obesity in our two hospitals between January 1999 and December 2009 were included. The Framingham risk score was used. One thousand and forty-eight patients were included, 791 women and 257 men. Five-year complete lipid profile was available for 77% of patients. At 5Â years, mean body mass index (BMI) decreased from 45.7Â Â±Â 6 to 31Â Â±Â 5.8Â kg/m2 (pÂ <Â 0.001), excess BMI loss (EBMIL) was 72.35Â Â±Â 22%, and total body weight loss (TWL) 31.5Â Â±Â 9%. Lipid values improved significantly. Total- and LDL-cholesterol levels dropped at 1Â year from 5.4 to 4.48Â mmol/L and 3.2 to 2.41Â mmol/L, respectively, and slightly increased thereafter. Triglyceride levels dropped from 2 to 1.17Â mmol/L at 1Â year and remained unchanged. HDL levels rose continuously from 1.27 to 1.77Â mmol/L at 5Â years. Lipid profile improved more in patients with greater weight loss (%EBMIL â‰¥Â 50 or %TWL â‰¥Â 25%). Assuming that all patients were non-smokers and other baseline risk factors (hypertension, diabetes) remained unchanged at 5Â years, the amelioration of the lipid profile itself yielded to a 27% reduction of CV risk (pÂ <Â 0.001). RYGB results in sustained excess weight loss and in amelioration of the lipid profile from the first to fifth postoperative year. This improvement translates into significantly lower CV risk from the first year after surgery.",10.1007/s11695-017-2938-5,,,,305
234,Magnetic device in reduced port and single port bariatric surgery: First 170 cases experience.,"Magnetic devices have been successfully used in bariatric surgery. To the date, the only reported use of the magnet was for liver retraction. Our purpose in this study is to demonstrate the safety and viability of using a magnetic system in different steps in single port and reduced port bariatric surgery. Prospective and observational study was performed. Patients older than 18 years, undergoing primary laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG), one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB), and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or revisional surgery by single-port or reduced-port approach between July 2020 and June 2021 were included. A total of 170 patients (mean BMI, 41.47kg/m2; mean age 36.92 yrs) completed laparoscopic bariatric surgery (54 single-port sleeve gastrectomy [SPSG], 16 reduced-port SG, 83 RYGB, 4 OAGB and 14 revision surgeries), using the magnetic surgical system in different steps of the surgery. Mean surgical time for SPSG and reduced-port SG was 65.52min and 59.36min respectively; and for RYGB 74.19min, OAGB 70.98min, and revisional surgeries 88.38min. As for intraoperative complications, 2.94% mild liver laceration without significant bleeding was reported. There were no 30-day mortalities and no major complications. Magnetic assistance in single-port and reduced-port bariatric surgery is an innovative technique. With this prospective study we attempt to demonstrate the safety profile and potential uses that may improve the implementation of new surgical approaches in bariatric surgery.",10.1016/j.cireng.2022.08.016,,,,306
903,Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy Versus Roux-Y-Gastric Bypass for Morbid Obesity-3-Year Outcomes of the Prospective Randomized Swiss Multicenter Bypass Or Sleeve Study (SM-BOSS).,"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is performed almost as often in Europe as laparoscopic Roux-Y-Gastric Bypass (LRYGB). We present the 3-year interim results of the 5-year prospective, randomized trial comparing the 2 procedures (Swiss Multicentre Bypass Or Sleeve Study; SM-BOSS). Initially, 217 patients (LSG, n = 107; LRYGB, n = 110) were randomized to receive either LSG or LRYGB at 4 bariatric centers in Switzerland. Mean body mass index of all patients was 44â€ŠÂ±â€Š11â€Škg/m, mean age was 43â€ŠÂ±â€Š5.3 years, and 72% of patients were female. Minimal follow-up was 3 years with a rate of 97%. Both groups were compared for weight loss, comorbidities, quality of life, and complications. Excessive body mass index loss was similar between LSG and LRYGB at each time point (1 year: 72.3â€ŠÂ±â€Š21.9% vs. 76.6â€ŠÂ±â€Š20.9%, P = 0.139; 2 years: 74.7â€ŠÂ±â€Š29.8% vs. 77.7â€ŠÂ±â€Š30%, P = 0.513; 3 years: 70.9â€ŠÂ±â€Š23.8% vs. 73.8â€ŠÂ±â€Š23.3%, P = 0.316). At this interim 3-year time point, comorbidities were significantly reduced and comparable after both procedures except for gastro-esophageal reflux disease and dyslipidemia, which were more successfully treated by LRYGB. Quality of life increased significantly in both groups after 1, 2, and 3 years postsurgery. There was no statistically significant difference in number of complications treated by reoperation (LSG, n = 9; LRYGB, n = 16, P = 0.15) or number of complications treated conservatively. In this trial, LSG and LRYGB are equally efficient regarding weight loss, quality of life, and complications up to 3 years postsurgery. Improvement of comorbidities is similar except for gastro-esophageal reflux disease and dyslipidemia that appear to be more successfully treated by LRYGB.",10.1097/SLA.0000000000001929,,,,307
251,Medication following bariatric surgery for type 2 diabetes mellitus (BY-PLUS) study: rationale and design of a randomised controlled study.,"Bariatric surgery is an effective method of controlling glycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. Long-term studies suggest that although glycaemic control remains good, only 20%-40% of patients will maintain remission according to the American Diabetes Association criteria. This trial aims to examine the safety and efficacy of combining Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy with goal-directed medical therapy to improve long-term glycaemic control of T2DM. This prospective, open-label multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) will recruit 150 patients with obesity and T2DM from tertiary care obesity centres. Patients will be randomised 1:1 to receive either bariatric surgery and standard medical care or bariatric surgery and intensive goal-directed medical therapy, titrated to specific targets for glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure (BP) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol. The primary endpoints are the proportion of patients in each arm with an HbA1c<6.5% (48 mmol/mol) at 1â€‰year and the proportion of patients in each arm achieving the composite endpoint of HbA1c<6.5% (48 mmol/mol), BP<130/80 mm Hg and LDL<2.6â€‰mmol/L at 5â€‰years. The local institutional review board approved this study. This study represents the first RCT to examine the safety and efficacy of combining bariatric surgery with intensive medical therapy compared with bariatric surgery and usual care for long-term diabetes control.

929,Roux-en-Y gastric bypass reversal: a systematic review.,"Due to the large number of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgeries performed over the last decade, reversal of the bypass to normal anatomy has been increasingly reported. University affiliated Teaching Hospital, United States. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the literature data regarding the indications, technical considerations, and outcomes of gastric bypass reversal. PubMed/MEDLINE search was conducted for articles reporting reversal of gastric bypass to normal anatomy. Patients' demographic characteristics, primary reason for reversal, reversal technique, and postreversal events were retrieved and categorized from each eligible paper. Thirty-five articles encompassing a total of 100 patients were eligible. Malnutrition was the most common indication for reversal (12.3%), followed by severe dumping syndrome (9.4%), postprandial hypoglycemia (8.5%), and excessive weight loss (8.5%). Techniques for gastrogastrostomy were available in 42 patients, with the hand-sewn technique as the most common (67.4%) followed by the linear stapler (23.2%) and the end-to-end anastomosis stapler used in 3 patients (6.9%). The reversal technique was performed endoscopically and described in 3 studies (3 patients). Techniques for handling the Roux limb were described in 56 patients (56%); the limb was reconnected in 32 patients (57.2%) and resected in 24 patients (42.8%). Weight regain was the most prevalent postreversal event (28.8%), followed by severe gastroesophageal reflux diseases (10.2%) and persistent abdominal pain (6.8%). There was no reported mortality. Gastric bypass reversal is indicated for excessive weight loss, dumping syndrome, and postprandial hypoglycemia. The procedure is well tolerated and feasible when performed laparoscopically and has no reported mortality.",10.1016/j.soard.2016.02.023,,,,309
416,Incidence and treatment of intussusception following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Intussusception is a rare yet potentially life-threatening complication following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Multiple case reports have described this complication, and recently, several retrospective studies have been published describing the surgical treatment of intussusception. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of intussusception following RYGB and provide insight into outcomes of subsequent operative treatment. A systematic search was performed using the PubMed and Cochrane databases. Article selection was performed using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses criteria, and selecting articles describing the incidence of intussusception following RYGB. Data was pooled only when 3 or more comparable studies reported on the same outcome. The incidence of intussusception and outcomes of subsequent treatment were analyzed. Furthermore, all published case reports describing intussusception following RYGB were analyzed. A total of 74 studies published between 1991 and 2020 were included, describing 191 patients who underwent RYGB and developed intussusception. We retrieved 68 case reports, including 84 patients, and 6 retrospective studies describing outcomes of surgical treatment in 107 patients, which were used to pool data. There was a predominance of females among the included patients (85%-98%), and patients had significant weight loss following RYGB. The pooled incidence of intussusception following RYGB was .64%. Resection of the affected segment was performed in 34% of the patients. A pooled recurrence rate of 22% was found during follow-up. Resection and reconstruction of the jejunojejunostomy appears to be associated with the lowest risk of recurrence and acceptable complication rates. The pooled incidence of intussusception following RYGB is 0.64%. Typically, patients are female with significant weight loss after RYGB. Symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings and computed tomography scans, warranting early surgical exploration due to the high risk for ischemia. Resection of the jejunojejunostomy appears to be associated with the lowest recurrence rates and acceptable complication rates.",10.1016/j.soard.2021.01.006,,,,310

In this 3-arm randomized clinical trial conducted at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center from October 1, 2009, to June 26, 2014, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, outcomes were assessed 3 years after treating 61 obese participants aged 25 to 55 years with T2DM. Analysis was conducted with an intent-to-treat population. Participants were randomized to either an intensive lifestyle weight loss intervention for 1 year followed by a low-level lifestyle intervention for 2 years or surgical treatments (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [RYGB] or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding [LAGB]) followed by low-level lifestyle intervention in years 2 and 3. Primary end points were partial and complete T2DM remission and secondary end points included diabetes medications and weight change. Body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was less than 35 for 26 participants (43%), 50 (82%) were women, and 13 (21%) were African American. Mean (SD) values were 100.5 (13.7) kg for weight, 47.3 (6.6) years for age, 7.8% (1.9%) for hemoglobin A1c level, and 171.3 (72.5) mg/dL for fasting plasma glucose level. Partial or complete T2DM remission was achieved by 40% (nâ€‰=â€‰8) of RYGB, 29% (nâ€‰=â€‰6) of LAGB, and no intensive lifestyle weight loss intervention participants (Pâ€‰=â€‰.004). The use of diabetes medications was reduced more in the surgical groups than the lifestyle intervention-alone group, with 65% of RYGB, 33% of LAGB, and none of the intensive lifestyle weight loss intervention participants going from using insulin or oral medication at baseline to no medication at year 3 (Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). Mean (SE) reductions in percentage of body weight at 3 years were the greatest after RYGB at 25.0% (2.0%), followed by LAGB at 15.0% (2.0%) and lifestyle treatment at 5.7% (2.4%) (Pâ€‰<â€‰.01). Among obese participants with T2DM, bariatric surgery with 2 years of an adjunctive low-level lifestyle intervention resulted in more disease remission than did lifestyle intervention alone. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01047735.",10.1001/jamasurg.2015.1534,,,,311
669,Laparoscopic Gastroileal Bypass with Single Anastomosis: Analysis of the First 1512 Patients.,"Biliopancreatic diversion is perceived as the most effective operation for long-term treatment of massive obesity. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that gastroileal bypass with single anastomosis is a safe and feasible procedure with similar results to the classic derivation, but reducing surgical time without decreasing the efficacy. Descriptive, observational, prospective study of patients undergoing gastroileal bypass with single anastomosis between April 2010 and December 2015. The postoperative follow-up was 24Â months. One thousand five hundred twelve patients underwent gastroileal bypass. The mean time of the procedure was 32Â min; the average stay was 2.2Â days. 30.1% of patients lost more than 100% of their excess weight, and 72.35% of patients lost more than 75% of their excess weight. 95.17% of patients dropped to a BMI <â€‰35; 75.99% to a BMI <â€‰30 and 30.15% to a BMI <â€‰25. Gastroileal bypass with single anastomosis is a safe and fast procedure providing similar results to biliopancreatic diversion with respect to weight loss.",10.1007/s11695-019-03788-6,,,,312
570,"A Comprehensive Comparison of LRYGB and LSG in Obese Patients Including the Effects on QoL, Comorbidities, Weight Loss, and Complications: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","To systematically and comprehensively evaluate the differences between laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) versus sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in obese patients. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from inception to December 2018. The meta-analysis was performed by the RevMan 5.3 software. Twenty-three articles with 7443 patients were included. In short term (<â€‰3Â years), LRYGB was superior to LSG in terms of improving comorbidities (T2D, odds ratio (OR) 1.93, 1.06-3.52, PÂ <â€‰0.05, hypertension, OR 1.59, 1.08-2.34, PÂ <â€‰0.05, dyslipidemia, OR 1.61, 1.05-2.46, PÂ <â€‰0.05), but there were no differences in the midterm and long term. Quality of life (QoL) after bariatric surgery was included, but no differences were observed in the QoL after LRYGB or LSG (gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI) and Moorehead-Ardelt quality of life questionnaire (M-A-Q), PÂ >â€‰0.05). LRYGB achieved a higher EWL% than LSG (after 3Â years, WMD 5.48, 0.13-10.84.

The rate of early and late complications was much higher in LRYGB than in LSG (early complications, ORâ€‰=â€‰2.11, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.53-2.91, PÂ <â€‰0.001; late complications, ORâ€‰=â€‰2.60, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.93-3.49, PÂ <â€‰0.001). This meta-analysis showed that LRYGB was more effective than LSG in comorbidities' resolution or improvement in short term. For weight loss, LRYGB had better long-term effects than LSG. In addition, no differences were observed in the quality of life after LRYGB or LSG. LRYGB was associated with more complications than LSG.",10.1007/s11695-019-04306-4,,,,313
271,"Aspirin Use as a Risk Factor for Marginal Ulceration in Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Patients: A Meta-Analysis of 24,770 Patients.","Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is a recognized, safe bariatric procedure with minimal complications. Marginal ulceration, however, remains a challenging problem with an incidence of 8-12%. While chronic NSAID use is an established risk factor for ulcer formation, aspirin use itself as a cause for marginal ulceration is still unclear. We aim to compare the rates of marginal ulceration in RYGB with and without aspirin use. PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for articles between 2008 and 2021 by two independent reviewers using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA). The risk of bias was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analysis was conducted using a fixed-effect model. From 5324 studies screened, we included 3 studies. Two studies had a low risk of bias, and the other one presented a high risk of bias on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We included 24,770 patients, 1911 with aspirin use and 22,859 without aspirin use. After the meta-analysis, patients who used aspirin had a significantly higher marginal ulceration rate than those who did not (OR = 1.33 [95% CI 1.08 to 1.63], P < .002; I2 = 39%). Aspirin use is associated with increased rates of marginal ulceration after RYGB.",10.1177/00031348221103647,,,,314
1446,Pilot study evaluating technical feasibility and early outcomes of second-generation endosurgical platform for treatment of weight regain after gastric bypass surgery.,"For some gastric bypass patients, dilation of the gastrojejunal anastomosis (GJA) and/or gastric pouch is believed to contribute to weight regain. The present study had 2 objectives: (1) to assess the technical feasibility and safety of a novel endoscopic procedure called ""revision obesity surgery endoscopic"" (ROSE) using a second-generation, prototype endoscopic operating system that creates tissue plications to reduce the diameter of the GJA and the size of the gastric pouch; and (2) to assess the early outcomes regarding weight loss at a university hospital in the United States. This was a prospective study of 5 patients who had regained a mean of 14.7 kg after gastric bypass with a dilated pouch and GJA on screening endoscopy. The gastric pouch and the GJA were measured before and after the procedure. The patients were followed up for a minimum of 3 months after the procedure. Weight changes were recorded. Technical success was achieved in all 5 patients (100%). The mean weight loss in the successful cases was 7.8 kg at 3 months. No major complications developed. The results of our study have shown that the ROSE procedure using this second-generation prototype endoscopic operating system is technically feasible and appears safe. Our preliminary results suggest that the ROSE procedure is effective in reducing the size of both the GJA and the gastric pouch and could therefore be an alternative therapy for weight regain in postgastric bypass patients.",10.1016/j.soard.2009.03.217,,,,315
569,Risk of Operative and Nonoperative Interventions Up to 4 Years After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass vs Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy in a Nationwide US Commercial Insurance Claims Database.,"There are few nationwide studies comparing the risk of reintervention after contemporary bariatric procedures. To compare the risk of intervention after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) vs vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG). This cohort study used a nationwide US commercial insurance claims database. Adults aged 18 to 64 years who underwent a first RYGB or VSG procedure between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2017, were matched on US region, year of surgery, most recent presurgery body mass index (BMI) category (based on diagnosis codes), and baseline type 2 diabetes. The prematch pool included 4496 patients undergoing RYGB and 8627 patients undergoing VSG, and the final weighted matched sample included 4476 patients undergoing RYGB and 8551 patients undergoing VSG. Bariatric surgery procedure type (RYGB vs VSG). The primary outcome was any abdominal operative intervention after the index procedure. Secondary outcomes included the following subtypes of operative intervention: biliary procedures, abdominal wall hernia repair, bariatric conversion or revision, and other abdominal operations. Nonoperative outcomes included endoscopy and enteral access. Time to first event was compared using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. Among 13â€¯027 patients, the mean (SD) age was 44.4 (10.3) years, and 74.1% were female; 13.7% had a preoperative BMI between 30 and 39.9, 45.8% had a preoperative BMI between 40 and 49.9, and 24.2% had a preoperative BMI of at least 50. Patients were followed up for up to 4 years after surgery (median, 1.6 years; interquartile range, 0.7-3.2 years), with 41.9% having at least 2 years of follow-up and 16.3% having at least 4 years of follow-up. Patients undergoing VSG were less likely to have any subsequent operative intervention than matched patients undergoing RYGB (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72-0.89) and similarly were less likely to undergo biliary procedures (aHR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67-0.90), abdominal wall hernia repair (aHR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47-0.75), other abdominal operations (aHR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.61-0.82), and endoscopy (aHR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.49-0.59) or have enteral access placed (aHR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39-0.86). Patients undergoing VSG were more likely to undergo bariatric conversion or revision (aHR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.19-2.80). In this nationwide study, patients undergoing VSG appeared to be less likely than matched patients undergoing RYGB to experience subsequent abdominal operative interventions, except for bariatric conversion or revision procedures. Patients considering bariatric surgery should be aware of the increased risk of subsequent procedures associated with RYGB vs VSG as part of shared decision-making around procedure choice.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.17603,,,,316

832,Gastric pouch emptying of solid food in patients with successful and unsuccessful weight loss after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.,"After Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), approximately 10% of patients have insufficient weight loss (excess body mass index loss<50%). Gastric pouch emptying may have a role in weight loss. To compare pouch emptying of patients with poor weight loss and patients with successful weight loss after RYGB. A research-intensive nonacademic hospital and center of expertise in bariatric surgery in the Netherlands METHODS: Female patients were included from among patients with the least (poor weight loss group [P-WL]) and the most weight loss (successful weight loss group [S-WL]) in our center 2 years after RYGB. Pouch emptying scintigraphy was performed after ingestion of a radiolabeled solid meal. Emptying curves, intestinal content (IC) at meal completion and after 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, half emptying time, and maximal pouch emptying rate were compared. Five individuals were included in P-WL and 5 in S-WL, on average 2.5 Â± .3 years after RYGB. Total weight loss was 18 Â± 4.1% in P-WL and 44 Â± 5.7% in S-WL (P<.001). In P-WL, a fast initial pouch emptying and exponential emptying curve was observed, compared with a slower initial emptying and more linear curve in S-WL. Faster emptying in P-WL was also shown by a larger ICmeal (42 Â± 18% versus 4.0 Â± 3.3%,), IC15 (76 Â± 15% versus 35 Â± 22%), and IC30 (85 Â± 12% versus 54 Â± 25%), and a greater maximal pouch emptying rate (17 Â± 4.7 versus 5.6 Â± 3.4%/min) compared with S-WL (P<.05). A linear correlation was found between total weight loss and maximal pouch emptying rate (Pearson R = .82, P = .004). Pouch emptying for solid food was faster in patients with the least weight loss compared with patients with the most weight loss after RYGB. If pouch emptying is an important mechanism in weight loss, altering the pouch outlet may improve poor weight loss management.",10.1016/j.soard.2017.07.031,,,,318

The aim of this study was to compare the effect of a BPL of 70 vs 120Â cm, with a constant AL of 150Â cm on long-term weight loss, remission of comorbidities, and supplementation needs after RYGB. A prospective randomized study of morbidly obese patients undergoing RYGB was performed. Patients were randomized into two groups: those patients undergoing RYGB with a BPL of 70Â cm (BPL 70Â cm) and those ones undergoing RYGB with a BPL of 120Â cm (BPL 120Â cm). BMI, excess BMI loss (EBMIL), remission of comorbidities and specific vitamin and mineral supplementation needs at 1, 2, and 5Â years were analyzed.

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of SG and RYGB on ghrelin, leptin, and glucose homeostasis in a randomized controlled trial. University hospital, Poland. Seventy-two morbidly obese patients were randomly selected to undergo either SG (n = 36) or RYGB (n = 36). Fasting ghrelin, leptin, glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, glycated hemoglobin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance were assessed preoperatively and at 1, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. No differences were found in anthropometric and biochemical parameters between the study groups at baseline. Sixty-nine (95.8%) patients completed the study. Percentage of excess weight loss at 12 months was 67.6Â±19.3% after SG and 64.2Â±18.5% after RYGB (P>.05). Fasting ghrelin levels decreased 1 month after SG (from 76.8 pmol/L to 35.3 pmol/L; P<.05) and remained reduced until 12 months (41.6 pmol/L; P<.05) but increased 12 months after RYGB from 74.6 pmol/L to 130.2 pmol/L (P<.05). Leptin, glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations and glycated hemoglobin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance values decreased significantly in both groups during 12 months. RYGB and SG induce comparable weight loss and improvement in metabolism of glucose. Ghrelin levels decrease after SG and increase after RYGB, but this difference does not affect similar outcomes of these procedures during 1-year follow-up. The contribution of ghrelin to weight loss or metabolic benefits after bariatric surgery is not straightforward, but rather influenced by multiple factors.",10.1016/j.soard.2016.08.025,,,,321
1571,Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in patients with BMI <50: a prospective randomized trial comparing short and long limb lengths.,"It has been shown that long limb gastric bypass in the super-obese (BMI >50) results in increased weight loss in comparison with conventional gastric bypass. The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of short and long limb lengths in patients with BMI<50. 48 patients with BMI <50 (46 females / 2 males, mean age 35+/-9.6 years) were prospectively randomized to either a short limb (biliopancreatic limb = 50 cm, alimentary limb = 100 cm) or long limb (biliopancreatic limb = 100 cm, alimentary limb = 150 cm) laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP). In all patients, a 25-mm EEA was used to fashion the gastrojejunostomy and the Roux limb was positioned in an antecolic, antegastric location. Limb lengths were precisely measured in all cases. There was no difference in demographic data, preoperative BMI, presence of co-morbidities, or duration of surgery. The overall complication rate was not different between the 2 groups; however, the incidence of internal hernias was significantly higher in the long limb group (0 vs 4, P=0.029). The length of hospital stay was longer for the short limb group compared to the long limb group (3.1 vs 2.2 respectively, P=0.004). When comparing the short limb to the long limb patients, the BMI decreased equally in both groups at the following time intervals: preoperative (44.6 vs 44.9), 3 weeks (40.3 vs 40.9), 3 months (35.5 vs 35.2), 6 months (31.2 vs 31.8), and 12 months (27.7 vs 28.3). There were no significant nutritional deficiencies in either group. In patients with BMI <50 undergoing LRYGBP, increasing the length of the Roux limb does not improve weight loss and may lead to a higher incidence of internal hernias.",10.1381/0960892052993468,,,,322
313,Seventy years of bariatric surgery: A systematic mapping review of randomized controlled trials.,"While research publications on bariatric surgery (BS) have grown significantly over the past decade, there is no mapping of the existing body of evidence on this field of research. We performed a systematic review followed by a mapping of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in BS for people with obesity. From January 2020 to December 2020, we performed a systematic review of RCTs evaluating BS, versus another surgical procedure, or versus a medical control group, through a search of Embase and PubMed. There was no restriction on outcomes for study selection. A total of 114 RCTs were included, most (73.7%) of which were based on a comparison with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and conducted between 2010 and 2020. Only 15% of the trials were multicenter and few (3.5%) were international. The median number of patients enrolled was 61 (interquartile range [IQR]: 47.3-100). Follow-up time was 1 to 2â€‰years in 36% and 22.8% of the trials, respectively. Weight loss was the most studied criterion (87% of RCTs), followed by obesity-related diseases, and medical and surgical complications (73%, 54%, and 47% of RCTs, respectively). Nutritional deficiency frequency, body composition, and mental health were little studied (20%, 18% and 5% of RCTs, respectively). Our literature review revealed that much research in BS is wasted because of replication of RCTs on subjects for which there is already body of evidence, with small populations and follow-up times mostly below 2â€‰years. Yet several research questions remain unaddressed, and there are few long-term trials.

1145,The impact of psychological support on weight loss post weight loss surgery: a randomised control trial.,"The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the impact of a health psychology-led bariatric rehabilitation service (BRS) on patient weight loss following bariatric surgery at 1 year. A single-site open-randomised parallel group control trial based at St. Richard's Hospital in Chichester in the UK. Patients (nâ€‰=â€‰162) were recruited immediately prior to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and randomly allocated to receive either treatment as usual (nâ€‰=â€‰80) or the BRS (nâ€‰=â€‰82). The BRS involved three 50-min one-to-one sessions with a health psychologist and provided information, support and mentoring pre and post surgery addressing psychological issues such as dietary control, self esteem, coping and emotional eating. Weight loss was assessed at 1 year. The key outcome variable was BMI and change in BMI. Follow-up weight was available for 145 patients. Intention-to-treat analysis (nâ€‰=â€‰162) using last measured weights showed that mean change in BMI by 1 year post surgery was -16.49. There was no significant difference between the two groups (control groupâ€‰=â€‰-16.37, 95 % CIâ€‰=â€‰15.15-17.57; interventionâ€‰=â€‰-16.6, 95 % CIâ€‰=â€‰15.42-17.81; Î· p (2)â€‰=â€‰0.001).

705,Randomized trial of two types of gastrojejunostomy after pancreatoduodenectomy and risk of delayed gastric emptying (PAUDA trial).,"Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) is the most important cause of an extended hospital stay after pancreatoduodenectomy. Reports suggest that a Roux-en-Y gastroenteric anastomosis may have lower incidence of DGE than a Billroth II reconstruction. The primary aim of this RCT was to compare Billroth II (single loop) and Roux-en-Y (double loop) after pancreatoduodenectomy to determine whether Roux-en-Y reconstruction is associated with a lower incidence of DGE. Secondary endpoints were postoperative complications. This was a randomized unblinded single-centre trial without masked evaluation of the main outcome. Patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy between 2013 and 2015 were randomized to undergo one of two types of gastroenteric anastomosis for reconstruction. A total of 80 patients were randomized, 40 in each group. The incidence of DGE was the same in patients undergoing Billroth II or Roux-en-Y gastroenteric anastomosis (both 18 of 40 patients; Pâ€‰=â€‰1Â·000). The grade of DGE was also similar in the Billroth II and Roux-en-Y groups (grade A, both 10 of 40; grade B, 5 of 40 versus 6 of 40; grade C, 3 of 40 versus 2 of 40; Pâ€‰=â€‰0Â·962). The mortality rate was 3 per cent, with no significant difference between the two groups. There were no differences in the overall rate of postoperative morbidity, relaparotomy rate or duration of hospital stay.

1107,Lipid profile changes in patients undergoing bariatric surgery: a comparative study between sleeve gastrectomy and mini-gastric bypass.,"To prospectively evaluate the effect of different types of bariatric surgery on lipid profile. Total cholesterol (TC), High-Density-Lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc), Low-Density-Lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) and triglycerides (TG) levels were evaluated before surgery and at 3 different post-operative time-points (3, 6 and 12 months) in consecutive obese subjects undergoing mini-gastric bypass (MGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG). At baseline, 74 MGB and 86 SG subjects were comparable for lipid profile and prevalence of hypercholesterolemia/hypertriglyceridemia. During the post-operative follow-up, both MGB and SG subjects showed significant changes in lipid profile. However, at 3 months, MGB patients showed higher changes in TC (Î²Â =Â 0.179, pÂ =Â 0.022) and TG (Î²Â =Â 0.265, pÂ =Â 0.001) than those undergoing SG. At 6-month post-operative follow-up, these differences were confirmed only for TC. After a 12-month follow-up, MGB and SG were entirely comparable for changes in lipid profile with the exception of HDLc, whose changes were higher in SG group (Î²Â =Â 0.130, pÂ =Â 0.039). Overall, the probability to normalize lipid profile during the 12-month follow-up was similar in MGB and in SG patients (OR:1.24, 95%CI:0.41-3.76, pÂ =Â 0.689). Despites some differences at 3-6 post-operative months, during a 12-month follow-up, SG and MGB showed a similar efficacy in the improvement of lipid profile of obese patients.",10.1016/j.ijsu.2014.12.025,,,,326
78,Improvement of Triglyceride-Glucose Index Following Bariatric Surgery: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Bariatric surgery is an effective intervention for the management of severe obesity and its associated comorbidities, including metabolic abnormalities. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of bariatric surgery on the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, a novel marker of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. A systematic search was conducted in Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. The meta-analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) V4 software. The overall effect size was determined by a random-effects meta-analysis and the leave-one-out approach. A total of 9 trials including 1620 individuals confirmed a significant reduction in TyG following bariatric surgery (weighted mean difference (WMD)â€‰-â€‰0.770, 95% CIâ€‰-â€‰1.006,â€‰-â€‰0.534, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). In a sub-analysis according to the type of bariatric surgery there was a significant reduction in TyG index for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (WMDâ€‰-â€‰0.775, 95% CIâ€‰-â€‰1.000,â€‰-â€‰0.550, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and sleeve gastrectomy (WMDâ€‰-â€‰0.920, 95% CIâ€‰-â€‰1.368,â€‰-â€‰0.473, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). In a sub-analysis according to the follow-up duration there was similarly a significant reduction in TyG index for bothâ€‰<â€‰12 months (WMDâ€‰-â€‰1.645, 95% CIâ€‰-â€‰2.123,â€‰-â€‰1.167, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), andâ€‰â‰¥â€‰12 months follow-up (WMDâ€‰-â€‰0.954, 95% CIâ€‰-â€‰1.606,â€‰-â€‰0.303, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The results of this meta-analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the TyG index following bariatric surgery, indicating improved insulin sensitivity and metabolic health. These findings highlight the potential of bariatric surgery as a valuable therapeutic option for individuals with obesity and its metabolic consequences.",10.1007/s11695-023-06992-7,,,,327
235,"FOOD TOLERANCE AND NUTRITIONAL RISK AFTER SLEEVE GASTRECTOMY AND ROUX-EN-Y GASTRIC BYPASS IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH SEVERE OBESITY: A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL.","Bariatric surgery is still controversial in elderly patients with severe obesity. Most publications focus on safety and early clinical outcomes. Food tolerance and nutritional postoperative risk is unknown for this population. Thirty-six elderly patients with severe obesity were recruited for an open-label randomized trial from September 2017 to May 2019 comparing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) to Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB). Food tolerance was accessed by Quality of Alimentation (QoA) questionnaire and data on weight loss, body composition, and nutritional risk were collected between 6 and 24 months after surgery. Comparing LSG to LRYGB patients, the latter had higher total weight loss (22% vs 31%, P=0.01) and excess weight loss (53% vs 68%, P=0.01). Food tolerance to eight food groups was similar between groups (14 vs 15 points, P=0.270), as Suter score (23 vs 25, P=0.238). Daily protein intake was below recommendation in both groups (40 vs 51 g/d, P=0.105). Nutritional risk, evaluated through Standardized Phase Angle (-1.48 vs -1.99, P=0.027), was worse for LRYGB group. Food tolerance and adequacy of food consumption were similar in both groups.

Demographic data, perioperative characteristics, and follow-up data were entered prospectively in the hospital's database for bariatric patients. We performed 325 primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) operations, one open RYGB, and 34 revisions. Mean BMI before the operations was 47.5 Â± 7.8 kg/m2 (31.5-91.0 kg/m2). The percentage of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was high; 52.3% (170 patients). The mean operative time decreased from 110 minutes during the first 108 operations to 82 minutes for the second 108 operations, and to 74 minutes for the last 109 operations (P < 0.001). Postoperative hospital stay was significantly reduced (P < 0.001) for the last 109 patients compared to the first and second group of patients. Overall morbidity averaged 19.1% (62/325). Severe complications were detected in 15 patients (4.6%). There was a tendency to more serious complications in the first group of patients. There was one death (mortality 0.3%). With a follow-up rate of 97% at 3 months T2DM had resolved in 48.2%, and had resolved or improved in a minimum of 92.9% of the diabetic patients. Weight loss (WL) and excess weight loss (EWL) averaged 20% and 46% respectively. Operative time and postoperative hospital stay decrease significantly with increasing experience. The first one hundred patients may be at higher risk for complications. LRYGB operations may have an important impact on the resolution of T2DM in the operated population.",10.1177/145749691210100308,,,,329
1512,"The effect of a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet on post laparoscopic gastric bypass weight loss: a prospective randomized trial.","Laparoscopic gastric bypass has become the standard surgical treatment for severe obesity in the United States. Less clear is what diet should be followed by these patients after surgery to maximize their weight loss. Patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass procedures for morbid obesity were randomly assigned to either a low-fat control diet based on American Heart Association recommendations or a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet based on the South Beach Diet. One-on-one diet counseling with a bariatric nutritionist was provided preoperatively, postoperatively while in the hospital, and at postoperative clinic visits during the 12-month follow-up period. Investigators were blinded to diet assignment. Body composition including Body Mass Index (BMI) was recorded preoperatively and during postoperative visits at 3, 6, and 12 months. Thirty-two patients were included in the analysis with 13 control and 19 low-carbohydrate, high-protein subjects. No demographic or clinical preoperative variables, including preoperative BMI, showed statistical differences between the two groups. Both groups demonstrated significant yet similar weight loss both by reduction in BMI (at 12 months, low fat diet, -14.0 +/- 5.5% versus low carbohydrate, -17.0 +/- 4.5%; P = 0.15) and excess body weight lost (at 12 months, low-fat diet, -60.3 +/- 15.3% versus low carbohydrate, -59.6 +/- 13.0%; P = 0.96). Based on this limited prospective study, no weight loss advantage is observed in substituting a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet in place of a standard low-fat diet in patients who have undergone laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery.",10.1016/j.jss.2007.02.052,,,,330
1335,"Omentectomy added to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery: a randomized, controlled trial.","Excess visceral adipose tissue predicts for incipient diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Human data are mixed regarding the benefits of selective visceral adipose tissue reduction. We investigated the effects of omentectomy added to laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on glucose homeostasis and lipids, inflammatory markers, and adipokines 90 days postoperatively in nondiabetic patients at the Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital and Oregon Health and Science University (Portland, OR). A single-blind, randomized study of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass plus omentectomy versus laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass alone in 28 subjects (7 men and 21 women). The groups were matched at baseline for gender, age, and body mass index (BMI). The eligibility criteria included age â‰¥18 years, BMI â‰¥40 and <50 kg/m(2) without co-morbid conditions or BMI â‰¥35 and <50 kg/m(2) with co-morbid conditions. The primary outcome measures were changes in the fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and homostatic model assessment of insulin resistance. The secondary measures were BMI and the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin, total and high-molecular-weight adiponectin, fibrinogen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels. After surgery, the BMI decreased significantly in both groups and was not different at the follow-up point. Although many outcome parameters improved with weight loss in both groups postoperatively, only the omentectomy group experienced statistically significant decreases in fasting glucose (P < .05), total (P = .004) and very-low-density lipoprotein (P = .001) cholesterol, and an increase in the high-molecular-weight/total adiponectin ratio (P = .013). Omentectomy added to laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass results in favorable changes in glucose homeostasis, lipid levels, and adipokine profile at 90 days postoperatively.

587,"Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy Versus Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Weight Loss, Comorbidities, and Biochemical Outcomes From Randomized Controlled Trials.","The aim of this study was to compare weight loss, obesity-related comorbidities, and biochemical outcomes of LSG versus LRYGB through a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). LSG and LRYGB are the 2 most commonly performed bariatric surgeries for the treatment of obesity. The comparative outcomes of the 2 surgeries is a topic of ongoing debate and medium-term outcomes remain uncertain. A search for RCTs comparing LRYGB versus LSG was conducted. Pooled outcomes between 2 procedures were compared using pairwise random-effects meta-analysis at 1, 3, and 5-year follow-up time points. Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation was used to assess certainty of evidence. Thirty-three studies involving 2475 patients were included. LRYGB resulted in greater loss of body mass index compared to LSG at 1 year [mean difference -1.25â€Škg/m2, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.01 to -0.49, P = 0.001; moderate certainty of evidence] which persisted at 3 years, but there was insufficient evidence at 5 years. Resolution of dyslipidemia was higher for LRYGB than LSG at 1 year (risk ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.46-0.73, P < 0.001; moderate certainty of evidence) and 5 years (risk ratio 0.68, 95%CI 0.46-0.99, P = 0.04; low certainty of evidence). There was no difference between LRYGB and LSG for remission of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hemoglobin A1c, fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, high-density lipoprotein, and the rate of 30-day major and minor complications.

443,Effect of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy vs Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass on Weight Loss and Quality of Life at 7 Years in Patients With Morbid Obesity: The SLEEVEPASS Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is currently the predominant bariatric procedure, although long-term weight loss and quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes compared with laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) are lacking. To determine weight loss equivalence of LSG and LRYGB at 7 years in patients with morbid obesity, with special reference to long-term QoL. The SLEEVE vs byPASS (SLEEVEPASS) multicenter, multisurgeon, open-label, randomized clinical equivalence trial was conducted between March 10, 2008, and June 2, 2010, in Finland. The trial enrolled 240 patients with morbid obesity aged 18 to 60 years who were randomized to undergo either LSG or LRYGB with a 7-year follow-up (last follow-up, September 26, 2017). Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Statistical analysis was performed from June 4, 2018, to November 8, 2019. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (nâ€‰=â€‰121) or LRYGB (nâ€‰=â€‰119). The primary end point was percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) at 5 years. Secondary predefined follow-up time points were 7, 10, 15, and 20 years, with included 7-year secondary end points of QoL and morbidity. Disease-specific QoL (DSQoL; Moorehead-Ardelt Quality of Life questionnaire [range of scores, -3 to 3 points, where a higher score indicates better QoL]) and general health-related QoL (HRQoL; 15D questionnaire [0-1 scale for all 15 dimensions, with 1 indicating full health and 0 indicating death]) were measured preoperatively and at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years postoperatively concurrently with weight loss. Of 240 patients (167 women [69.6%]; mean [SD] age, 48.4 [9.4] years; mean [SD] baseline body mass index, 45.9 [6.0]), 182 (75.8%) completed the 7-year follow-up. The mean %EWL was 47% (95% CI, 43%-50%) after LSG and 55% (95% CI, 52%-59%) after LRYGB (difference, 8.7 percentage units [95% CI, 3.5-13.9 percentage units]). The mean (SD) DSQoL total score at 7 years was 0.50 (1.14) after LSG and 0.49 (1.06) after LRYGB (Pâ€‰=â€‰.63), and the median HRQoL total score was 0.88 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.78-0.95) after LSG and 0.87 (IQR, 0.78-0.95) after LRYGB (Pâ€‰=â€‰.37). Greater weight loss was associated with better DSQoL (râ€‰=â€‰0.26; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). At 7 years, mean (SD) DSQoL scores improved significantly compared with baseline (LSG, 0.50 [1.14] vs 0.10 [0.94]; and LRYGB, 0.49 [1.06] vs 0.12 [1.12]; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001), unlike median HRQoL scores (LSG, 0.88 [IQR, 0.78-0.95] vs 0.87 [IQR, 0.78-0.90]; and LRYGB, 0.87 [IQR, 0.78-0.92] vs 0.85 [IQR, 0.77-0.91]; Pâ€‰=â€‰.07). The overall morbidity rate was 24.0% (29 of 121) for LSG and 28.6% (34 of 119) for LRYGB (Pâ€‰=â€‰.42). This study found that LSG and LRYGB were not equivalent in %EWL at 7 years. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass resulted in greater weight loss than LSG, but the difference was not clinically relevant based on the prespecified equivalence margins. There was no difference in long-term QoL between the procedures. Bariatric surgery was associated with significant long-term DSQoL improvement, and greater weight loss was associated with better DSQoL.

993,Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Versus Medical Treatment for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Obese Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"The aim of the study is to compare Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery versus medical treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in obese patients.Bariatric surgery can achieve remission of T2DM in obese patients. RYGB surgery has been performed as one of the most common surgical treatment options for obese patients with T2DM, but the efficacy of RYGB surgery comparing with medical treatment alone has not been conclusively determined.A systematic literature search identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating RYGB surgery versus medical treatment for T2DM in obese patients was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database, and Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry. This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The primary outcome was T2DM remission. Additional analyses comprised hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, serum lipid level, blood pressure, medication use, and adverse events. Random-effects meta-analyses were calculated and presented as weighted odds ratio (OR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).Six RCTs concerning 410 total obese T2DM patients were included. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 60 months. RYGB surgery was associated with a higher T2DM remission rate (OR: 76.37, 95% CI: 20.70-281.73, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001) and serum level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD: 0.24â€Šmmol/L, 95% CI 0.18-0.30â€Šmmol/L, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001) than medical treatment alone. HbA1c (MD: -1.25%, 95% CI: -1.88% to -0.63%, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001), BMI (MD: -6.54â€Škg/m, 95% CI: -9.28 to -3.80â€Škg/m, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001), waist circumference (MD: -15.60â€Šcm, 95% CI: -18.21 to -13.00â€Šcm, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001), triglyceride (MD: -0.87â€Šmmol/L, 95% CI: -1.17 to -0.57â€Šmmol/L, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD: -0.32â€Šmmol/L, 95% CI: -0.62 to -0.02â€Šmmol/L, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.04), systolic blood pressure (MD: -2.83 mm Hg, 95% CI: -4.88 to -0.78 mm Hg, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.01) were lower after RYGB surgery. However, FPG (MD: -1.58â€Šmmol/L, 95% CI: -3.58 to 0.41â€Šmmol/L, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.12), total cholesterol (MD: -0.40â€Šmmol/L, 95% CI: -0.92 to 0.12â€Šmmol/L, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.13), and diastolic blood pressure (MD: 0.28 mm Hg, 95% CI: -1.89 to 2.45â€Šmm Hg, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.80) were not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups. The medicine use and quality of life were solely improved in the surgical group. Nutritional deficiencies and anemia were noted more frequently in the RYGB group.RYGB surgery is superior to medical treatment for short- to medium-term remission of T2DM, improvement of metabolic condition, and cardiovascular risk factors. Further RCTs should address the safety and long-term benefits of RYGB surgery on obese patients with T2DM.",10.1097/MD.0000000000003462,,,,335
804,Should Roux-en-Y gastric bypass biliopancreatic limb length be tailored to achieve improved diabetes outcomes?,"The objective is to access the role of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) biliopancreatic limb (BPL) length in type 2 diabetes (T2D) outcomes.RYGB is more effective than medical intervention for T2D treatment in obese patients. Despite the scarcity of available data, previous reports suggest that modifications of the RYGB limb lengths could improve the antidiabetic effects of the surgery.A cohort of obese T2D patients (nâ€Š=â€Š114) were submitted to laparoscopic RYGB, either with a standard BPL (SBPL) (nâ€Š=â€Š41; BPL 84â€ŠÂ±â€Š2â€Šcm) or long BPL (LBPL) (nâ€Š=â€Š73; BPLâ€Š=â€Š200â€Šcm) and routinely monitored for weight loss and diabetic status up to 5 years after surgery.Baseline clinical features in the 2 patient subgroups were similar. After surgery, there was a significant reduction of body mass index (BMI) in both the groups, although the percentage of excess BMI loss (%EBMIL) after 5 years was higher for LBPL (75.50â€ŠÂ±â€Š2.63 LBPL vs 65.90â€ŠÂ±â€Š3.61 SBPL, Pâ€Š=â€Š.04). T2D remission rate was also higher (73% vs 55%, Pâ€Š<â€Š.05), while disease relapse rate (13.0% vs 32.5%; Pâ€Š<â€Š.05) and antidiabetic drug requirement in patients with persistent diabetes were lower after LBPL. Preoperative T2D duration predicted disease remission, but only for SBPL.RYGB with a longer BPL improves %EBMIL, T2D remission, and glycemic control in those with persistent disease, while it decreases diabetes relapse rate over time. The antidiabetic effects of LBPL RYGB also are less influenced by the preoperative disease duration. These data suggest the RYGB procedure could be tailored to improve T2D outcomes.",10.1097/MD.0000000000008859,,,,336

This disease remains largely refractory to diet and drug therapy, but generally responds well to bariatric surgery. To determine the impact of bariatric surgery on weight loss, operative mortality outcome, and 4 obesity comorbidities (diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea). Electronic literature search of MEDLINE, Current Contents, and the Cochrane Library databases plus manual reference checks of all articles on bariatric surgery published in the English language between 1990 and 2003. Two levels of screening were used on 2738 citations. A total of 136 fully extracted studies, which included 91 overlapping patient populations (kin studies), were included for a total of 22,094 patients. Nineteen percent of the patients were men and 72.6% were women, with a mean age of 39 years (range, 16-64 years). Sex was not reported for 1537 patients (8%). The baseline mean body mass index for 16 944 patients was 46.9 (range, 32.3-68.8). A random effects model was used in the meta-analysis. The mean (95% confidence interval) percentage of excess weight loss was 61.2% (58.1%-64.4%) for all patients; 47.5% (40.7%-54.2%) for patients who underwent gastric banding; 61.6% (56.7%-66.5%), gastric bypass; 68.2% (61.5%-74.8%), gastroplasty; and 70.1% (66.3%-73.9%), biliopancreatic diversion or duodenal switch. Operative mortality (< or =30 days) in the extracted studies was 0.1% for the purely restrictive procedures, 0.5% for gastric bypass, and 1.1% for biliopancreatic diversion or duodenal switch. Diabetes was completely resolved in 76.8% of patients and resolved or improved in 86.0%. Hyperlipidemia improved in 70% or more of patients. Hypertension was resolved in 61.7% of patients and resolved or improved in 78.5%. Obstructive sleep apnea was resolved in 85.7% of patients and was resolved or improved in 83.6% of patients. Effective weight loss was achieved in morbidly obese patients after undergoing bariatric surgery.

533,Weight Outcomes of Sleeve Gastrectomy and Gastric Bypass Compared to Nonsurgical Treatment.,"To investigate weight trajectories among patients with severe obesity undergoing sleeve gastrectomy (SG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and nonsurgical treatment. Although bariatric procedures are associated with substantial weight loss, few studies have compared surgical outcomes to nonsurgical treatment, particularly for SG. In this retrospective, matched cohort study, adult patients with body mass index â‰¥35â€Škg/m2 who underwent RYGB or SG procedures from January 2005 through September 2015 were matched to 87,965 nonsurgical patients. Hierarchical linear models were used to investigate percent total weight loss (%TWL) and regain at 5 years among RYGB, SG, and nonsurgical patients, and at 10 years for RYGB and nonsurgical patients. Among 13,900 SG, 17,258 RYGB, and 87,965 nonsurgical patients, the 5-year follow-up rate was 70.9%, 72.0%, and 64.5%, respectively. At 1 year, RYGB patients had 28.4%TWL (95% confidence interval: 28.2, 28.5), SG 23.0%TWL (22.8, 23.2), and nonsurgical patients 0.2%TWL (0.1, 0.4). At 5 years, RYGB had 21.7%TWL (21.5, 22.0), SG 16.0%TWL (15.4, 16.6), and nonsurgical patients 2.2%TWL (2.0, 2.5). After 5 years, 3.7% of RYGB and 10.1% of SG patients had regained weight to within 5% of baseline. At 10 years, RYGB patients had 20.2%TWL (19.3, 21.0) and nonsurgical patients 4.8%TWL (4.0, 5.5). In this study, patients with severe obesity who underwent SG and RYGB lost significantly more weight at 5 years than nonsurgical patients. Weight regain was common after surgery but regain to within 5% of baseline was rare.",10.1097/SLA.0000000000003826,,,,338
193,Incidence and risk factors of symptomatic Petersen's hernias in bariatric and upper gastrointestinal surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the actual incidence of symptomatic Petersen's hernias (PH) as well as identify risk factors for their occurrence. Search was performed in Medline (via PubMed), Web of Science, and Cochrane library, using the keywords ""Petersen Or Petersen's AND hernia"" and ""Internal hernia."" Only studies of symptomatic PH were eligible. Fifty-three studies matched our criteria and were included. Risk of bias for each study was independently assessed using the checklist modification by Hoy et al. Analysis was performed using random-effects models, with subsequent subgroup analyses. A total of 81,701 patients were included. Mean time interval from index operation to PH diagnosis was 17.8Â months. Total small bowel obstruction (SBO) events at Petersen's site were 737 (0.7%). SBO incidence was significantly higher in patients without defect closure (1.2% vs 0.3%, pâ€‰<â€‰0.01), but was not significantly affected by anastomosis fashion (retrocolic 0.7% vs antecolic 0.8%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.99). SBO incidence was also not significantly affected by the surgical approach (laparoscopicâ€‰=â€‰0.7% vs openâ€‰=â€‰0.1%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.18). However, retrocolic anastomosis was found to be associated with marginally, but not significantly, increased SBO rate in patients with Petersen's space closure, compared with the antecolic anastomosis (pâ€‰=â€‰0.09). PH development may occur after any gastric operation with gastrojejunal anastomosis. Contrary to anastomosis fashion and surgical approach, defect closure was demonstrated to significantly reduce SBO incidence. Limitations of this study may include the high heterogeneity and the possible publication bias across the included studies.",10.1007/s00423-023-02798-4,,,,339
281,"Sleeve gastrectomy versus Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass for remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus at 1, 3 and 5 years: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) are the two procedures used in the management of patient with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); however, it is still unclear which of the two is more efficient in the remission of type-2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to analyze the efficiency of RYGB and SG in the remission of type-2 diabetes mellitus after 1, 3 and 5 years of surgery. Three databases (i.e., PubMed, Scopus, Central and Web of Science) were searched. All randomized control trial studies with at least 12-year follow-up were selected with type-2 diabetes mellitus in patients undergoing Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. The broad and the narrow criteria were lined with individual patients reported, being analyzed and pooled using the random-effects model. The 15 selected articles, including 707 obese type 2 diabetes patients, met the eligibility criteria for this meta-analysis. RYGB when compared with SG shows increased broad remissions (RR=1.43, 95% CI: 1.13-1.80; P=0.003) and narrow remissions (RR=1.32, 95% CI: 1.15-1.58; P=0.003) after one year of surgery, and broad remissions 5 years after surgery (RR=1.58, 95% CI: 0.97-2.56; P=0.06). No significant difference was identified between the two groups in broad and narrow remissions 3 years after surgery and narrow remissions 5 years after surgery. Our results suggest that RYGB was more effective in the remission of type-2 diabetes mellitus at 1 year and 5 years considering the broad and narrow criteria, while there was no difference found 3 years after surgery.",10.23736/S2724-5985.22.03117-5,,,,340
195,Incidence of self-harm after bariatric surgery: A nationwide registry-based matched cohort study.,"The aims of this study were to evaluate the longitudinal risk of self-harm and the risk factors for self-harm after bariatric surgery in patients and control subjects without prior self-harm. This observational cohort study was based on prospectively registered data. Patients 18-70â€‰years at time of surgery, body mass index (BMI) >â€‰30â€‰kg/m2 , who underwent a primary Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedure or a primary sleeve gastrectomy between 2007 and 2019 were considered for inclusion. All patients who met the inclusion criteria were matched 1:10 to the general population in Sweden (69â€‰492 patients vs. 694â€‰920 controls). After excluding patients and controls with previous self-harm, a self-harm event occurred in 1408 patients in the surgical group (incidence rate (IR) 3.54/1000 person-years, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.36-3.73) versus in 3162 patients in the control group (IR 0.81/1000 person-years, 95% CI 0.78-0.84), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 4.38 (95% CI 4.11-4.66, pâ€‰<â€‰.001). Median follow-up time was 6.1â€‰years. Risk factors were younger age, lower BMI, cardiovascular, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, all aspects of psychiatric comorbidities (except neuropsychiatric disorder), lower socioeconomic status, RYGB, lower health-related quality of life, lower postoperative weight loss, and not attending postoperative follow-up visits. Self-harm is clearly higher after bariatric surgery than in the general population. A qualitative follow-up may be particularly important for patients at increased risk.",10.1111/cob.12576,,,,341
62,Safety and Efficacy of LSG Versus LRYGB on Patients with Obesity: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis from RCTs.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) are the two most frequently performed techniques in treating obesity and its related comorbidities. We aimed to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of LSG with LRYGB in terms of short- and mid-term outcomes of weight loss, obesity-related comorbidities, and post-operative complications via a meta-analysis of RCTs. Clinical comparative RCTs on LSG and LRYGB were searched through PubMed, MEDLINE, and Web of Science databases from inception to August 2022. Pooled outcomes from the selected studies were discussed by the random-effect meta-analysis method. Quality assessment and risk of bias for selected RCTs were implemented, and all the statistical analyses were performed. Twenty studies, including 1270 patients, were enrolled. Meta-analysis results indicated the great superior efficacy of LRYGB to LSG in BMI loss at 6 (MD -1.35Â kg/m2, 95% CI: -2.07 to -0.62, pâ€‰=â€‰0.0003), 12Â months (MD -1.09Â kg/m2, 95% CI: -1.86 to -0.33, pâ€‰=â€‰0.005), and 36Â months (MD -1.47Â kg/m2, 95% CI: -2.77 to -0.16, pâ€‰=â€‰0.03) as well as %EWL gaining at 36Â months. Significantly higher remission rates of T2DM and dyslipidemia were achieved by LRYGB at 12Â months. Besides, better improvements for T2DM-related and lipid biochemical parameters were found favoring LRYGB. However, LSG resulted in a lower post-operative complication rate and shorter operating time. Present meta-analysis results suggested that LRYGB was superior to LSG concerning short- and mid-term weight loss, short-term T2DM remission efficacy, and related biochemical parameters. LSG is favored for obviously fewer complications and shorter operating time.",10.1007/s11695-024-07076-w,,,,342
450,Laparoscopic gastric bypass versus lifestyle intervention for adolescents with morbid obesity.,"There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in adolescents, and the associated complications. The main objective of the 4XL study was to clarify whether laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LGBP) combined with lifestyle intervention is a safe and effective treatment method. Data were retrieved from an ongoing non-randomised intervention study of adolescents with morbid obesity that is comparing the effects of gastric bypass combined with lifestyle intervention versus lifestyle intervention alone. Altogether 39Â patients (64Â % girls) treated with a gastric bypass, and 96Â patients (57Â % girls) treated with lifestyle intervention were examined prior to the start of treatment and one year later. The average age at inclusion (SD) was 16.7 (1.0) years vs. 15.6 (1.3) years, and average BMI was 45.6 (4.4) vs. 43.3 (4.1) kg/m2 in the two groups. Average (95Â % CI) percentage weight loss was 30Â % (27Â %-33Â %) after surgery versus weight gain of 1Â % (-1Â % to 3Â %) in the control group. The difference between the groups was 31Â % (95Â % CI 27Â %-34Â %, p<0.001). Cardiometabolic risk factors improved only after surgery. After gastric bypass, two early (<6 weeks) minor complications were recorded. One year after surgery, 4 (10Â %), 8 (21Â %) and 4 (10Â %) of patients had anaemia, iron deficiency or low vitamin B12 levels respectively, and 20 of 33Â patients (61Â %) had low two-hour blood glucose (<2.8Â mmol/l) after oral glucose tolerance testing. The results support previous studies showing that gastric bypass is associated with significant weight loss in adolescent patients with morbid obesity. The 4XL study is currently too small and the follow-up time too short to allow the risk of long-term complications to be assessed.",10.4045/tidsskr.20.0526,,,,343
791,Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is an effective bridge to kidney transplantation: Results from a single center.,"Body mass index (BMI)Â >Â 35-40Â kg/m2 is often a contraindication, while Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is performed to enable kidney transplantation. This single-center retrospective study evaluated pre- and post-transplant outcomes of 31 morbidly obese patients with end-stage renal disease having RYGB before kidney transplantation between July 2009 and June 2014. Fourteen RYGB patients were subsequently transplanted. Nineteen recipients not having GB with a BMIÂ â‰¥Â 36Â kg/m2 at transplantation were used as historical controls. Mean BMI (Â±SE) before RYGB was 43.5Â Â±Â 0.7Â kg/m2 (range: 35.4-50.5Â kg/m2 ); 87.1% (27/31) achieved a BMIÂ <Â 35Â kg/m2 . The percentage having improved diabetes/hypertension control was 29.0% (9/31); 25.8% (8/31) had complications (mostly minor) after RYGB. Among transplanted patients, blacks/Hispanics comprised 78.6% (11/14) and 84.2% (16/19) of RYGB and controls; 57.1% (8/14) and 63.2% (12/19) had a (mostly long-standing) pretransplant history of diabetes. While biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) occurred significantly higher among RYGB vs control patients (6/14 vs 3/19, PÂ =Â .03), patients developing T-cell BPAR were also significantly more likely to have a tacrolimus (TAC) trough levelÂ <Â 4.0Â ng/mL within 3Â weeks of T-cell BPAR (PÂ =Â .0007). In Cox's model, the impact of having a TAC levelÂ <Â 4.0Â ng/mg remained significant (PÂ =Â .007) while the effect of RYGB was no longer significant (PÂ =Â .13). Infections, graft, and patient survival were not significantly different. Despite obvious effectiveness in achieving weight loss, RYGB will need more careful post-transplant monitoring given the observed higher BPAR rate.",10.1111/ctr.13232,,,,344
1458,Two-year changes in health-related quality of life in gastric bypass patients compared with severely obese controls.,"Few weight loss surgery trials have evaluated the changes in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) relative to obese individuals not participating in weight loss interventions. In a prospective study at a bariatric surgery practice, we evaluated the 2-year changes in HRQOL in gastric bypass patients compared with 2 severely obese groups who did not undergo surgical weight loss. A total of 308 gastric bypass patients were compared with 253 individuals who sought but did not undergo gastric bypass and 272 population-based obese individuals using the weight-related (Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite) and general (Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey) HRQOL questionnaires at baseline and 2 years of follow-up. The percentage of weight loss was 34.2% for the gastric bypass and 1.4% for the no gastric bypass groups, with a .5% gain for population-based obese group. Both measures of HRQOL showed greater improvements for the gastric bypass group, even after controlling for baseline differences. Effect sizes for changes in physical and weight-related HRQOL were very large for gastric bypass, but small to medium for the 2 comparison groups. Effect sizes for changes in the psychosocial aspects of HRQOL were moderate to very large for gastric bypass, but small for the 2 comparison groups. Of the gastric bypass patients, 97% had meaningful improvements in the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite total score compared with 43% of the no gastric bypass group and 30% of the population-based obese group. Dramatic improvements had occurred in weight-related and physical HRQOL for gastric bypass patients at 2 years after surgery compared with 2 severely obese groups who had not undergone surgery. These results support the effectiveness of gastric bypass surgery in improving patients' HRQOL.",10.1016/j.soard.2009.01.009,,,,345
363,A safety study of laparoscopic single-anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with gastric plication (SADI-GP) in the management of morbid obesity.,"Bariatric surgery is more effective in the management of morbid obesity and related comorbidities than is conservative therapy. Pylorus-preserving single-anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-SG) is a modified duodenal switch technique. Gastric plication (GP) is an alternate to SG. Morbidly obese (BMI ofâ€‰>â€‰40, orâ€‰>â€‰35 in the presence of diabetes or prediabetes) patients were recruited and operated on to perform SADI with GP. Complications related to surgery were recorded to assess the feasibility of the procedure. Weight-loss outcomes were analysed to determine efficacy. Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 2 (MMPI-2) was recorded after 1Â year of follow-up, and test scales were used to describe physiological phenomena. Seventeen middle-aged (mean: 40Â years) patients were involved in our study; 15 of them were females. The mean duration of surgery was 205Â min. There were no complications of conversion, death, bleeding, VTE or 30-day readmission to hospital. We did experience CD4a (pulmonary insufficiency due to chronic lung disease) and a CD3b (anastomosis leakage treated laparoscopically) complications. Vomiting occurred in three cases (CD1). Obesity-related comorbidities showed favourable resolution rates (77.8% for hypertension, 81.2% for dyslipidaemia, 100% for diabetes at the 1-year follow-up). Weight-loss outcomes were favourable (53.20 EWL%, and 35.58 TWL% at 1-year follow-up). Greater weight loss caused significantly higher levels of Depression (t(13.958)â€‰=â€‰â€‰-â€‰2.373; pâ€‰=â€‰0.00; pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) and Low Positive Emotions (t(13.301)â€‰=â€‰â€‰-â€‰2.954; pâ€‰=â€‰0.00; pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) and Introversion/Low Positive Emotionality (t(13.408)â€‰=â€‰â€‰-â€‰1.914; pâ€‰=â€‰0.02; pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) in MMPI-2 data. According to our safety study, SADI-GP is a promising malabsorptive procedure, but a long-term high-volume case series or a randomised controlled trial is necessary to evaluate complication rates and weight-loss outcomes. Emotional dysregulation is common among bariatric surgery patients according to personality inventory data; therefore, psychological follow-up and psychotherapeutic support are necessary for weight-loss maintenance.",10.1007/s00423-021-02276-9,,,,346
659,Bone Turnover Markers After Standard and Distal Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: Results from a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is associated with increased risk of bone fractures. Malabsorptive procedures may be associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism and detrimental effects on bone health. We aimed to compare the effects of standard and distal gastric bypass on bone turnover markers 2Â years after surgery. Patients with body mass index (BMI) 50-60Â kg/m2 (nâ€‰=â€‰113) were randomized to standard or distal gastric bypass, 105 patients (95%) completed 2-year follow-up. Serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-1), procollagen type I N-propeptide (PINP), and bone-derived alkaline phosphatase (BALP) was measured at baseline and up to 2Â years after surgery. ANCOVA and linear mixed models were used to compare groups. The levels of bone turnover markers increased significantly in both groups, with no statistically significant difference between groups. Two years after standard and distal gastric bypass mean (SD) CTX-1 were 0.81 (0.32) and 0.83 (0.31) Î¼g/L (pâ€‰=â€‰0.38), mean PINP was 77.6 (23.2) and 77.7 (29.3) Î¼g/L (pâ€‰=â€‰0.42), and BALP 47.9 (21.9) vs. 50.7 (19.6) Î¼g/L (pâ€‰=â€‰0.38), respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that PINP and BALP correlated positively (pâ€‰=â€‰0.01 and pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) with PTH, but only BALP was significantly higher in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001). Type of surgery, vitamin D serum concentrations, and 2-year BMI were all independently associated with PTH levels. A comparable increase in bone turnover markers 2Â years after standard and distal gastric bypass was observed. There was a higher prevalence of secondary hyperparathyroidism after distal gastric bypass, but this did not impact bone turnover markers.

1354,Systematic review of 23-hour (outpatient) stay laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery.,"The laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is generally considered the gold-standard bariatric procedure. It has a usual inpatient stay of 3 days. There have been few reports of gastric bypass patients being discharged within 23 hours of surgery, but its safety and feasibility has not been reviewed before. The aim of this study was to review the published literature on 23-hour stay post-LRYGB. Systematic search was performed in Medline, Embase, and Cochrane library using the medical subject heading terms ""ambulatory surgical procedures"" and ""bariatric surgery"" with further free text search and cross references. All articles on 23-hour LRYGB that described patient selection criteria, 23-hour discharge, complications, and readmissions were reviewed. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers. There were no randomized controlled trials. Four cohort studies were included in this review. The patients age ranged from 14 to 70 years, mean body mass index ranged from 41.2 to 49.25, and the mean operative time ranged from 112.8 to 169 minutes. 1852/2201(84.14%) patients could be discharged within 23 hours. Forty-eight patients (2.18%) developed complications and 40 patients (1.82%) were readmitted. The commonest 30-day complications were anastomotic strictures (16), gastrointestinal bleeding (9), and internal hernias (9). Five patients developed anastomotic leak and 2 patients developed pulmonary embolism. Two patients died but neither was discharged after their bypass surgery. There is a paucity of data regarding 23-hour discharge after LRYGB. The evidence suggests that it is feasible in selected patients. However, further studies are necessary to assess its safety and acceptability.",10.1089/lap.2011.0042,,,,348
1496,Improvement of insulin resistance after obesity surgery: a comparison of gastric banding and bypass procedures.,"Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Insulin resistance (IR) is considered the pathologic link between T2DM and obesity. The mechanism in improving T2DM after bariatric surgery remains speculative. This trial assessed the effect of duodenal jejunal exclusion on the resolution of IR in gastric banding and gastric bypass procedures. 660 patients with complete biochemical and clinical data at baseline and at 3 years were selected for analysis. There were 197 males and 463 females. The mean age was 31.5 years (18-64) and mean BMI was 41.4 (32-77). There were 544 patients who received laparoscopic gastric bypass, and 116 patients received laparoscopic gastric banding. IR was measured by homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) index (HI), that can be calculated as HI = plasma glucose (mmol/l) x insulin (UI/ml)/22.5. HI was measured before surgery and 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after surgery. Of the 660 individuals, 517 (78.4%) had IR. The mean HI was 7.62 +/- 13.13. The HI was correlated with BMI, waist circumference, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, inflammatory indicators, and abnormal liver enzymes. Before surgery, the HI was 7.92 +/- 14.18 for the bypass group and 6.27 +/- 6.47 for the banding group. After surgery, the HI began to lower in both groups, and this reduction was maintained during follow-up. At 36 months after surgery, mean percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) was 70.5% for the bypass group and 41.9% for the banding group. The HI was 1.00 +/- 0.79 for bypass and 1.51 +/- 1.25 for banding. The bypass patients had a better and faster weight reduction, but the HI was similar between the two groups at the same weight reduction percentage. IR is common in morbidly obese patients. Both gastric banding and gastric bypass are effective for the reverse of IR in these patients. It seems that the effect is related to the absolute weight loss rather than different surgical procedures. There is no duodenal jejunal exclusion effect on IR resolution was observed in this study.",10.1007/s11695-008-9457-3,,,,349
821,Endoscopic Treatment of Weight Regain Following Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the most commonly performed bariatric procedure. Despite its high efficacy, some patients regain part of their lost weight. Several endoscopic therapies have been introduced as alternatives to treat weight regain, but most of the articles are relatively small with unclear long-term data. To systematically assess the efficacy of endoscopic therapies for weight regain after RYGB. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, OVID, CINAHL/EBSCo, LILACS/Bireme, and gray literature. Primary outcomes were absolute weight loss (AWL), excess weight loss (EWL), and total body weight loss (TBWL). Thirty-two studies were included in qualitative analysis. Twenty-six described full-thickness (FT) endoscopic suturing and pooled AWL, EWL, and TBWL at 3Â months were 8.5Â Â±Â 2.9Â kg, 21.6Â Â±Â 9.3%, and 7.3Â Â±Â 2.6%, respectively. At 6Â months, they were 8.6Â Â±Â 3.5Â kg, 23.7Â Â±Â 12.3%, and 8.0Â Â±Â 3.9%, respectively. At 12Â months, they were 7.63Â Â±Â 4.3Â kg, 16.9Â Â±Â 11.1%, and 6.6Â Â±Â 5.0%, respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that all outcomes were significantly higher in the group with FT suturing combined with argon plasma coagulation (APC) (pÂ <Â 0.0001). Meta-analysis included 15 FT studies and showed greater results. Three studies described superficial-thickness suturing with pooled AWL of 3.0Â Â±Â 3.8, 4.4Â Â±Â 0.07, and 3.7Â Â±Â 7.4Â kg at 3, 6, and 12Â months, respectively. Two articles described APC alone with mean AWL of 15.4Â Â±Â 2.0 and 15.4Â Â±Â 9.1Â kg at 3 and 6Â months, respectively. Full-thickness suturing is effective at treating weight regain after RYGB. Performing APC prior to suturing seems to result in greater weight loss. Head-to-head studies are needed to confirm our results. Few studies adequately assess effectiveness of other endoscopic techniques.",10.1007/s11695-017-2986-x,,,,350
692,Bariatric surgery in older adults: Should there be an age limit?,"Obesity has become one of the most significant health problems worldwide, affecting more than one-third of the global population. The elderly population is not immune to this proportional increase in obesity. To date, there is no cure for obesity, but surgery is the most effective treatment available today.We analyzed the results of bariatric surgery in elderly patients for a period of 3 years. Patients 65 years old and older were included in the study, 451 older adults were included. The mean age of the study group was 67.92 years old (min. 65, max. 84). The mean body mass index (BMI) was 40.32â€ŠKg/m (min. 34 and max. 59). Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) was the most common procedures, and were conducted in 346 (76.72%) patients, gastric bypasses (GBPs) in 53 (11.75%) of which 33 were roux en y GBP (7.32%) and 20 mini GBPs (4.43%), gastric banding in 48 (10.64%), and duodenal switching in 4 (0.89%) cases.There were 40 (8.86%) patients with perioperative complications, 6 (1.33%) required re-operations, 12 (2.66) patients with operative complications were treated conservatively, 8 (1.77%) re-admission 5 of them with intrabdominal abscess, and 14 (3.10%) with co-morbidities complications. More than 76% of the patients had co-morbidities, 1 year after surgery the average remission of diseases was 34.74%, the improvement was49.67% and no changes in the co-morbidities was 15.59%. There were no deaths reported in this cohort.The mean excess body weight (EBW) loss among the patients was 70.76% (from 32% to 92%). No failure of weight loss (less than 25% of EBW loss) was observed after the first postoperative year.Bariatric surgery offers obese elderly patients an acceptable result, and it can be offered to improve the quality of life of these patients. A new consensus conference panel is needed to set appropriate recommendations regarding criteria that limit bariatric surgery in older adults.",10.1097/MD.0000000000013824,,,,351
1500,Studies of Swedish adjustable gastric band and Lap-Band: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of the large body of data describing the Swedish adjustable gastric band (SAGB) and Lap-Band (LB). A systematic review was performed that included screening of studies published in any language (January 1, 1998 through April 30, 2006) identified through MEDLINE, Current Contents, or the Cochrane Library. Studies with > or =10 SAGB or LB patients reporting > or =30-day efficacy or safety outcomes were eligible for review; the data were extracted from the accepted studies. A weighted means analysis and random-effects meta-analysis of efficacy outcomes of interest were conducted. A total of 4592 bariatric surgery studies met the initial criteria. Of these studies, 129 (28,980 patients) were accepted (33 SAGB and 104 LB studies); most had a retrospective single-center design. For 4273 patients (36 treatment groups) in 33 SAGB studies and 24,707 patients (111 groups) in 104 LB studies, the mean baseline age (39.1-40.2 yr), body mass index (43.8-45.3 kg/m2), and gender (women 79.2-82.5%) were similar. A laparoscopic technique was used in > or =88% and a pars flaccida technique in > or =41% of both groups. Early mortality was equivalent for SAGB/LB (< or =.1%). The 3-year mean SAGB and LB excess weight loss (56.36% and 50.20%, respectively) and body mass index reduction (-11.99 and -11.81 kg/m2, respectively) from baseline were statistically significant (P <.05), as was the resolution of diabetes (61.45% and 60.29%, respectively) and hypertension (62.95% and 43.58%, respectively). Although scant and inconsistently reported data precluded direct statistical comparisons, the complication rates for the 2 devices appeared comparable. In 8 directly comparative studies, meta-analysis found a significantly greater absolute weight loss (P <.05) with the SAGB at 2 years (48.4 versus 41.9 kg, mean difference -4.84, 95% confidence interval -9.47 to -0.22), although no difference was found in the percentage of excess weight loss or change in body mass index. In a systematic review of the published world SAGB and LB data, at 1, 2, and 3 years, the weight loss, resolution of diabetes and hypertension, and complications appeared comparable.",10.1016/j.soard.2007.10.016,,,,352
477,What predicts the unsuccess of bariatric surgery? An observational retrospective study.,"Bariatric surgery (BS) has been recognized as an effective treatment for most patients with morbid obesity, but a variable range of patients failed to achieve a successful weight-loss. Controversial data are available about predictors of unsuccess. We aimed to retrospectively assess whether clinical baseline characteristics of patients submitted to sleeve gastrectomy (SL) or gastric bypass (GBP) were associated with unsuccessful weight-loss after 12 and 24-month follow-up. Three hundred patients who underwent BS from the 1st January 2016, with at least 24-months follow-up, were enrolled. Patients were divided according to their percentage of excess weight-loss (%EWL) eitherâ€‰<â€‰50% orâ€‰â‰¥â€‰50% after 12 and 24-month follow-up. None of the patients was lost at follow-up; 56 (18.7%) patients showed a %EWLâ€‰<â€‰50% at 24Â months. Age, neck circumference, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) were significantly higher, while total cholesterol and %EWL 6-months lower in those with %EWLâ€‰<â€‰50% at 12-months. Age, neck circumference, male and OSA rates were increased, while %EWL at 6-months lower in patients with %EWLâ€‰<â€‰50% at 24-months.

174,Risk factors of anastomosis-related difficult endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography following endoscopic ultrasound-guided gastro-gastrostomy using aÂ standardized protocol (with video).,"Little is known about how to perform the endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-directed transgastric endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP; EDGE) in patients with gastric bypass using lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMS). The aim was to assess the risk factors of anastomosis-related difficult ERCP. Observational single-center study. All patients who underwent an EDGE procedure in 2020-2022 following a standardized protocol were included. Risk factors for difficult ERCP, defined as the need of >5â€‰min LAMS dilation or failure to pass a duodenoscope in the second duodenum, were assessed. Forty-five ERCPs were performed in 31 patients (57.4Â Â±â€‰8.2â€‰years old, 38.7% male). The EUS procedure was done using a wire-guided technique (nÂ =â€‰28, 90.3%) for biliary stones (nÂ =â€‰22, 71%) in most cases. The location of the anastomosis was gastro-gastric (nÂ =â€‰24, 77.4%) and mainly in the middle-excluded stomach (nÂ =â€‰21, 67.7%) with an oblique axis (nÂ =â€‰22, 71%). The ERCP technical success was 96.8%. There were 10 difficult ERCPs (32.3%) due to timing (nÂ =â€‰8), anastomotic dilation (nÂ =â€‰8), or failure to pass (nÂ =â€‰3). By multivariable analysis adjusted by two-stage procedures, the risk factors for a difficult ERCP were the jejuno-gastric route (85.7% vs. 16.7%; odds ratio [ORa ] 31.875; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.649-616.155; PÂ =â€‰0.022), and the anastomosis to the proximal/distal excluded stomach (70% vs. 14.3%; ORa 22.667; 95% CI 1.676-306.570; PÂ =â€‰0.019). There was only one complication (3.2%) and one persistent gastro-gastric fistula (3.2%) in a median follow-up of 4â€‰months (2-18 months), with no weight regain (PÂ =â€‰0.465). The jejunogastric route and the anastomosis with the proximal/distal excluded stomach during the EDGE procedure increase the difficulty of ERCP.",10.1111/den.14544,,,,354
1325,Superior weight loss and lower HbA1c 3 years after duodenal switch compared with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass--a randomized controlled trial.,"Obesity is a rising threat to public health. The relative increase in the incidence of morbid obesity is most pronounced in the most severely obese. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) results in inferior weight loss in this group. Therefore, we have offered biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD/DS) as an alternative for this patient category. Our objective was to compare BPD/DS and RYGB in the surgical treatment of morbid obesity in patients with a body mass index (BMI) >48 kg/m(2). The setting was a university hospital in Sweden. In a controlled trial (registration number ISRCTN10940791), 47 patients (25 men, BMI 54.5 Â± 6.1 kg/m(2)) were randomized to RYGB (n = 23) or BPD/DS (n = 24). Biochemical data were collected preoperatively and 1 and 3 years postoperatively. A questionnaire addressing weight, general satisfaction, and gastrointestinal symptoms was distributed a median of 4 years postoperatively. Both procedures were safe. The duration of surgery and postoperative morphine consumption were greater after BPD/DS than after RYGB (157 versus 117 min and 140 versus 93 mg, respectively). BPD/DS resulted in greater weight loss than RYGB (-23.2 Â± 4.9 versus -16.2 Â± 6.9 BMI units or 80% Â± 15% versus 51% Â± 23% excess BMI loss, P <.001). BPD/DS yielded lower glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels at 3 years. More patients listed troublesome diarrhea and malodorous flatus in the questionnaire after BPD/DS, but no significant difference was seen (P = .078 and P = .073, respectively). BPD/DS produced superior weight results and lower glycated hemoglobin levels compared with RYGB in patients with a BMI >48 kg/m(2). Both operations yield high satisfaction rates. However, diarrhea tended to be more common after BPD/DS.",10.1016/j.soard.2012.01.014,,,,355
217,Endoscopic management of refractory leak and gastro-cutaneous fistula after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: a randomized controlled trial.,"Gastro-cutaneous fistula is a rare complication after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) with incidence of occurrence 1-2%. Most of gastro-cutaneous fistulae do not respond to conservative management and need intervention either surgically or endoscopically. This prospective randomized clinical study included referred patients who had LSG performed at our department or other centers, and complicated with post-LSG leak or gastro-cutaneous fistula between December/2019 and March/2021. Included patients were ASA Physical status I-II. Primary and secondary outcomes were recurrence of the fistula and mortality in each group after the intervention during the 18Â months follow-up period, respectively. Thirty patients were randomized into two groups: Surgery Group (SG, nâ€‰=â€‰15) and Endoscopy Group (EG, nâ€‰=â€‰15). Mean age of patients was 42.3â€‰Â±â€‰8.7 and 42.6â€‰Â±â€‰8.3Â years-old in SG and EG, respectively. Females constituted 73.3% and 80% in SG and EG, respectively. Median time-to-gastric leak post LSG was six (range: 4-7) days in both groups. SG patients were surgically managed with primary repair of the gastric fistula and gastrojejunostomy in 13 patients or converting SG into Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in two patients, while EG patients were endoscopically managed with stitching, stenting, stenting and dilation, and clipping and dilation in 5, 4, 4 and 2 patients, respectively. Incidence of recurrent leak during 1st week was significantly higher in SG than EG (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). No mortality reported in EG, while 2 patients died in SG (pâ€‰=â€‰0.48). Endoscopic intervention may offer a successful modality in managing post-LSG gastric leak and gastro-cutaneous fistula that do not respond to conservative measures in stable patients.",10.1007/s00464-022-09748-z,,,,356
999,Change in Pain and Physical Function Following Bariatric Surgery for Severe Obesity.,"The variability and durability of improvements in pain and physical function following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) are not well described. To report changes in pain and physical function in the first 3 years following bariatric surgery, and to identify factors associated with improvement. The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 is an observational cohort study at 10 US hospitals. Adults with severe obesity undergoing bariatric surgery were recruited between February 2005 and February 2009. Research assessments were conducted prior to surgery and annually thereafter. Three-year follow-up through October 2012 is reported. Bariatric surgery as clinical care. Primary outcomes were clinically meaningful presurgery to postsurgery improvements in pain and function using scores from the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) (ie, improvement of â‰¥5 points on the norm-based score [range, 0-100]) and 400-meter walk time (ie, improvement of â‰¥24 seconds) using established thresholds. The secondary outcome was clinically meaningful improvement using the Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (ie, improvement of â‰¥9.7 pain points and â‰¥9.3 function points on the transformed score [range, 0-100]). Of 2458 participants, 2221 completed baseline and follow-up assessments (1743 [78.5%] were women; median age was 47 years; median body mass index [BMI] was 45.9; 70.4% underwent RYGB; 25.0% underwent LAGB). At year 1, clinically meaningful improvements were shown in 57.6% (95% CI, 55.3%-59.9%) of participants for bodily pain, 76.5% (95% CI, 74.6%-78.5%) for physical function, and 59.5% (95% CI, 56.4%-62.7%) for walk time. Additionally, among participants with severe knee or disability (633), or hip pain or disability (500) at baseline, approximately three-fourths experienced joint-specific improvements in knee pain (77.1% [95% CI, 73.5%-80.7%]) and in hip function (79.2% [95% CI, 75.3%-83.1%]). Between year 1 and year 3, rates of improvement significantly decreased to 48.6% (95% CI, 46.0%-51.1%) for bodily pain and to 70.2% (95% CI, 67.8%-72.5%) for physical function, but improvement rates for walk time, knee and hip pain, and knee and hip function did not (P for all â‰¥.05). Younger age, male sex, higher income, lower BMI, and fewer depressive symptoms presurgery; no diabetes and no venous edema with ulcerations postsurgery (either no history or remission); and presurgery-to-postsurgery reductions in weight and depressive symptoms were associated with presurgery-to-postsurgery improvements in multiple outcomes at years 1, 2, and 3. Among a cohort of participants with severe obesity undergoing bariatric surgery, a large percentage experienced improvement, compared with baseline, in pain, physical function, and walk time over 3 years, but the percentage with improvement in pain and physical function decreased between year 1 and year 3. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00465829.",10.1001/jama.2016.3010,,,,357
23,Ligamentum Teres Augmentation for Hiatus Hernia Repair After Bariatric Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Hiatal hernia (HH) and symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease are common complications after metabolic bariatric surgery. This meta-analysis aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of ligamentum teres augmentation (LTA) for HH repair after metabolic and bariatric surgeries (MBS). CENTRAL, Embase, PubMed, and Scopus were searched for articles from their inception to September 2023 by 2 independent reviewers using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis system. Five studies met the eligibility criteria, with a total of 165 patients undergoing LTA for HH repair after MBS. The distribution of patients based on surgical procedures included 63% undergoing sleeve gastrectomy, 21% Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and 16% having one anastomosis gastric bypass. The pooled proportion of reflux symptoms before LTA was 77% (95% CI: 0.580-0.960; I2 = 89%, n = 106). A pooled proportion of overall postoperative symptoms was 25.6% (95% CI: 0.190-0.321; I2 = 0%, n = 44), consisting of reflux at 14.5% (95% CI: 0.078-0.212; I2 = 0%, n = 15). The pooled proportion of unsuccessful LTA outcomes was 12.5% (95% CI: 0.075-0.175; I2 = 0%, n = 21). Our meta-analysis demonstrated that LTA appears to be a safe and efficacious procedure in the management of HH after MBS.",10.1097/SLE.0000000000001295,,,,358
1660,Gastric surgery for morbid obesity. The Adelaide Study.,"The efficacy of three gastric restriction operations were compared in a prospective randomized study of 310 morbidly obese subjects. The median patient age was 34 years (range, 18 to 62 years). They were predominantly female (13:1) and had a median pre-operative weight that was 198% of their ideal weight (range, 160% to 318%). There was an equitable dispersion of perceived risk factors between the groups under study and there were no deaths during the perioperative period. Compliance with follow-up at 3 years was 91%. When success was defined as a loss of more than 50% of excess weight or a current pregnancy, the success rates at 3 years were 17% for gastrogastrostomy, 48% for vertical gastroplasty, and 67% for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (p less than 0.001). Although the gastric bypass operation took longer to perform, there were similar outcome patterns for the three groups during the postoperative period. We conclude that the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the preferred procedure for the surgical treatment of morbid obesity.",10.1097/00000658-199004000-00007,,,,359
171,Bariatric Surgery and Psychological Health: A Randomised Clinical Trial in Patients with Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes.,"This study investigated the impact of either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with silastic ring (SR-RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) types of bariatric surgery on psychological health and explored the role of pre-existing depressive symptoms on weight loss. A total of 114 participants with obesity and type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive SR-RYGB or SG at a single centre. Data from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), RAND 36-item Health Survey and body weight were collected before surgery and annually for 5Â years. Sixteen patients were lost to follow-up at 5Â years. Of the 98 patients who completed 5-year psychological follow-up assessments, 13 had mild to severe depressive symptoms (SR-RYGB nâ€‰=â€‰6, SG nâ€‰=â€‰7). SR-RYGB and SG resulted in similar psychological health improvement but percent weight loss at 5Â years was greater for SR-RYGB by 10.6% (95% CI: 7.2 to 14.0, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). Scores for depressive symptoms and most RAND-36 domains improved significantly from baseline to 5Â years in both groups. Patients with pre-existing depressive symptoms had similar percent weight loss at 5Â years compared to patients without depressive symptoms, irrespective of procedural type. Patients receiving either SR-RYGB or SG had comparable psychosocial functioning, which was maintained to 5Â years post-surgery. Pre-existing depressive symptoms did not affect weight loss achieved at 5Â years. These findings confirm previous longitudinal studies demonstrating that bariatric surgery is generally associated with improved psychosocial functioning.",10.1007/s11695-023-06537-y,,,,360
1134,Bariatric surgery and liver transplantation: a systematic review a new frontier for bariatric surgery.,"This study aims to conduct a systematic review on bariatric surgery (BS) for patients in the setting of liver transplantation (LT). A literature review was conducted on the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. Studies in the English language on adults reporting on BS prior to, during, or after LT were included. Eleven studies with 56 patients were retrieved. Two studies reported on BS before, two during, and seven after LT. Sleeve gastrectomy was the most common procedure, followed by Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, biliopancreatic diversion, and gastric banding. The overall mortality rate was nil in the early postoperative period and 5.3 % in the first postoperative year. The reoperation rate was 12.2 %.

1544,"Laparoscopic versus open gastric bypass for morbid obesity: a multicenter, prospective, risk-adjusted analysis from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program.","To compare laparoscopic versus open gastric bypass procedures with respect to 30-day morbidity and mortality rates, using multi-institutional, prospective, risk-adjusted data. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for weight loss is being performed with increasing frequency, partly driven by consumer demand. However, there are no multi-institutional, risk-adjusted, prospective studies comparing laparoscopic and open gastric bypass outcomes. A multi-institutional, prospective, risk-adjusted cohort study of patients undergoing laparoscopic and open gastric bypass procedures was performed from hospitals (n = 15) involved in the Private Sector Study of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP). Data points have been extensively validated, are based on standardized definitions, and were collected by nurse reviewers who are audited for accuracy. From 2000 to 2003, data from 1356 gastric bypass procedures was collected. The 30-day mortality rate was zero in the laparoscopic group (n = 401), and 0.6% in the open group (n = 955) (P = not significant). The 30-day complication rate was significantly lower in the laparoscopic group as compared with the open group: 7% versus 14.5% (P < 0.0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to control for potential confounding variables and showed that patients undergoing an open procedure were more likely to develop a complication, as compared with patients undergoing an laparoscopic procedure (odds ratio = 2.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.33-3.25). Propensity score modeling revealed similar results. A prediction model was derived, and variables that significantly predict higher complication rates after gastric bypass included an open procedure, a high ASA class (III, IV, V), functionally dependent patient, and hypertension as a comorbid illness. Multicenter, prospective, risk-adjusted data show that laparoscopic gastric bypass is safer than open gastric bypass, with respect to 30-day complication rate.",10.1097/01.sla.0000216784.05951.0b,,,,362
108,Comparing the safety and efficacy of sleeve gastrectomy versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in elderly (>60 years) with severe obesity: an umbrella systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Today, bariatric surgeons face the challenge of treating older adults with class III obesity. The indications and outcomes of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) versus sleeve gastrectomy (SG) also constitute a controversy. PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus were searched to retrieve systematic reviews/meta-analyses published by 1 March 2022. The selected articles were qualitatively evaluated using A Measurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR). An umbrella review included six meta-analyses retrieved from the literature. The risk of early-emerging and late-emerging complications decreased by 55% and 41% in the patients underwent SG than in those receiving RYGB, respectively. The chance of the remission of hypertension and obstructive sleep apnoea, respectively increased by 43% and 6%, but type-2 diabetes mellitus decreased by 4% in the patients underwent RYGB than in those receiving SG. RYGB also increased excess weight loss by 15.23% in the patients underwent RYGB than in those receiving SG. Lower levels of mortality and early-emerging and late-emerging complications were observed in the older adults undergoing SG than in those receiving RYGB, which was, however, more efficient in term of weight loss outcomes and recurrence of obesity-related diseases.",10.1097/JS9.0000000000000629,,,,363
741,The Reduction of Visceral Adipose Tissue after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Is more Pronounced in Patients with Impaired Glucose Metabolism.,"Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors and insulin resistance. The physiological mechanisms underlying the benefits of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) on glucose metabolism remain incompletely understood. The impact of RYGB on VAT was assessed among three groups of patients stratified by their glucose tolerance before surgery. Forty-four obese women were categorized into normoglycemia (nâ€‰=â€‰21), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, nâ€‰=â€‰18) and diabetes (nâ€‰=â€‰5) before surgery. Body composition measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was performed before surgery, 6Â months and 12Â months after. The three groups had comparable mean age (mean 38.6â€‰Â±â€‰SD 9.9) and BMI at baseline (41.9â€‰Â±â€‰4.3Â kg/m2). After 12Â months, total weight loss (mean 35.1%â€‰Â±â€‰7.5) and excess weight loss (91.1%â€‰Â±â€‰25.1) were similar between groups. Pre-surgery mean VAT was significantly higher in diabetes (mean 2495â€‰Â±â€‰616Â g) than in normoglycemia (1750â€‰Â±â€‰617Â g, pâ€‰=â€‰0.02). The percentage of VAT to total body fat was significantly higher in diabetes (mean 4.4%â€‰Â±â€‰0.9) compared to normoglycemia (2.9%â€‰Â±â€‰0.8, pâ€‰=â€‰0.003). Twelve months after surgery, VAT loss was significantly greater among patients with diabetes (mean 1927â€‰Â±â€‰413Â g) compared to normoglycemia (1202â€‰Â±â€‰450, pâ€‰=â€‰0.009). RYGB leads to important VAT loss, and this loss is greater in patients with diabetes prior to surgery. As VAT is associated with insulin resistance, this reduction may account for the profound impact of this surgery on glucose metabolism.",10.1007/s11695-018-3455-x,,,,364
1391,Gastric bypass vs sleeve gastrectomy for type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized controlled trial.,"To determine the efficacies of 2 weight-reducing operations on diabetic control and the role of duodenum exclusion. Double-blind randomized controlled trial. Department of Surgery of the Min-Sheng General Hospital, National Taiwan University. We studied 60 moderately obese patients (body mass index >25 and <35) aged >30 to <60 years who had poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (hemoglobin A(1c) [HbA(1c)] >7.5%) after conventional treatment (>6 months) from September 1, 2007, through June 30, 2008. Patients and observers were masked during the follow-up, which ended in 2009, 1 year after final enrollment. Gastric bypass with duodenum exclusion (n = 30) vs sleeve gastrectomy without duodenum exclusion (n = 30). The primary outcome was remission of T2DM (fasting glucose <126 mg/dL and HbA(1c) <6.5% without glycemic therapy). Secondary measures included weight and metabolic syndrome. Analysis was by intention to treat. Of the 60 patients enrolled, all completed the 12-month follow-up. Remission of T2DM was achieved by 28 (93%) in the gastric bypass group and 14 (47%) in the sleeve gastrectomy group (P = .02). Participants assigned to gastric bypass had lost more weight, achieved a lower waist circumference, and had lower glucose, HbA(1c), and blood lipid levels than the sleeve gastrectomy group. No serious complications occurred in either group. Participants randomized to gastric bypass were more likely to achieve remission of T2DM. Duodenum exclusion plays a role in T2DM treatment and should be assessed.

1641,Gastro-gastric fistulas and marginal ulcers in gastric bypass procedures for weight reduction.,"Gastro-gastric fistulas and marginal ulcers are frequent and serious complications of gastric compartmentalization procedures for obesity. The authors analyzed 810 patients after 911 operations for gastro-gastric fistulas and marginal ulcers over an 8-year period. All patients underwent a form of gastric bypass, in which a pouch is constructed along the lesser curvature of the stomach. The outlet of the pouch was restricted with a prosthetic band. In the first 189 patients (Group I), the pouch and stomach were stapled in continuity or partially divided. In the next 222 patients (Group II), segments were stapled and separated by transection. In the remaining 492 cases (Group III), in addition to transection of the stomach, a limb of jejunum was interposed between the pouch and excluded stomach. Stapled anastomoses were done in Group I and II patients and a portion of Group III patients. The remaining patients underwent hand-sewn anastomosis. Gastro-gastric fistulas occurred in 49% of the patients in Group I, 2.6% of those in Group II, and 0% of those in Group III. In stapled anastomosis, the incidence of marginal ulceration in Groups I, II, and III were 8.5%, 5.4%, and 5.1%, respectively. In a subset of Group III patients, in whom a two-layer, hand-sewn anastomosis was done, the incidence was 1.6% when the outer layer was not absorbable and 0% when both layers were absorbable. Gastro-gastric fistulas and marginal ulcerations are likely the result of breakdown of the mucosa resulting from migrating staples and other foreign material. Lack of integrity of the gastric lining facilitates the action of the gastric digestive process. Transection of gastric segments with interposition of jejunum prevents gastro-gastric fistula formation. An intact serosa appears to block the digestion of bowel wall by gastric enzymes. Our early data suggest that the use of absorbable sutures at the gastrojejunostomy significantly decreases the incidence of marginal ulceration.",10.1381/096089299765553674,,,,366
1089,Comparison of the effects of Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy and LRYGB with small stomach pouch on type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with BMI<35 kg/m(2).,"Based on distinct epidemiologic features of Chinese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, who tend to have abdominal fat deposition, but with normal or mildly overweight epidemiologic features, our center initially had treated T2DM with body mass index (BMI)<35 kg/mÂ² by performing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy since 2008. This procedure is successful in treating abnormal glucose metabolism but not in improving abdominal visceral obesity. However, since 2011, laparoscopic Roux-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) with a small stomach pouch has been performed at our center, with prominent resolution of abdominal visceral obesity and lower incidences of postoperative complications. The purpose of the present study was to formally compare these different procedures. From 2011 to 2013, 60 patients who met the NIH criteria were recruited and randomly assigned to undergo either laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy (n = 30) or LRYGB with a small stomach pouch (n = 30).Â All of the patients were followed for 12 months, and pre- and postoperative changes in BMI, waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), homoeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR), the body fat rate and major complications were recorded. Both procedures were successful in reducing HbA1c, FPG, and PBG levels and HOMA-IR scores. However, LRYGB with a small stomach pouch resulted in a greater reduction in FPG, PBG, and HbA1c levels, and HOMA-IR scores compared with Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy. In addition, the reductions in BMI, body fat content, waist circumference, and the incidence of postoperative marginal ulcers in the small-stomach-pouch LRYGB were significant. Both procedures are effective treatments for T2DM patients with BMI<35 kg/mÂ². However, the advantages of resolved abnormal glucose metabolism and abdominal visceral obesity and decreased incidences of surgical complications are more obvious for LRYGB with a small gastric pouch. Potentially, LRYGB with a small gastric pouch is more suitable for Chinese diabetic patients with BMI <35 kg/mÂ².",10.1016/j.soard.2014.12.029,,,,367
1516,Use of bioabsorbable staple reinforcement material in gastric bypass: a prospective randomized clinical trial.,"Staple line failure, although uncommon, can result in significant morbidity and, even, mortality. Staple line buttressing has been developed to improve staple line strength, decrease bleeding, and minimize the risk of leak. Many different products are currently available. However, most have not been proved in clinical trials for their clinical relevance. From April 2004 to March 2005, 48 morbidly obese patients who had undergone laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were enrolled in this study. The patients were randomly allocated to 2 groups according to whether polyglycolide acid and trimethylene carbonate (Seamguard) was (group 1, n = 24) or was not (group 2, n = 24) used in an investigator-initiated study. All patients underwent barium radiography at 3 and 12 months postoperatively. Peri- and postoperative mortality were absent. The intraoperative methylene blue test was positive in 1 patient in group 2. No conversion to laparotomy was needed. No patient required reoperation or transfusion for extraluminal bleeding, and no anastomotic leaks were detected in either group postoperatively. The mean number of clip instruments used was significantly lower in group 1 patients (2 versus 22, P <.0001, odds ratio 121.0, 95% confidence interval 12.5-1491). The operative time was significantly less in group 1 (115 +/- 30.0 min, range 85-210) compared with that in group 2 (150 +/- 51.7 min, range 90-240; P <.05). The postoperative hemoglobin level was significantly greater in group 1 (12.47 +/- 1.7 mg/dL, range 9.2-14.8) compared with that in group 2 (11.1 +/- 1.9 mg/dL, range 8.1-14.6; P <.05). Gastrogastric fistula formation was detected in 3 patients (12.5%) in group 2, with no statistically significant difference (P = .2). The results of our study have shown that synthetic reinforcement material minimizes staple line bleeding and reduces the operative time, with no animal source contamination. No adverse events related to the resorbable buttressing material were observed.",10.1016/j.soard.2007.03.244,,,,368
682,Efficacy of Intraperitoneal Instillation of Bupivacaine after Bariatric Surgery: Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Obesity is one of the greatest health problems. Bariatric surgery is more effective than non-surgical options; however, postoperative pain is bound to a greater morbidity. Control of postoperative pain is important in facilitating patient convalescence. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of intraperitoneal instillation of bupivacaine after bariatric surgery. A hundred patients who underwent bariatric procedures including sleeve gastrectomy, sleeve gastrectomy with cardioplasty, gastric bypass, and gastric mini bypass (one anastomosis gastric bypass) were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups randomly, 50 patients for each; group I had intraperitoneal instillation of 40Â ml bupivacaine 0.25% at the end of the procedure, while group II had normal saline instillation. Monitoring of pain control in the first 24Â h after surgery was done using the visual analogue scale (VAS) to assess the efficacy of intraperitoneal bupivacaine instillation and its effect on the overall opioid usage, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and shoulder tip pain. Pain scores were significantly lower in group I compared to group II at recovery, 2, 4 and 6Â h after surgery, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.004, 0.001, <â€‰0.001, and 0.001 respectively. However, there were no significant differences between 12 and 24Â h postoperatively. Additionally, there was a significant difference regarding the need for rescue analgesia at recovery Pâ€‰=â€‰<â€‰0.001*. Further analysis revealed lower morphine consumption via PCA in group I compared to group II Pâ€‰=â€‰0.013*. There were no significant differences with the use of intraperitoneal bupivacaine as regards nausea, vomiting, or shoulder tip pain, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.688, 0.249, and 0.487, respectively. Intraperitoneal instillation of bupivacaine provides a good analgesia in the early postoperative period, reduces the overall consumption of opioid, and decreases the rescue analgesia requirement in the first 24Â h after surgery.",10.1007/s11695-019-03775-x,,,,369
836,Effects of Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Comparison of BMI >Â 30 and <Â 30Â kg/m2.,"Recently, many studies focused on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with body mass index (BMI) <Â 30Â kg/m2 and suggested that those patients might benefit from Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). However, evidence on its effectiveness to improve T2DM patients with BMI <Â 30Â kg/m2 is still lacking. The aim of this study is to explore whether T2DM patients with BMI <Â 30Â kg/m2 get similar surgical effect from RYGB compared with those patients with BMI >Â 30Â kg/m2. Seventy patients with uncontrolled T2DM underwent laparoscopic RYGB from May 2010 to December 2015 in the GI Department of Daping Hospital. Weight, BMI, waist circumference, glucose, and lipid metabolic parameters were collected and evaluated at baseline and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24Â months postsurgery. Patients with BMI <Â 30Â kg/m2 were compared with those with BMI >Â 30Â kg/m2. Among the 70 patients, 47 (67.1%) BMI <Â 30Â kg/m2, and 23 (32.9%) BMI >Â 30Â kg/m2. Patients with BMI <Â 30Â kg/m2 are significantly older; they are female predominant and have longer duration of diabetes. The complete remission of T2DM was 28.2% of the BMI <Â 30Â kg/m2 group and 57.9% of the BMI >Â 30Â kg/m2 group (pÂ =Â 0.029). There was no significant difference in the change of glucose and lipid metabolic parameters of both groups. FPG, 2hPG, and HbA1c% levels were significantly improved after 1Â month (pÂ <Â 0.05), and then remained essentially stable from the sixth month in both groups. The 2-year study has shown that RYGB is a safe and effective procedure in treating T2DM with BMI <Â 30Â kg/m2, although the complete remission of T2DM in the BMI <Â 30Â kg/m2 group is lower than the BMI >Â 30Â kg/m2 group.",10.1007/s11695-017-2926-9,,,,370
1482,Review of meta-analytic comparisons of bariatric surgery with a focus on laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding.,"In a prior systematic review and meta-analysis of the large body of literature describing the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB), outcomes for the Swedish Adjustable Gastric Band (SAGB) and Lap-Band (LB), in particular, were reviewed. This article summarizes those results and discusses them in relation to the 3 other published bariatric surgery meta-analyses (JAMA 2004;292:1724-37; Ann Intern Med 2005;142:547-59; and Surgery 2007;142:621-32). In the gastric banding meta-analysis, systematic review included screening of 4,594 studies published in any language (Jan 1, 1998-April 30, 2006). Studies with at least 10 SAGB or LB patients reporting > or =30-day efficacy or safety outcomes were eligible for review; data were extracted from accepted studies. Weighted means analysis and random-effects meta-analysis of efficacy outcomes of interest were conducted. In the gastric banding meta-analysis, 129 studies (patients n = 28,980) were accepted (33 SAGB/104 LB studies). In 4,273 patients (36 treatment groups) in 33 SAGB studies, and in 24,707 patients (111 groups) in 104 LB studies, mean baseline age (39.1-40.2 yrs), body mass index ([BMI] 43.8-45.3 kg/m2), and sex (females 79.2%-82.5%) were similar. Three-year mean SAGB/LB excess weight loss (56.36%/50.20%) was significant, as was resolution of type 2 diabetes (61.45%/60.29%) and hypertension (62.95%/43.58%) (P < .05). Adverse event (AE) rates appeared comparable, and early mortality was equivalent (< or =.1%). In the SAGB and LB meta-analysis at 1, 2, and 3 years, weight loss, resolution of diabetes and hypertension, and adverse events appeared equivalent. All meta-analyses that assessed weight loss found that bariatric surgery produced clinically significant reductions in excess weight across procedures in the short term. One meta-analysis found that bariatric surgery produced significantly more weight loss than medical treatment in patients with BMI >40 kg/m2 in the short term, with malabsorptive procedures producing the greatest weight loss. All studies reporting on comorbidities showed significant resolution or improvement of type 2 diabetes mellitus ([T2DM] > or =60%), hypertension (> or =43%), and dyslipidemia (> or =70%). In one meta-analysis, surgery was found to be superior to medical therapy in resolving T2DM, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Sleep apnea was significantly resolved/improved in > or =85% across procedures in the one meta-analysis that addressed this comorbidity. One meta-analysis found no differences in AEs between procedures; however, the laparoscopic approach was associated with significantly reduced AEs. In the 4 meta-analyses, mortality was low (.1%-1.11%) for all procedures. Bariatric surgery was observed to be a safe and highly effective therapy for morbid obesity. Heterogeneity in nomenclature, study methods, statistical detail, definitions of weight-loss success and comorbid disease resolution, and completeness of data sets did not allow for comparison of some variables. Initiatives including the Iowa Bariatric Surgery Registry (IBSR), the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) consortium, the Surgical Review Corporation (SRC) Center of Excellence initiative, and the Bariatric Outcomes Longitudinal Database [BOLD] are working to improve data standardization, which, in turn, will facilitate summary and comparison of bariatric surgery outcomes.",10.1016/j.soard.2008.04.007,,,,371
830,Laparoscopic Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass in Elderly Patients (60 Years or Older): A Meta-Analysis of Comparative Studies.,"Elderly patient might experience an increased risk of complications after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis of comparative studies on this issue in patients aged 60â€‰years or older. A systematic literature search was performed. Medline, Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched until July 2016 for studies on outcomes of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in elderly versus younger patients. Primary outcomes were mortality and overall complications. Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay, excess weight loss percentage, effect on diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and obstructive sleep apnea. Heterogeneity across the studies was evaluated by the I2 test, and a random effects model was used. Results were expressed as mean difference and risk ratio (RR). Seven studies involving 3128 patients were retrieved and included in this study. A significantly increased risk of mortality and overall complications was observed among patients older than 60â€‰years compared with younger ones (RR, 6.12; 95% confidence interval 1.08-34.83; pâ€‰=â€‰0.04; RR, 1.51; 95% confidence interval 1.07-2.11; pâ€‰=â€‰0.02). Particularly, elderly patients experienced 1% increased risk of mortality and 3% increased risk of overall complications. Length of stay, diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea remission rates were similar among the groups. Excess weight loss percentage was significantly greater among younger patients (mean difference, -3.44; 95% confidence interval -5.20, -1.68; pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), as were hypertension (RR, 0.57; 95% confidence interval 0.42-0.76; pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and hyperlipidemia (RR, 0.61; 95% confidence interval 0.45-0.83; pâ€‰=â€‰0.002) remission rates. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in patients older than 60â€‰years may be a risky bariatric surgery operation due to higher complications and mortality and may not be as effective as in patients younger than 60â€‰years. Thus, older patients should be carefully counseled before this procedure for individual risk-benefit assessment.",10.1177/1457496917731183,,,,372
455,Assessment of body composition in obese patients undergoing one anastomosis gastric bypass: cross-sectional study.,"Bariatric surgery is the most effective long-term treatment to obesity, and it is necessary to assess changes in body composition and to be able to establish better follow-up of patients. Cross-sectional, observational study in patients undergoing One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB) bariatric surgery. We analysed changes in weight and body composition during the first postoperative year. 405 patients (68.9% women. 31.1% men), mean age 44Â years, mean weight 110.02Â kg, Body Mass Index (BMI) 39.76Â kg/m2, height 1.66Â m. The variables analyzed were substantially decreased compared to the preoperative values one year after surgery in every case: weight (110.02â€‰Â±â€‰22.03Â kg vs. 69.36â€‰Â±â€‰13.60Â kg), BMI (39.76â€‰Â±â€‰6.65 vs. 24.52â€‰Â±â€‰3. 76), fat free mass (61.12â€‰Â±â€‰12.43Â kg vs. 53.61â€‰Â±â€‰11.61Â kg), fat mass (50.44â€‰Â±â€‰14.36Â kg vs. 15.74â€‰Â±â€‰6.74Â kg), bone mass (58.06â€‰Â±â€‰11.85Â kg vs. 50.92â€‰Â±â€‰11.06Â kg) and water (45.08â€‰Â±â€‰9.99Â kg vs. 37.39â€‰Â±â€‰9.23Â kg), P < 0.001. The results show noticeable improvements in weight reduction and changes in body composition, and will contribute to develop a thorough understanding of both of them, contributing also to perform a better patients' follow-up.",10.1038/s41598-020-75589-2,,,,373
1360,[Antecolic versus retrocolic gastroenteric anastomosis for laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a prospective randomized control trial].,"To compare short-term postoperative outcomes between antecolic and retrocolic laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass(LRYGB). Forty obesity patients were admitted into The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University from March 2008 to July 2010. All patients were randomly assigned to undergo antecolic (group A, 20 cases) and retrocolic (group B, 20 cases) gastroenteric anastomosis. Short-term outcomes were compared. LRYGB procedures were successfully performed in all the 40 patients. There were no significant differences between the two groups in estimated blood loss during surgery, time to flatus passage, time to resumption of oral intake, or length of postoperative hospital stay. The operation time was longer in group B than that in group A [(163.4Â±28.1) min vs.(131.8Â±22.7) min, P<0.05]. There were no patients developed internal hernia or anastomotic leakage in either group. Comparison of short-term gastrointestinal symptoms after surgery showed no statistical significance. Although retrocolic procedure may be closer to anatomical structure, antecolic and retrocolic anastomosis have comparable short-term outcomes after surgery. Further study is warranted to investigate long-term outcomes.",,,,,374
617,"Long-term adverse events after sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass: a 7-year nationwide, observational, population-based, cohort study.","Concerns are rising about the late adverse events following gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. We aimed to assess, over a 7-year period, the late adverse events after gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy compared with matched control groups. In this nationwide, observational, population-based, cohort study, we used data extracted from the French National Health Insurance (SystÃ¨me National des DonnÃ©es de SantÃ©) database. All patients undergoing gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy in France in 2009, except those who had undergone bariatric surgery in the previous 4 years before inclusion, were matched with control patients with obesity in terms of age, sex, BMI category, baseline antidiabetic therapy, and baseline insulin therapy. Exclusion criteria for the control group included cancer, pregnancy, chronic infectious disease, serious acute or chronic disease in 2008-09, or previous (2005-09) or forthcoming (2010-11) bariatric surgery. The incidence rate was calculated for each type of adverse event leading to inpatient hospital admission over a 7-year period; incidence rate ratios (with 95% CIs) were computed to compare the rate of complications among the bariatric surgery and control groups. Risks of complications during follow-up were compared using Cox proportional-hazards regression analyses. Data were analysed according to the intention-to-treat methodology. From Jan 1, 2009, to Dec 31, 2009, 8966 patients who underwent bariatric surgery (7359 [82%] women; mean age 40Â·4 years [SD 11Â·3]) and 8966 matched controls (7359 [82%] women; mean age 40Â·9 years [11Â·4]) were included in analyses 4955 (55%) off 8966 patients in the bariatric surgery group had a primary gastric bypass and 4011 (45%) patients had sleeve gastrectomy. With a mean follow-up of 6Â·8 years (SD 0Â·2), mortality was lower in the gastric bypass group than in its control group (hazard ratio 0Â·64 [95% CI 0Â·52-0Â·78]; p<0Â·0001) and in the sleeve gastrectomy group than in its control group (0Â·38 [0Â·29-0Â·50]; p<0Â·0001). The gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy groups had higher risk than did their control groups for invasive gastrointestinal surgery or endoscopy (incidence rate ratio 2Â·4 [95% CI 2Â·1-2Â·7], p<0Â·0001, for gastric bypass vs control and 1Â·5 [1Â·3-1Â·7], p<0Â·0001, for sleeve gastrectomy vs control); for gastrointestinal disorders not leading to invasive procedures (1Â·9 [1Â·7-2Â·1]), p<0Â·0001, for gastric bypass vs control and 1Â·2 [1Â·1-1Â·4], p<0Â·0001, for sleeve gastrectomy vs control); and for nutritional disorders (4Â·9 [3Â·8-6Â·4], p<0Â·0001, for gastric bypass vs control and 1Â·8 [1Â·3-2Â·5], p<0Â·0001, for sleeve gastrectomy vs control). For psychiatric disorders, there was no significant association (1Â·1 [0Â·9-1Â·4], p=0Â·190, for gastric bypass vs control and 1Â·1 [0Â·8-1Â·3], p=0Â·645, for sleeve gastrectomy vs control), except for gastric bypass and alcohol dependence (1Â·8 [1Â·1-2Â·8], p=0Â·0124). Despite lower 7-year mortality, patients undergoing gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy had higher risk of hospital admission at least once for late adverse events, except for psychiatric disorders, than did control patients, with a higher risk observed after gastric bypass than with sleeve gastrectomy.

1083,Preserved Insulin Secretory Capacity and Weight Loss Are the Predominant Predictors of Glycemic Control in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Randomized to Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.,"Improvement in type 2 diabetes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has been attributed partly to weight loss, but mechanisms beyond weight loss remain unclear. We performed an ancillary study to the Diabetes Surgery Study to assess changes in incretins, insulin sensitivity, and secretion 1 year after randomization to lifestyle modification and intensive medical management (LS/IMM) alone (n = 34) or in conjunction with RYGB (n = 34). The RYGB group lost more weight and had greater improvement in HbA1c. Fasting glucose was lower after RYGB than after LS/IMM, although the glucose area under the curve decreased comparably for both groups. Insulin sensitivity increased in both groups. Insulin secretion was unchanged after LS/IMM but decreased after RYGB, except for a rapid increase during the first 30 min after meal ingestion. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) was substantially increased after RYGB, while gastric inhibitory polypeptide and glucagon decreased. Lower HbA1c was most strongly correlated with the percentage of weight loss for both groups. At baseline, a greater C-peptide index and 90-min postprandial C-peptide level were predictive of lower HbA1c at 1 year after RYGB. Î²-Cell glucose sensitivity, which improved only after RYGB, and improved disposition index were associated with lower HbA1c in both groups, independent of weight loss. Weight loss and preserved Î²-cell function both predominantly determine the greatest glycemic benefit after RYGB.",10.2337/db14-1870,,,,376
1554,Early U.S. outcomes of laparoscopic gastric bypass versus laparoscopic adjustable silicone gastric banding for morbid obesity.,"Laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGBP) is the gold standard operation for long-term weight control in the United States. Laparoscopic adjustable silicone gastric banding (LASGB) is the preferred operative method for morbid obesity worldwide. Limited data are available comparing the two procedure in the United States. This study compares weight loss, complications, and early outcome of comorbidity resolution in patients who underwent LGBP versus LASGB. A review of prospectively collected data was performed on 392 patients undergoing primary LGBP (n = 232) and LASGB (n = 160) procedures between February 2001 and July 2004. Differences in percentage excess weight lost (%EWL) at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postop, improvement or resolution of comorbidities, and complications across procedure types were evaluated. Mean initial body mass index between groups was not significantly different (LGBP 47.2 vs LASGB 47.1, p < 0.53). There were significant differences in age, gender, and self-reported sweet-eating behavior between operative groups. There was a significantly greater %EWL in patients who underwent LGBP compared to patients of the LASGB groups 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after surgery. There were no significant differences in resolution or improvement of comorbidities between the groups. Although LGBP patients experienced more complications compared to LASGB patients (5.6 vs 4.3%, respectively; p < 0.56), this did not reach statistical significance. Early after surgery, LGBP patients lose more weight than LASGB patients but have similar improvements in comorbidities. Further follow-up is needed to determine the relative long-term efficacy of these procedures.",10.1007/s00464-005-0243-1,,,,377
266,Systematic review: Outcomes of bariatric surgery in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and de-novo IBD development after bariatric surgery.,"A large proportion of patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease are obese. Outcomes of bariatric surgery in patients with IBD and on IBD disease course itself is not clear. Furthermore, there is some evidence that bariatric surgery can precipitate the development of de-novo IBD. Thus, the aim of this systematic review was to summarise the evidence from the literature surrounding these questions.Â A comprehensive literature review was conducted based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines (PRISMA). PUBMED, and MEDLINE databases was searched using a combination of keywords and MeSH terms including ""gastric bypass"", ""sleeve gastrectomy"", ""Roux-en-Y"", ""Duodenal switch"", ""RYGB"", ""bariatric surgery"" and ""inflammatory bowel disease"", ""Crohn's disease"" ,""Ulcerative colitis"". Studies published up to March 2020 were included in this analysis. 22 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies revealed that bariatric surgery is safe and effective for patients with IBD and resulted in significant weight loss at both the 6-month and 12-month time points. Furthermore, multiple studies reported de-novo IBD development following bariatric surgery in a selection of patients.",10.1016/j.surge.2022.04.008,,,,378
580,A systematic review of the effect of gastric pouch and/or gastrojejunostomy (stoma) size on weight loss outcomes with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"The effect of the gastric pouch or Gastrojejunostomy (GJ or stoma) size on weight loss outcomes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is unclear with studies reporting conflicting results. The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the impact of the gastric pouch or stoma size on weight loss outcomes with RYGB. An online search of PubMed was carried out to identify all articles evaluating the effect of the gastric pouch and/or gastric stoma size at the time of surgery on outcomes associated with RYGB. Quality and heterogeneity of data precluded a meta-analysis. So a systematic review was performed without a meta-analysis. This review found a total of 14 studies (two of which were randomised) evaluating the effect of pouch sizes on weight loss outcomes after RYGB. Nine of these studies did not find any significant association between pouch size and weight loss outcomes whereas five studies found larger pouches to be associated with poorer weight loss outcomes. No study found larger pouches to be associated with better weight loss outcomes. Out of the ten studies (one of which was randomised) that evaluated the effect of stoma size on weight loss outcomes after RYGB, six studies did not show any significant effect of stoma size on weight loss outcomes and four found larger stoma sizes to be associated with significantly poorer weight loss outcomes. No study found larger stoma to be associated with better weight loss outcomes. This review finds that a larger pouch or stoma size may be associated with adverse weight loss outcomes but the quality of data does not allow us to precisely determine optimum pouch or stoma size with RYGB. There is a need for more randomised data comparing long-term weight loss outcomes with pouches or stoma of different sizes.",10.1007/s00464-019-07277-w,,,,379
1283,Long-term results of a randomized trial comparing banded versus standard laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Banded Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was designed to avoid or diminish weight regain in the long term. In 2008, we published the initial results of a pilot study design to comparatively evaluate surgical morbidity, mortality, and maximum weight loss in patients undergoing banded and unbanded laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). The present study analyzes the 5-year results. A randomized, controlled trial was carried out in 60 morbidly obese patients who underwent LRYGB. Patients were divided in 2 groups. Half of the patients underwent the banded version of the LRYGB, and half underwent the unbanded version. The 5-year excess weight loss (EWL) and loss of body mass index (BMI) were comparatively analyzed. There were 58 females and 2 males with a mean preoperative BMI of 47Â±4.9 kg/m(2). A total of 21 patients with banded LRYGB and 22 with unbanded LRYGB completed 5-year follow-up. One patient died 3 years after surgery from metastatic melanoma. EWL at 5 years was 61.6%Â±19.6% versus 59.8%Â±15.9% (P = ns), and loss of BMI was 32.9%Â±5.2% versus 32.8%Â±4.3% (P = ns), respectively, for the banded and unbanded group. In this small study, there were no statistical differences in the EWL and the BMI lost at 5 years between the group of patients who underwent banded and unbanded LRYGB.",10.1016/j.soard.2012.09.009,,,,380
1326,Excessive weight loss after sleeve gastrectomy: a systematic review.,"The clinical significance of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) as a primary bariatric intervention is still under debate. This article aims to systematically analyze excessive weight loss (EWL) in patients after SG. A systematic literature search on SG from the period January 2003 to December 2010 was performed. Data described from systematic reviews dealing with gastric bypass procedures was used as comparator. The final study included 123 papers describing 12,129 patients. Most of the papers describe EWL at 12 months (43.9% of all papers). For SG, the maximum EWL occurred 24 and 36 months postoperatively with a mean EWL of 64.3% (minimum 46.1%, maximum 75.0%) and 66.0% (minimum 60.0%, maximum 77.5%), respectively. At 12 months, the mean EWL in patients receiving SG was significantly lower when compared to patients who underwent gastric bypass (SG 56.1%, gastric bypass 68.3%; p < 0.01, two-sided Wilcoxon test). Although patients with gastric bypass still had higher EWL rates at 24 months compared to patients after SG, these differences were not significant (SG 61.3%, gastric bypass 69.6%; p = 0.09, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Reoperations after SG are necessary in 6.8% (range 0.7-25%) of cases with patients receiving SG as a stand alone procedure and in 9.6-28.5% of cases with patients undergoing SG as a planned first stage procedure. SG is an effective bariatric procedure with a lasting effect on EWL. Compared with gastric bypasses, there is no difference in EWL at the time point of 24 months.",10.1007/s11695-012-0616-1,,,,381
1468,The effect of stoma size on weight loss after laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery: results of a blinded randomized controlled trial.,"To determine the effect of different stoma sizes on the percent excess weight loss (%EWL) following laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (LRYGBP). Blinded randomized prospective controlled study in two American Society for Bariatric Surgeons-designated Centers of Excellence hospitals. Two hundred gastric bypass patients between January 2005 and September 2005 were prospectively randomized into two groups of 100 patients each in the operating room, after the induction of anesthesia. Patients underwent LRYGBP with different stapler sizes of 21 and 25 mm for gastrojejunal (GJ) anastomosis from January 2005 to September 2005. Postoperative %EWL following LRYGBP in both patient groups were calculated using a multivariable linear mixed-effects model with an unstructured covariance matrix and a logistic regression was used to measure clinical comorbidities. Applying multivariable mixed models and logistical regression, circular stapler size of 21 and 25 mm, which predicted the need for dilations (odds ratio = 0.489), did not predict weight loss. The only predictors of weight loss were male gender and higher initial weight (p < 0.001). Follow-up at 2 years in the 21- and 25-mm groups was 68% and 66%, respectively. Both groups had > 80% EWL at 2 years. The level of restriction or the presence of stenosis achieved by different circular stapler sizes does not have a significant causative role in weight loss.",10.1007/s11695-008-9753-y,,,,382
1246,Roux-en-Y gastric bypass vs sleeve gastrectomy for obese patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomised trial.,"Bariatric surgery is gaining acceptance as a 'metabolic surgical intervention' for patients with type 2 diabetes. The optimal form of surgery and the mechanism of action of these procedures are much debated. We compared two bariatric procedures for obese patients with type 2 diabetes and evaluated their effects on HbA1c and glucose tolerance. We performed a parallel un-blinded randomised trial of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) vs sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in 41 obese patients with type 2 diabetes, who were bariatric surgery candidates attending the obesity clinic. HbA1c, body composition and glucose tolerance were evaluated at baseline, and at 3 and 12 months. Of the 41 patients, 37 completed the follow-up (19 RYGB, 18 SG). Both groups had similar baseline anthropometric and biochemical measures, and showed comparable weight loss and fat:fat-free mass ratio changes at 12 months. A similar normalisation of HbA1c levels was observed as early as 3 months post-surgery (6.37 Â± 0.71% vs 6.23 Â± 0.69% for RYGB vs SG respectively, p < 0.001 in both groups for baseline vs follow-up).

1526,Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: 5-year results of a prospective randomized trial.,"To perform a prospective, randomized comparison of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). LAGB, using the pars flaccida technique, and standard LRYGB were performed. From January 2000 to November 2000, 51 patients (mean age 34.0 +/- 8.9 years, range 20-49) were randomly allocated to undergo either LAGB (n = 27, 5 men and 22 women, mean age 33.3 years, mean weight 120 kg, mean body mass index [BMI] 43.4 kg/m(2); percentage of excess weight loss 83.8%) or LRYGB (n = 24, 4 men and 20 women, mean age 34.7, mean weight 120 kg, mean BMI 43.8 kg/m(2), percentage of excess weight loss 83.3). Data on the operative time, complications, reoperations with hospital stay, weight, BMI, percentage of excess weight loss, and co-morbidities were collected yearly. Failure was considered a BMI of >35 at 5 years postoperatively. The data were analyzed using Student's t test and Fisher's exact test, with P <.05 considered significant. The mean operative time was 60 +/- 20 minutes for the LAGB group and 220 +/- 100 minutes for the LRYGB group (P <.001). One patient in the LAGB group was lost to follow-up. No patient died. Conversion to laparotomy was performed in 1 (4.2%) of 24 LRYGB patients because of a posterior leak of the gastrojejunal anastomosis. Reoperations were required in 4 (15.2%) of 26 LAGB patients, 2 because of gastric pouch dilation and 2 because of unsatisfactory weight loss. One of these patients required conversion to biliopancreatic diversion; the remaining 3 patients were on the waiting list for LRYGB. Reoperations were required in 3 (12.5%) of the 24 LRYGB patients, and each was because of a potentially lethal complication. No LAGB patient required reoperation because of an early complication. Of the 27 LAGB patients, 3 had hypertension and 1 had sleep apnea. Of the 24 LRYGB patients, 2 had hyperlipemia, 1 had hypertension, and 1 had type 2 diabetes. Five years after surgery, the diabetes, sleep apnea, and hyperlipemia had resolved. At the 5-year (range 60-66 months) follow-up visit, the LRYGB patients had significantly lower weight and BMI and a greater percentage of excess weight loss than did the LAGB patients. Weight loss failure (BMI >35 kg/m(2) at 5 yr) was observed in 9 (34.6%) of 26 LAGB patients and in 1 (4.2%) of 24 LRYGB patients (P <.001). Of the 26 patients in the LAGB group and 24 in the LRYGB group, 3 (11.5%) and 15 (62.5%) had a BMI of <30 kg/m(2), respectively (P <.001). The results of our study have shown that LRYGB results in better weight loss and a reduced number of failures compared with LAGB, despite the significantly longer operative time and life-threatening complications.",10.1016/j.soard.2006.12.005,,,,384
968,Sleeve gastrectomy versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for type 2 diabetes and morbid obesity: double-blind randomised clinical trial protocol.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) in association with obesity is an increasing disease burden. Bariatric surgery is the only effective therapy for achieving remission of T2D among those with morbid obesity. It is unclear which of the two most commonly performed types of bariatric surgery, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), is most effective for obese patients with T2D. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether LSG or LRYGB is more effective in achieving HbA1c<6% (<42â€…mmol/mol) without the use of diabetes medication at 5â€…years. Single-centre, double-blind (assessor and patient), parallel, randomised clinical trial (RCT) conducted in New Zealand, targeting 106 patients. Eligibility criteria include age 20-55â€…years, T2D of at least 6â€…months duration and body mass index 35-65â€…kg/m(2) for at least 5â€…years. Randomisation 1:1 to LSG or LRYGB, used random number codes disclosed to the operating surgeon after induction of anaesthesia. A standard medication adjustment schedule will be used during postoperative metabolic assessments. Secondary outcomes include proportions achieving HbA1c<5.7% (39â€…mmol/mol) or HbA1c<6.5% (48â€…mmol/mol) without the use of diabetes medication, comparative weight loss, obesity-related comorbidity, operative complications, revision rate, mortality, quality of life, anxiety and depression scores. Exploratory outcomes include changes in satiety, gut hormone and gut microbiota to gain underlying mechanistic insights into T2D remission. Ethics approval was obtained from the New Zealand regional ethics committee (NZ93405) who also provided independent safety monitoring of the trial. Study commenced in September 2011. Recruitment completed in October 2014. Data collection is ongoing. Results will be reported in manuscripts submitted to peer-reviewed journals and in presentations at national and international meetings.

155,Evolution of the basal metabolic rate after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Patients who undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) exhibit a reduction in total basal metabolic rate (BMR) after surgery, which seems to be intimately related to the amount of postoperative weight loss. The objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to determine and evaluate BMR changes after RYGB. The search was performed in certified databases, and the strategy was structured according to the PRISMA ScR. The quality evaluation of the articles included in this review was assessed with two different bias risk tools (ROBINS-I and NIH) according to each study design. Two meta-analyses were elaborated based on the results. 163 articles were selected (from 2016 to 2020), and 9 articles met the inclusion criteria. All of the selected studies evaluated only adult patients, mostly women. Postoperative BMR diminished in all of the included studies after surgery compared to preoperative values. The follow-up periods were 6, 12, 24 and 36Â months. Eight articles were used for the meta-analysis after the quality assessment, a total of 434 participants. Compared to baseline values, mean postoperative reductions of 356.66Â kcal/d after 6Â months (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and 432.89Â kcal/d (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) after 1Â year were observed. The BMR decreases during the first years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, especially during the first year postsurgery.",10.1007/s13304-023-01523-6,,,,386
1536,Efficacy of estradiol topical patch in the treatment of symptoms of depression following mini-gastric bypass in women.,"Obesity is associated with elevated levels of estrogen. Gastric bypass causes rapid weight loss and decreased levels of estrogen. Patients after gastric bypass can suffer from anxiety and depression out of proportion to the surgical outcome. This study reports the efficacy of a short-term empiric trial of topical estradiol for the treatment of mild to moderate depression and anxiety following mini-gastric bypass (MGB) in women. Postoperative MGB women were surveyed for the presence of depressive symptoms before and after MGB. The results of an empiric trial of transdermal patches of estradiol-17beta were assessed. Outcome measures were the self-reported efficacy of the patch. 711 women who had undergone MGB and had functioning e-mail addresses made up the study. 62% of patients reported depression prior to surgery. 156 patients (22%) reported depression after the operation. 130 women were treated empirically with the patch, and remission of depression was observed in 92 (71%). In response to the question ""Did the estrogen patch help?"", subjects reported responses of 1) Yes, fantastic, 2) Yes, somewhat, 3) Hard to say, 4) No, in 36%, 31%, 20%, 13% of respondents respectively. Patients treated with estradiol sustained antidepressant benefit of treatment after the patch was discontinued. Treatment lasted <1 month, 1-3 months, and >3 months, in 48%, 32% and 20% respectively. Treatment was well-tolerated and adverse events were rare. Depression is common in obese patients and remains a problem in a subset following the MGB operation. Transdermal estradiol replacement appears to be an effective treatment of symptoms of depression in women following MGB.",10.1381/096089206778392347,,,,387
405,Barbed suture in gastro-intestinal surgery: A review with a meta-analysis.,"The laparoscopic approach is a very popular technique for many gastrointestinal operations and barbed sutures may improve the difficulties of intracorporeal anastomosis by eliminating the need for knot tying. The aim of this systematic review with a meta-analysis is to explore literature to establish the security profile of barbed suture compared with conventional laparoscopic sutures. A systematic search was performed in all electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE) and 12 studies were included in the analysis, involving 27,133 patients, whereof 3372 cases (patients undergone barbed suture usage) and 23,761 controls (patients undergone conventional suture usage). We found 3 studies discussing differences between barbed and conventional sutures in colorectal surgery and 8 studies presenting results in bariatric surgery, both in Roux-en-y gastric bypass and Mini Gastric/One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass. We found comparable rate of leaks, bleedings and stenosis. The meta-regression analysis demonstrated that, both in case of bariatric and colorectal surgery, the demographic characteristic of patients and the oncological features of neoplasms did not impact of these findings. As expected, operative time is significantly shorter when barbed suture is used. Our analysis on current literature define an acceptable security profile for barbed suture with effective results particularly in terms of shorter operative time.",10.1016/j.surge.2021.02.011,,,,388
335,Effect of intraperitoneal local anesthesia on enhanced recovery outcomes after bariatric surgery: a randomized controlled pilot study.,"Patients with extreme obesity are at high risk for adverse perioperative events, especially when opioid-centric analgesic protocols are used, and perioperative pain management interventions in bariatric surgery could improve safety, outcomes and satisfaction. We aimed to evaluate the impact of intraperitoneal local anesthesia (IPLA) on enhanced recovery after bariatric surgery (ERABS) outcomes. We conducted a prospective double-blind randomized controlled pilot study in adherence to an a priori peer-reviewed protocol. Patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (LRYGB) with an established ERABS protocol between July 2014 and February 2015 were randomly allocated to receive either IPLA with 0.2% ropivacaine (intervention group) or normal saline (control group). We measured pain scores, analgesic consumption and adverse effects. Functional prehabilitation outcomes, including peak expiratory flow (PEF) and the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and Quality of Recovery Survey-40 (QoR-40) scores, were assessed before surgery, and 1 day and 7 days postoperatively. One hundred patients were randomly allocated to the study groups, of whom 92 completed the study, 46 in each group. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in baseline characteristics or any primary or secondary outcomes. Pain scores and analgesic consumption were low in both groups. There were no adverse events. Significant declines in PEF and 6MWT and QoR-40 scores were noted on postoperative day 1 in both groups; the values returned to baseline on postoperative day 7 in both groups. Intraperitoneal local anesthesia with ropivacaine did not reduce postoperative pain or analgesic consumption when administered intraoperatively to patients undergoing LRYGB. Standardization of the ERABS protocol benefited patients, with functional prehabilitation outcomes returning to baseline postoperatively. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov no.

472,Effect of Billroth-II versus Roux-en-Y reconstruction for gastrojejunostomy after pancreaticoduodenectomy on delayed gastric emptying: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) is one of the most common complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). The aim of the present meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of Billroth-II(B-II) versus Roux-en-Y (R-Y) reconstruction for gastrojejunostomy on DGE after PD. A systematic literature search was performed using the electronic database MEDLINE (via PubMed and OVID), EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) of the Cochrane Library to select pertinent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on this topic from January 1990 to January 2020. The primary outcome was identified as postoperative DGE. Subgroup analysis was established to compare the incidence of grade B and C DGE. Software Revman 5.3 was used for the statistical analysis, summary statistics were calculated using fixed effect model or random effect model. Five RCTs including a total of 612 patients were eligible for this meta-analysis. The incidence of grade B and C DGE was significantly lower with the B-II reconstruction than with the R-Y reconstruction (8.0% vs. 14.8%, ORÂ =Â 0.49, 95% CI: 0.26-0.95, PÂ =Â 0.03) and the B-II reconstruction took a shorter operation time (WMD=-7.18, 95% CI: [-13.09, -1.27], PÂ =Â 0,02). No statistically significant difference was found between the two reconstruction methods in terms of the incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), bile leak, intra-abdominal abscess, postoperative pneumonia and the length of postoperative hospital stay. B-II reconstruction after PD has a lower incidence of grade B and C DGE and shorter operation time compared with R-Y reconstruction.",10.1002/jhbp.828,,,,390
1215,Robotic versus laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in obese adults ages 18 to 65Â years: a systematic review and economic analysis.,"In the United States, 37.5Â % of adults (78 million) are obese. The direct medical costs of treating obesity-related disease account for more than 6Â % of the national health expenditure. Robotic bariatric surgery is becoming more common, but it is unclear whether robotic procedures result in lower complication rates. Additionally, some evidence is conflicting regarding the costs of robotic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) compared with those of laparoscopic RYGB. This study aimed to compare complication rates, operative characteristics, and expected costs between robotic and laparoscopic RYGB. A systematic review of the literature was performed with searches of five databases and grey literature, hand searches, and reference and forward citation searches. Studies comparing robotic versus laparoscopic RYGB involving patients ages 18-65Â years who met the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria for bariatric surgery were included in the study if they reported overall or major complication rates. Outcomes were pooled using random-effects metaanalysis. A decision-tree economic analysis was performed to calculate expected costs associated with each technique. The systematic search strategy returned 1,374 potentially relevant studies. The inclusion criteria were met by 10 of these studies, which included results from 2,557 patients. The overall major and minor complications did not differ significantly between the robotic and laparoscopic groups. The rates for anastomotic leak, bleeding, stricture, and reoperation did not differ significantly. An economic analysis found that the expected costs for robotic RYGB ($15,447) were higher than for laparoscopic RYGB ($11,956). Sensitivity analyses produced similar results. The complication rates did not differ significantly between robotic and laparoscopic RYGB, but the expected costs were greater for robotic RYGB. Further cost effectiveness analyses are recommended before adoption of a robotic approach to RYGB.",10.1007/s00464-013-3217-8,,,,391
312,Management of choledocholithiasis after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a systematic review and pooled proportion meta-analysis.,"Several therapeutic modalities have been proposed for the management of choledocholithiasis (CDL) following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), yet debate exists regarding the optimal management. The purpose of our study was to review the current literature to compare the efficacy of various techniques in the management of CDL post-RYGB. A comprehensive search of multiple databases was conducted. Studies reporting on the management of CDL in patients post-RYGB and including at least 5 patients were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was successful stone clearance. Secondary outcomes included procedure duration, length of hospital stay, and adverse events. Of 3259 identified studies, 53 studies involving 857 patients were included in the final analysis. The mean age was 54.4Â years (SD 7.05), 78.8% were female (SD 13.6%), and the average BMI was 30.8Â kg/m2 (SD 6.85). Procedures described included laparoscopy-assisted ERCP (LAERCP), balloon-assisted enteroscopy (BAE), ultrasound-directed transgastric ERCP (EDGE), laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE), EUS-guided intra-hepatic puncture with antegrade clearance (EGHAC), percutaneous trans-hepatic biliary drainage (PTHBD), and rendezvous guidewire-associated (RGA) ERCP. High rates of successful stone clearance were observed with LAERCP (1.00; 95% CI 0.99-1.00; pâ€‰=â€‰0.47), EDGE (0.97; 95% CI 0.9-1.00; pâ€‰=â€‰0.54), IGS ERCP (1.00; 95% CI 0.87-1.00), PTHBD (1.0; 95% CI 0.96-1.00), and LCBDE (0.99; 95% CI 0.93-1.00, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Lower rates of stone clearance were observed with BAE (61.5%; 95%CI 44.3-76.3, pâ€‰=â€‰0.188) and EGHAC (74.0%; 95% CI 42.9-91.5, pâ€‰=â€‰0.124). Relative to EDGE, LAERCP had a longer procedure duration (133.1 vs. 67.4Â min) but lower complication rates (12.8% vs. 24.3%). LAERCP and EDGE had high rates of success in the management of CDL post-RYGB. LAERCP had fewer complications but was associated with longer procedure times. BAE had lower success rates than both LAERCP and EDGE.",10.1007/s00464-022-09018-y,,,,392
564,Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Versus Sleeve Gastrectomy for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Nonseverely Obese Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Recently, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have indicated that bariatric surgery in nonseverely obese patients with a body mass index (BMI) less than 35Â kg/m2 might be even superior to medical therapy with regard to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remission, but the efficacy of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) compared with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in nonseverely obese patients has not been conclusively determined. The objective of this study is to compare LRYGB versus LSG for T2DM in nonseverely obese patients. A meta-analysis identifying RCTs evaluating LRYGB versus LSG for T2DM in nonseverely obese patients was conducted. The primary outcome was T2DM remission. Additional analyses comprised percent excess weight loss (%EWL), BMI, waist circumference, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), serum lipid level, medication use, quality of life, and adverse events. Four RCTs concerning total 296 patients were included. T2DM remission rate and %EWL were of no difference between the two bariatric procedures. LRYGB was associated with lower BMI, waist circumference, low-density lipoprotein, and higher high-density lipoprotein than LSG. However, HbA1c, FPG, total cholesterol, and triglyceride were not significantly different between the two surgical groups. The medication use and quality of life were improved in both two groups. The gastroesophageal reflux diseases of LRYGB group were less than that of LSG group. Dumping syndromes were noted more frequently in the LRYGB group. Both LRYGB and LSG have comparative effect on resolving T2DM in nonseverely obese patients at midterm follow-up. Further RCTs should address the potential risks and long-term effects of LRYGB and LSG in nonseverely obese patients.",10.1007/s11695-019-04378-2,,,,393
116,Comparison of Single Versus Double Anastomosis Bariatric Metabolic Surgery in Obesity: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Major BMS are modified through loop rather than Roux-en-Y type reconstruction recently, and this study systematically reviews the BMS from the perspective of SAÂ (single anastomosis) and DAÂ (double anastomosis) procedures, aiming to research the differences among bariatric procedures. A total of 39 studies compared SA- and DA-BMS were finally eligible for analysis after searching in PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Compared with DA, SA shortens operative time and decreases complications especially obstruction, internal hernia, and reoperation. SA-GBÂ (gastric bypass) has significantly higher %TWL and T2DM remission rate than DA-GB 1- and 5-year postoperatively. SA-DSÂ (duodenal switch) has similar 1-year %TWL and lower 5-year %TWL, and comparable 1- and 5-year T2DM remission with DA-DS. SA provides significant advantages about simplicity and safety. This, together with the shorter learning curve, makes SA a promising choice.",10.1007/s11695-023-06805-x,,,,394
827,Stapled anastomosis versus hand-sewn anastomosis of gastro/duodenojejunostomy in pancreaticoduodenectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Controversy exists regarding the best anastomotic method for pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). We aimed to evaluate the perioperative outcomes of PD with stapled anastomosis (SA) versus hand-sewn anastomosis (HA) of gastrojejunostomy or duodenojejunostomy. We conducted a systematic search of electronic information sources, including MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry; ClinicalTrials.gov; ISRCTN Register, and bibliographic reference lists. We applied a combination of free text and controlled vocabulary search adapted to thesaurus headings, search operators and limits in each of the above databases. Delayed gastric emptying (DGE), postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), anastomotic bleeding, anastomotic leak, intra-abdominal abscess and mortality were defined as the outcome parameters. Combined overall effect sizes were calculated using fixed-effect or random-effects models. We identified 1 randomised controlled trial (RCT) and 5 observational studies reporting a total of 890 patients who underwent PD with SA (nÂ =Â 300) or conventional HA (nÂ =Â 590). Our analysis demonstrated that SA significantly reduced postoperative DGE (OR: 0.37, 95% CI 0.25-0.54, PÂ <Â 0.00001) but significantly increased anastomotic bleeding (OR: 13.4, 95% CI 2.96-57.41, PÂ =Â 0.0007) compared to HA. No significant difference was found in POPF (OR: 0.83, 95% CI 0.56-1.21, PÂ =Â 0.33); anastomotic leak (OR: 0.50, 95% CI 0.09-3.79, PÂ =Â 0.58); intra-abdominal abscess (OR: 1.39, 95% CI 0.71-2.70, PÂ =Â 0.34); or mortality (RD: -0.01, 95% CI 0.03-0.02, PÂ =Â 0.65) between two groups. Our analysis demonstrated that compared to conventional HA, SA may be associated with lower incidence of DGE after PD without increasing the risk of clinically significant POPF, anastomotic leak or mortality. However, it is associated with higher rate of anastomotic bleeding which mandates careful and precise haemostasis of the stapled line. Considering the current limited evidence, no definitive conclusion can be drawn. Future research is required.",10.1016/j.ijsu.2017.09.071,,,,395
597,Weight loss and co-morbidity resolution between different races and ethnicities after gastric bypass.,"Several studies have demonstrated that minorities and Hispanic ethnicities have disproportionally greater burden of morbid obesity in the United States. However, the majority of bariatric procedures are performed in the non-Hispanic white population. The objective of this study was to investigate the weight loss and remission of obesity-related co-morbidities based on race and ethnicity. The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery prospective, multicenter, observational study was used to collect patients from 10 different health centers across the United States. Retrospective analysis of a prospective, multicenter, observational study over a 5-year follow-up. All patients who underwent primary gastric bypass and provided racial/ethnic information were included in the study (n = 1695). Regardless of race or ethnicity, total weight loss was maintained over a 5-year follow-up, which included 87% of the original cohort. However, whites had on average 1.94% higher adjusted total weight loss compared with blacks (P < .0001). After adjusting for confounders there were no significant differences in resolution of co-morbidities, including diabetes. All patients regardless of race or ethnicity have significant and sustained total weight loss and resolution of co-morbidities after gastric bypass at 5-year follow-up.",10.1016/j.soard.2019.09.061,,,,396
1502,Maximal weight loss after banded and unbanded laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a randomized controlled trial.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) leads to significant weight loss and correction of co-morbidities in most patients. Banded LRYGB was designed to enhance weight loss and avoid weight regain. A randomized controlled pilot trial was designed to comparatively analyze the results and complications of banded (6.5 cm) and unbanded LRYGB. The present study was an interim analysis focused on morbidity, mortality, and maximal weight loss. The 60 patients were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 underwent unbanded LRYGB (n = 30) and group 2 underwent banded LRYGB (n = 30). No differences were found between the 2 groups in terms of age, gender, body mass index, or operative time. No significant differences were found in the percentage of excess weight loss and body mass index at 6, 12, and 24 months between the 2 groups. The frequency of complications was similar in both groups; 1 patient required band removal because of stenosis at the level of the mesh. The weight loss pattern in both groups was similar at 1 and 2 years postoperatively. Proper assessment of weight maintenance and late weight regain will require longer follow-up.",10.1016/j.soard.2007.11.006,,,,397
794,Application value of enhanced recovery after surgery for total laparoscopic uncut Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy after distal gastrectomy.,"To evaluate the safety and feasibility of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) for total laparoscopic uncut Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy after distal gastrectomy. The clinical data of 42 patients who were divided into an ERAS group (n = 20) and a control group (n = 22) were collected. The observed indicators included operation conditions, postoperative clinical indexes, and postoperative serum stress indexes. Measurement data following a normal distribution are presented as mean Â± SD and were analyzed by t-test. Count data were analyzed by Ï‡2 test. The operative time, volume of intraoperative blood loss, and number of patients with conversion to open surgery were not significantly different between the two groups. Postoperative clinical indexes, including the time to initial anal exhaust, time to initial liquid diet intake, time to out-of-bed activity, and duration of hospital stay of patients without complications, were significantly different between the two groups (t = 2.045, 8.685, 2.580, and 4.650, respectively, P < 0.05 for all). However, the time to initial defecation, time to abdominal drainage-tube removal, and the early postoperative complications were not significantly different between the two groups. Regarding postoperative complications, on the first and third days after the operation, the white blood cell count (WBC) and C reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in the ERAS group were significantly lower than those in the control group. The perioperative ERAS program for total laparoscopic uncut Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy after distal gastrectomy is safe and effective and should be popularized. Additionally, this program can also reduce the duration of hospital stay and improve the degree of comfort and satisfaction of patients.",10.3748/wjg.v24.i4.504,,,,398
232,Barrett's Esophagus in Obese Patient Post-Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: a Systematic Review.,"Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a relative contraindication for sleeve gastrectomy, but not for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RNY). However, studies assessing the effect of RNY on BE are limited. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of obese patients who also had BE and underwent RNY. We conducted a systematic review of literature using multiple search engines from inception to January 2021. The primary outcome of interest was the rate of BE resolution post-RNY. This was reported as a proportion with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Publication bias was assessed by funnels plots and the classic fail test. Forest plots were used to report pooled effect estimates. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 and p-value. The final search included 4389 citations, 16 were reviewed in full text, and 9 were included in the final analysis, including 7 manuscripts and 2 recent meeting abstracts. In the 9 studies, 104 patients had BE and underwent RNY. On random effect modeling, the rate of complete remission of intestinal metaplasia (CRIM) was 50% [95%CI: 40-61%], pâ€‰=â€‰0.937, I2â€‰=â€‰4.6%, Qâ€‰=â€‰8.4, pâ€‰=â€‰0.396. The pooled rate of BE improvement was 52% [95%CI: 37-66%], pâ€‰=â€‰0.8, I2â€‰=â€‰16.5%, Qâ€‰=â€‰4.8, pâ€‰=â€‰0.31. Complete remission of dysplasia (CRD) was also reported in 4 of 6 patients. Despite the limited data, a majority of patient with BE who underwent RNY for weight loss had remission or improvement in BE on follow-up endoscopy.

This meta-analysis was performed with the aim of summarizing the available evidence on weight loss, remission of comorbidities, and quality of life in LRYGB and LSG, complementing the current literature. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library from January 2012 to June 2023 for randomized controlled trials and non-randomized interventional studies. We finally selected 18 eligible studies. LRYGB resulted in greater weight loss compared with LSG at 5 years [WMD= -7.65Â kg/mÂ², 95% confidence interval (CI) -11.54 to -3.76, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0001], but there exists high heterogeneity with IÂ²=84%. Resolution rate of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.60, 95%Cl 0.41-0.87, pâ€‰=â€‰0.007) and dyslipidemia (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.44, 95%Cl 0.23-0.84, pâ€‰=â€‰0.01) was higher in the LRYGB group than that in the LSG group at 5 years. There was no difference between LRYGB and LSG for remission of hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. No differences were observed in the QoL after LRYGB or LSG. Morbidity was lower in the LSG group (WMD = -0.07, 95% CI: -0.13, -0.02, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01) than in the LRYGB group. No statistically significant difference was found in mortality between the two procedures. At 5 years after surgery, LRYGB resulted in greater weight loss and achieved better remission rate of T2D and dyslipidemia than LSG. However, LSG has a lower morbidity rate than that of LRYGB.",10.1186/s12893-024-02512-1,,,,400
347,"Surgical, metabolic, and prognostic outcomes for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus sleeve gastrectomy: a systematic review.","The purpose of this systematic review was to study 4 different aspects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYBG) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are two commonly performed bariatric procedures. This systematic review aims to compare RYGB with SG when it comes to weight changes, and cardiometabolic risk profile. Another aim was to evaluate laparoscopic and robotic techniques for both surgeries. PubMED, Cochrane Library, and JAMA Network were searched for articles evaluating RYGB and SG from 2005-2020. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Four different categories were analyzed comparing RYGB with SG as well as robotic versus laparoscopic approach. The Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) checklist was used to assess the quality of evidence in the studies included in this systematic review. A total of 29 studies were included looking at different aspects of RYGB and SG. RYGB is superior to SG for weight loss, improved or complete remission of cholesterol and hypertensive medications. Consensus is lacking regarding decrease in BMI, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. There is lack of evidence regarding decrease of incidence of MI or stroke. For RYGB and SG, the majority of studies found that the robotic technique was more expensive and took longer. RYGB when compared with SG was associated with larger weight loss, decreased or cessation of cholesterol and hypertensive medications, and lower cholesterol. Decrease in BMI had varying results, with RYGB being superior in more studies, while there was no difference in other studies. There was a lack of evidence to support if RYGB or SG was superior to decreasing triglyceride levels. For both RYGB and SG, the robotic approach was costlier and took more operating time versus the laparoscopic approach.",10.1016/j.soard.2021.06.020,,,,401
250,Gastric Bypass Resolves Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD) in Low-BMI Patients: A Prospective Cohort Study.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) reflects the multifactorial pathogenesis of fatty liver disease in metabolically sick patients. The effects of metabolic surgery on MAFLD have not been investigated. This study assesses the impact of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on MAFLD in a prototypical cohort outside the guidelines for obesity surgery. Twenty patients were enrolled in this prospective, single-arm trial investigating the effects of RYGB on advanced metabolic disease (DRKS00004605). Inclusion criteria were an insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes, body mass index of 25 to 35Â kg/m 2 , glucagon-stimulated C-peptide of >1.5Â ng/mL, glycated hemoglobin >7%, and age 18 to 70 years. A RYGB with intraoperative liver biopsies and follow-up liver biopsies 3 years later was performed. Steatohepatitis was assessed by expert liver pathologists. Data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and a P value <0.05 was defined as significant. MAFLD completely resolved in all patients 3 years after RYGB while fibrosis improved as well. Fifty-five percent were off insulin therapy with a significant reduction in glycated hemoglobin (8.45Â±0.27% to 7.09Â±0.26%, P =0.0014). RYGB reduced systemic and hepatic nitrotyrosine levels likely through upregulation of NRF1 and its dependent antioxidative and mitochondrial genes. In addition, central metabolic regulators such as SIRT1 and FOXO1 were upregulated while de novo lipogenesis was reduced and Î²-oxidation was improved in line with an improvement of insulin resistance. Lastly, gastrointestinal hormones and adipokines secretion were changed favorably. RYGB is a promising therapy for MAFLD even in low-body mass index patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes with complete histologic resolution. RYGB restores the oxidative balance, adipose tissue function, and gastrointestinal hormones.",10.1097/SLA.0000000000005631,,,,402
643,Abdominal pain and symptoms before and after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Despite increased emphasis on patient-reported outcomes, few studies have focused on abdominal pain symptoms before and after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The aim of this study was to quantify chronic abdominal pain (CAP) in relation to RYGB. Patients with morbid obesity planned for RYGB were invited to participate at a tertiary referral centre from February 2014 to June 2015. Participants completed a series of seven questionnaires before and 2â€‰years after RYGB. CAP was defined as patient-reported presence of long-term or recurrent abdominal pain lasting for more than 3â€‰months. A total of 236 patients were included, of whom 209 (88Â·6 per cent) attended follow-up. CAP was reported by 28 patients (11Â·9 per cent) at baseline and 60 (28Â·7 per cent) at follow-up (Pâ€‰<â€‰0Â·001). Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) scores (except reflux scores) and symptoms of anxiety increased from baseline to follow-up. Most quality of life (QoL) scores (except role emotional, mental health and mental component scores) also increased. At follow-up, patients with CAP had higher GSRS scores than those without CAP, with large effect sizes for abdominal pain and indigestion syndrome scores. Patients with CAP had more symptoms of anxiety, higher levels of catastrophizing and lower QoL scores. Baseline CAP seemed to predict CAP at follow-up. The prevalence of CAP is higher 2â€‰years after RYGB compared with baseline values.",10.1002/bjs5.50148,,,,403
997,Body Image & Quality of Life: Changes With Gastric Bypass and Body Contouring.,"Bariatric surgery has emerged as an effective method of combating the morbid obesity epidemic. However, the massive weight loss that follows may result in contour changes that can affect body image and quality of life. Our study examines the effects and consequences of bariatric surgery and subsequent body contouring on body image and quality of life. Patients were prospectively followed up through their experience with bariatric surgery and subsequent body contouring surgery. Using 2 validated survey instruments, the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire and the Short Form 36 (SF-36), patients completed questionnaires preoperatively and at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Mean scores were determined by repeated measures analyses of variance F tests. One hundred seventy-five patients were surveyed before bariatric surgery, with noted declines in survey completion at 6, 12, and 24 months. Appearance Evaluation scores improved significantly at all intervals (P = 0.0033), as did Body Area Satisfaction Scale and Appearance Orientation scores (P = 0.0079 and P = 0.044, respectively). While Overweight Preoccupation and Self-Classified Weight scores decreased over time, only the latter was significant (P < 0.0001). The composite SF-36 score for patients awaiting bariatric surgery (54.1%) with postoperative scores at 6 (67.6%,), 12 (at 74.0%), and 24 (76.7%) months being significantly higher (P < 0.0001). The body contouring group consisted of 41 patients who primarily had lower body procedures, with 31 patients surveyed at 6 months and 27 patients at 12 months. For this cohort, Appearance Evaluation and Body Area Satisfaction Scale scores both improved significantly (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0005, respectively) whereas Appearance Orientation scores declined significantly (P = 0.0055). Both Overweight Preoccupation and Self-Classified Weight scores decreased with only the latter being statistically significant (P = 0.0286). Postoperative SF-36 scores at 6 (72.9%) and 12 (64.5%) months were no different than patients awaiting body contouring (71.3%). Using 2 validated survey instruments, we show that patients undergoing bariatric surgery have improvements in body image and quality of life. Subsequent postbariatric body contouring surgery results in further improvements in body image. Our findings provide measurable evidence for the value of body contouring after significant weight loss, which may favor greater insurance coverage for this patient population.",10.1097/SAP.0000000000000788,,,,404
1337,Preoperative very low-calorie diet and operative outcome after laparoscopic gastric bypass: a randomized multicenter study.,"A 14-day very low-calorie diet (VLCD) regimen before a laparoscopic gastric bypass procedure will improve perioperative and postoperative outcomes. Multicenter, randomized, single-blind study. Five high-volume bariatric centers in Sweden, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Spain, and Belgium. Two hundred ninety-eight morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass from March 1, 2009, through December 5, 2010. Patients were randomly allocated to a 2-week preoperative VLCD regimen or no preoperative dietary restriction (control group). Operating time, surgeon's perceived difficulty of the operation, liver lacerations, intraoperative bleeding and complications, 30-day weight loss, and morbidity. Mean (SD) preoperative weight change was -4.9 (3.6) kg in the VLCD group vs -0.4 (3.2) kg in the control group (P < .001). Although the surgeon's perceived difficulty of the procedure was lower in the VLCD group (median [interquartile range], 26 [15-42] vs 35 [18-50] mm on a visual analog scale; P = .04), no differences were found regarding mean (SD) operating time (81 [21] vs 80 [23] min; P = .53), estimated blood loss (P = .62), or intraoperative complications (P = .88). At the 30-day follow-up, the number of complications was greater in the control compared with the VLCD group (18 vs 8; P = .04). Although weight reduction with a 14-day VLCD regimen before laparoscopic gastric bypass performed in high-volume centers seems to reduce the perceived difficulty of the procedure, only minor effects on operating time, intraoperative complications, and short-term weight loss could be expected. However, the finding of reduced postoperative complication rates suggests that such a regimen should be recommended before bariatric surgery.",10.1001/archsurg.2011.273,,,,405
740,Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Is More Effective than Sleeve Gastrectomy in Improving Postprandial Glycaemia and Lipaemia in Non-diabetic Morbidly Obese Patients: a Short-term Follow-up Analysis.,"We aimed to compare the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) on postprandial glucose and lipid metabolism in addition to weight loss and fasting metabolic profile, in non-diabetic patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Seventy-one patients were consecutively recruited and studied preoperatively, 3 and 6Â months after surgery. Of these, 28 underwent RYGB (7 males, age 38â€‰Â±â€‰9Â years, BMI 46.9â€‰Â±â€‰5.0Â kg/m2), and 43 SG (9 males, age 38â€‰Â±â€‰9Â years, BMI 50.2â€‰Â±â€‰7.0Â kg/m2). A semi-liquid mixed meal was consumed, and blood samples were taken before, and every 30Â min after meal ingestion up to 180Â min postprandially, for measurement of glucose, insulin, and lipids. The overall postprandial response was assessed as area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). Baseline metabolic parameters were similar between RYGB and SG. Both groups experienced comparable weight loss, and a similar improvement in fasting glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance. Total and LDL cholesterol levels were lower at 6Â months after RYGB compared to SG, while there was no difference in HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. Glucose AUC was lower after RYGB compared to SG at both 3 (pâ€‰=â€‰0.008) and 6Â months (pâ€‰=â€‰0.016), without any difference in postprandial insulin response. Triglyceride AUC was also lower in RYGB vs. SG at 3 and 6Â months (pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.001). RYGB is superior to SG in improving postprandial glycaemia and lipaemia and cholesterol profile 6Â months postoperatively in non-diabetic, severely obese patients. These findings imply procedure-specific effects, such as the malabsorptive nature of RYGB, and less likely a different incretin postoperative response.",10.1007/s11695-018-3454-y,,,,406
1444,Bariatric surgery for the treatment of morbid obesity: a meta-analysis of weight loss outcomes for laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and laparoscopic gastric bypass.,"Bariatric surgery has emerged as an important tool in the fight against morbid obesity. However, reviewers have noted that there is a scarcity of long-term clinical surveillance data for bariatric surgery beyond 1-year follow-up and that a high percentage of patients are lost to follow-up, raising questions regarding the accuracy of current outcomes estimates. A meta-analysis of clinical reports providing bariatric surgery weight loss outcomes for morbidly obese patients was conducted over the period 2003-2007. Studies included were randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, and consecutive case series involving patients receiving either laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) or laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGB) surgery. Included studies involved n = 7,383 patients and were largely academic hospital-based (78.6%) and retrospective in design (71.4%). Weight loss outcome was defined by percent excess weight loss (%EWL). Composite estimates showed a significantly greater %EWL for LGB surgery (62.6%) compared to LAGB (49.4%). The superiority of LGB persisted at all three postsurgical time points examined (1, 2, and >3 years). Problems were identified regarding incomplete or suboptimal data reporting in many studies reviewed, and high patient attrition was evident at 2-year (49.8% LAGB, 75.2% LGB) and >3-year (82.6% LAGB, 89% LGB) end points. This meta-analysis confirms the superiority of LGB to LAGB in %EWL found in earlier studies. Although problems in study quality raised significant concerns regarding the validity of current weight loss estimates in this area, there was no evidence of publication bias.",10.1007/s11695-009-9927-2,,,,407
1148,Prophylactic PPI help reduce marginal ulcers after gastric bypass surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies.,"Marginal ulceration after gastric bypass surgery is a recognized complication and has been reported in 1-16% of patients. There is evidence that acidity may play a role in the disease pathophysiology and it is a common practice for bariatric surgeons to begin a prophylactic course of proton pump inhibitors (PPI), postoperatively. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched using the most comprehensive timeline for each database up to January 2012. Studies that included patients undergoing gastric bypass who received a prophylactic course of PPI postoperatively were eligible. Two reviewers independently selected trials and extracted data. The primary outcome was the incidence of marginal ulcers diagnosed on the basis of endoscopic findings. Inverse variance random effects models were used to estimate odds ratio (OR) and weighted proportion of ulcers. Odds ratio and weighted pooled proportion with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported. The strategic search identified 167 citations. A total of seven studies involving 2,917 participants were eligible for inclusion and 2,114 were used for analysis. The weighted pooled proportion of ulcer formation in PPI groups including all seven studies (four single group cohort studies and PPI arm of three cohort studies) was 5.0% [95% CI 2-10%] (N = 1,407). The OR of marginal ulcer formation comparing PPI to no PPI for three comparative cohort studies was 0.50 [95% CI 0.28-0.90, p = 0.02] (N = 1,022) with low heterogeneity (I(2) = 12%) showing that the PPI group significantly experienced twice less ulceration with PPI treatment compared to no PPI treatment. This finding suggests a significant incremental benefit of prophylactic PPI in reducing marginal ulcer after gastric bypass surgery. Prospective randomized trials are needed to further define the role of PPI following gastric bypass surgery.",10.1007/s00464-014-3794-1,,,,408
1428,A review of weight loss following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass vs restrictive bariatric surgery: impact on adiponectin and insulin.,"Bariatric surgery is a common procedure often used to ameliorate comorbidities associated with obesity, including type 2 diabetes. Substantial weight loss leads to alterations in inflammation and insulin sensitivity as well as numerous metabolic and physiologic pathways. Several inflammatory markers have been evaluated, yet adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory adipokine, has not been fully investigated. Adiponectin may play a key role as a mediator between obesity and inflammation, as lower blood levels are more commonly associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes and because adiponectin lessens insulin resistance. This review evaluates outcome variables from patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or restrictive bariatric surgery to compare and contrast any differential surgical impacts on weight loss, adiponectin, and insulin. A systematic literature review was conducted using a PubMed search. Published studies from 1999 to 2009 that measured blood levels of adiponectin and insulin in bariatric surgery patients prior to and at least 6 months after surgery were included. Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria for evaluation. RYGB surgery compared to restrictive surgery led to significantly greater weight loss and improvements in adiponectin and insulin sensitivity. Despite significant weight loss, many patients did not achieve ""healthy"" body mass index or normalization of inflammatory markers. While RYGB surgery appears to more favorably influence body weight and inflammatory markers, data are insufficient to fully understand the impact of bariatric surgery on changes in adiponectin and insulin and related health implications. Long-term research is needed to more thoroughly evaluate inflammatory outcomes following these two bariatric surgery procedures.",10.1007/s11695-010-0089-z,,,,409
697,"The Effects of Probiotic Supplements on Blood Markers of Endotoxin and Lipid Peroxidation in Patients Undergoing Gastric Bypass Surgery; a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Clinical Trial with 13Â Months Follow-Up.","The effect of probiotic supplements among subjects undergoing bariatric surgery indicates conflicting results. Moreover, whether these effects remain after ceasing the treatment remained to be elucidated. This study was conducted to assess the effect of probiotic supplements on blood markers of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharides-binding protein: LBP), inflammation and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde: MDA) in patients with morbid obesity undergoing the one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). This study is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, and randomized clinical trial and 9Â months of additional follow-up. Forty-six morbid obese patients undergoing OAGB were randomized to 4Â months of probiotic or placebo supplements. Anthropometric indices and blood concentration of LBP, inflammatory markers, MDA, vitamin D3, and B12 were measured at 0, 4, and 13Â months of study. Probiotic supplements could improve serum LBP (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.039), TNF-Î± (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.005), vitamin B12 (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.03), vitamin D3 (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001), and weight loss (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01) at month 4 in comparison to placebo; however, only serum MDA concentrations decreased significantly in the probiotic group compared with those in the placebo group (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.013) at the end of follow-up period. It was observed that 4Â months probiotic supplementation compared with placebo prohibited an elevation in the LBP levels and improved serum TNF-Î± and 25-OH vitamin D3 concentrations and weight loss in patients undergoing the OAGB surgery. However, these effects did not persist 9Â months after the cessation of the treatment. Further investigations are required to find how long supplementation and which dosage of it can benefit body status for the long-term.

550,Usefulness of Abdominal Drain in Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Background: Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the most common procedures to treat morbid obesity. Abdominal drains are often placed during the operation to detect complications earlier. The aim of this study was to assess the benefit of routine drain placement during laparoscopic RYGB. Materials and Methods: A consecutive series of patients undergoing laparoscopic RYGB between 2017 and 2018 was analyzed. The sample was randomized before the procedure into two groups: with abdominal drain (G1) and without abdominal drain placement (G2). Patients with intraoperative complications were excluded from the randomization. Postoperative complications and pain (visual analogue scale) were compared between groups. Results: A total of 84 patients were included; 45 belonged to G1 and 39 to G2. Mean age (G1 44 years versus G2 48 years) and body mass index (G1 43â€‰kg/m2 versus G2 44â€‰kg/m2) were similar in both groups. There were no significant differences between groups in preoperative comorbidities. Mean operative time was 92 minutes in both groups. Mean pain score at postoperative day 0 was similar in both groups (G1 3.2 versus G2 3.5, Pâ€‰=â€‰.58), but was higher in G1 at postoperative day 1 (G1 3.1, G2 1.1, Pâ€‰=â€‰.02). Postoperative Clavien-Dindo I-II complications were similar in both groups (G1 9% versus G2 1%, Pâ€‰=â€‰.37). No major complications, reoperations, or 30-day mortality occurred in the entire cohort. Conclusions: Drain placement in laparoscopic RYGB was associated with greater postoperative pain and did not show benefits in early detection of postoperative complications. Routine placement of abdominal drain in laparoscopic RYGB might not be recommended.",10.1089/lap.2019.0783,,,,411
404,Gastric Bypass Compared with Sleeve Gastrectomy for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"The effects of bariatric procedures on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remain unclear. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to compare the impact of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) on NAFLD/NASH. Patients submitted to RYGB presented significant reduction of steatohepatitis (RD: 0.53; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.74) and fibrosis (RD: 0.26; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.37). SG caused a significant reduction of steatohepatitis (RD: 0.42; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.57), but not of fibrosis (RD: 0.20; 95% CI -0.00 to 0.39). The NAFLD Activity Score was significantly improved after both procedures, as well as biochemical tests. No difference was found between RYGB and SG regarding the histopathological outcomes. SG and RYGB are equivalently effective for treating NAFLD/NASH.",10.1007/s11695-021-05412-y,,,,412
841,Single Anastomosis Duodeno-Ileal Switch (SADIS): A Systematic Review of Efficacy and Safety.,"Owing to the possibility of weight regain after the long-term follow-up of gastric bypass patients and because of the high morbidity of biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch, single-anastomosis duodeno-ileal switch (SADIS) has emerged as a rescue procedure in bariatric surgery. The purpose of this review is to summarize the literature data on SADIS. University Hospital, NY. A comprehensive literature review was performed through October 2016 to identify English studies on SADIS performed in human subjects. Outcomes of interest were technical considerations, postoperative complications, weight loss outcome, comorbidity resolution rate, and nutritional deficiency after SADIS. A total of 12 studies including 581 SADIS patients (217 males and 364 females) were included. SADIS was a primary procedure in 508 patients (87.4%) and a conversion procedure in 73 patients (12.6%). The length of common limb was 300Â cm in 54.2%, 250Â cm in 23%, and 200Â cm in 13.4% of patients. Anastomosis technique was a linear stapler in 26.7% and a hand sewn suture technique in 73.3% of patients. Diarrhea was the most common complication (1.2%). The average %EWL was 30% at 3Â months, 55% at 6Â months, 70% at 1Â year, and 85% at 2Â years. Co-morbidity resolution rate was 74.1% for type 2 diabetes mellitus, 96.3% for hypertension, 68.3% for dyslipidemia, 63.3% for obstructive sleep apnea, and 87.5% for GERD. Overall, vitamin A, selenium, and iron deficiency were the most common nutritional deficiencies with the possibility of the protein malnutrition in up to 34% of the patients when measured. As a modified bariatric procedure, SADIS has promising outcomes for weight loss and comorbidity resolution in morbidly obese patients. When measured, there was a high prevalence of macro-nutrient deficiencies following SADIS. There is a high technical variability, and long-term data are required before any meaningful conclusion can be made.",10.1007/s11695-017-2838-8,,,,413
324,A Specifically Tailored Multistrain Probiotic and Micronutrient Mixture Affects Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease-Related Markers in Patients with Obesity after Mini Gastric Bypass Surgery.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is frequent among patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Beyond weight reduction, dietary supplements like micronutrients or probiotics that modify insulin resistance and lipotoxicity can be used to prevent or delay the progression of liver disease. We evaluated the effect of a dietary approach with a specifically tailored multistrain probiotic and micronutrient mixture compared with a basic care micronutrient supplement on serum alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) in obese patients after mini gastric bypass (MGB) surgery. This randomized, double-blind, controlled trial included 60 obese patients (age: 40Â Â±Â 10 y; BMI: 44Â Â±Â 3 kg/mÂ²). Patients received a combination of specifically tailored multistrain probiotic powder and a specific micronutrient mixture (Pro+SM) or a control treatment consisting of a placebo and a basic care micronutrient mixture (Con+BM), with some micronutrients in lower doses than SM, for 12 wk after hospital discharge. Primary (serum ALAT) and secondary outcomes [serum aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), fatty liver index, NAFLD fibrosis score, glucose metabolism, blood pressure (BP), heart rate] were assessed at week 0 and week 12. Data were analyzed using unpaired Student's t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests to compare the changes due to each treatment to one another. A total of 48 patients were included in the analyses. Changes in serum ALAT concentrations did not differ between groups. Compared with Con+BM, Pro+SM improved serum ASAT (difference: -8.0 U/L, 95% CI: -17.0, -4.0; P = 0.043), NAFLD fibrosis score (difference: -0.39; 95% CI: -0.78, 0; P = 0.048), serum triglycerides (difference: -22.8 mg/dL; 95% CI: -45.6, -0.1; P = 0.049) and the visceral adiposity index (difference: -0.70; 95% CI: -1.31, -0.08; P = 0.027). Supplementation with a specifically tailored probiotic and micronutrient mixture improved NAFLD-related markers more than a basic micronutrient mixture in obese patients following MGB surgery. The trial was registered under clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03585413.",10.1093/jn/nxab392,,,,414
499,The use of Ursolit for gallstone prophylaxis following bariatric surgery: a randomized-controlled trial.,"Although bariatric surgery (BS) predisposes patients to development of gallstone formation, a preventive strategy is still in debate. To compare the incidence of gallstone formation between patients treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) vs. placebo for a duration of 6 months following BS. This multicenter randomized, double-blind controlled trial entails treatment with UDCA vs. an identical-looking placebo. The primary outcome was gallstone formation, as measured by abdominal ultrasound. The data of 209 subjects were enrolled in the study, and 92 subjects completed the study and were analyzed (nâ€‰=â€‰46 for each study group). The high dropout rate was mainly due to difficulties in adding more medications and swallowing the pill. Among the subjects who completed the study, 77.2% were women, and their mean age and pre-surgery BMI were 42.2â€‰Â±â€‰10.2Â years and 44.4â€‰Â±â€‰6.1Â kg/m2, respectively. Gallstone formation was recorded in 45.7% (nâ€‰=â€‰21) vs. 23.9% (nâ€‰=â€‰11) of subjects among placebo vs. UDCA groups, respectively, pâ€‰=â€‰0.029. Subgroup-analysis, according to surgery type, found that the results were significant only for SG subjects (pâ€‰=â€‰0.041), although the same trend was observed for OAGB/RYGB. Excess Weight Loss percent (%EWL) at 6 months post-surgery was 66.0â€‰Â±â€‰17.1% vs. 71.8â€‰Â±â€‰19.5% for the placebo and UDCA groups, respectively; pâ€‰=â€‰0.136. A trend towards a reduction in prescribed comorbidity medications was noted within-groups during the follow-up period, as compared to baseline, with no between-group differences (pâ€‰â‰¥â€‰0.246). Moreover, no between-group differences were found for blood test results (pâ€‰â‰¥â€‰0.063 for all). Administration of UDCA significantly decreased gallstone formation at 6 months at following BS.

548,A meta-analysis of the medium- and long-term effects of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) are two representative bariatric surgeries. This study aimed to compare the effects of the LSG and LRYGB based on high-quality analysis and massive amount of data. For this study databases of PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, Medline, and Cochrane Library were searched for articles published until January 2019 comparing the outcomes of LSG and LRYGB. This study included 28 articles. Overall, 9038 patients (4597, LSG group; 4441, LRYGB group) were included. The remission rate of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the LRYGB group was superior to that in the LSG group at the 3-years follow-up. Five-year follow-up results showed that LRYGB had an advantage over LSG for the percentage of excess weight loss and remission of T2DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and abnormally low-density lipoprotein. In terms of the long-term effects of bariatric surgery, the effect of LRYGB was better than of LSG.",10.1186/s12893-020-00695-x,,,,416
588,Esophageal achalasia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity.,"The development of achalasia in patients with a prior Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is rare and it often remains unclear whether the esophageal motility disorder is a pre-existing condition in the obese patient or develops de novo after the procedure. The aim of this study was to review the available evidence regarding the management of patients with achalasia after a RYGB. Intra-sphincteric injection of botulinum toxin and pneumatic dilatation can be used to eliminate the functional obstruction at the level of the gastroesophageal junction. However, considering that achalasia patients after RYGB are often young and these treatment modalities have shown worse long-term outcomes, endoscopic or surgical myotomy is preferred. Per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a very effective first line of treatment, and as RYGB is an excellent anti-reflux operation per se, post-POEM reflux may not be an issue in these patients. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) is also an effective and safe therapy in achalasia patients with RYGB anatomy, and the gastric remnant can be safely used to perform a fundoplication to cover the myotomy. LHM and POEM are both acceptable primary treatment modalities in this setting. Further studies are needed to elucidate the pathophysiology and optimal management of patients with achalasia after RYGB.",10.1007/s13304-019-00688-3,,,,417
595,Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for 5-year hypertension remission in obese patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,": Controversial results exist on mid-term effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy on hypertension remission. The aim of the present systematic review was to study 5-year hypertension remission after both procedures. One-year hypertension remission and SBP and DBP pressure change at 1 and 5 years after both surgical techniques were also evaluated. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Thirty-two articles were included (six randomized controlled trials, 18 cohort and eight case-control studies). The proportion of patients with hypertension remission was greater for those treated with gastric bypass compared with sleeve gastrectomy at 5 years (RRâ€Š=â€Š1.26, 95% CIâ€Š=â€Š1.07-1.48) and 1 year (RRâ€Š=â€Š1.14, 95% CIâ€Š=â€Š1.06-1.21). Gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy did not differ in terms of SBP or DBP change. Patients treated with gastric bypass present a higher hypertension remission rate at 1 and 5 years.",10.1097/HJH.0000000000002255,,,,418
393,What Is Weight Loss After Bariatric Surgery Expressed in Percentage Total Weight Loss (%TWL)? A Systematic Review.,"Percentage total weight loss (%TWL) might be better than percentage excess weight loss to express weight loss in bariatric surgery. In this systematic review, performed according to the PRISMA statement, results of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) are assessed in %TWL. A total of 13,426 studies were screened and 49 included, reporting data of 24,760 patients. The results show that, despite limiting data, LRYGB is favorable over LSG in terms of weight loss in short-term follow-up. Although recent guidelines recommend to use %TWL when reporting outcome in bariatric surgery, this study shows that there is still insufficient quality data in %TWL, especially on LSG. The use of %TWL as the primary outcome measure in bariatric surgery should be encouraged.",10.1007/s11695-021-05394-x,,,,419
1447,Comparison of weight loss and body composition changes with four surgical procedures.,"A paucity of information is available on the comparative body composition changes after bariatric procedures. The present study reports on the body mass index (BMI) and body composition changes after 4 procedures by a single group. At the initial consultation, the weight and body composition of the patients undergoing 4 different bariatric procedures were measured by bioimpedance (Tanita 310). Follow-up examinations were performed at 1 year and at subsequent visits after surgery. Analysis of variance was used to compare the postprocedure BMI and body composition. Analysis of covariance was used to adjust for baseline differences. A total of 101 gastric bypass (GB) patients were evaluated at 19.1 + or - 10.6 months, 49 biliopancreatic diversion with the duodenal switch (BPD/DS) patients at 27.5 + or - 16.3 months, 41 adjustable gastric band (AGB) patients at 21.4 + or - 9.2 months, and 30 sleeve gastrectomy (SG) patients at 16.7 + or - 5.6 months (P <.0001). No differences were found in patient age or gender among the 4 groups. The mean preoperative BMI was significantly different among the 4 groups (P <.0001): 61.4 kg/m(2), 53.2, 46.7, and 44.3 kg/m(2) for the SG, BPD/DS, GB, and AGB group, respectively. The postoperative BMI adjusted for baseline differences was 27.8 (difference 23.6 + or - 8.3), 32.5 (difference 15.6 + or - 5.0), 37.2 (difference 18.2 + or - 8.2), and 39.5 kg/m(2) (difference 7.5 + or - 4.3) for the BPD/DS, GB, SG, and AGB groups, respectively (P <.0001). The percentage of excess weight loss was 84%, 70%, 49%, and 38% for the BPD/DS, GB, SG, and AGB groups, respectively (P <.0001). The postoperative percentage of body fat adjusted for baseline differences was 25.7% (23.9% + or - 7.0%) 32.7% (16.1% + or - 10.5%) 37.7% (16.7% + or - 5.6%), and 42% (6.0% + or - 6.8%) for the BPD/DS, GB, SG, and AGB groups, respectively (P <.0001). The lean body mass changes were reciprocal. Although the BPD/DS procedure reduced the BMI the most effectively and promoted fat loss, all the procedures produced weight loss. The AGB procedure resulted in less body fat loss within 21.5 months than SG within 16.7 months. Longer term observation is indicated.",10.1016/j.soard.2009.04.001,,,,420
1125,Predictors of Remission of T2DM and Metabolic Effects after Laparoscopic Roux-en-y Gastric Bypass in Obese Indian Diabetics-a 5-Year Study.,"Bariatric surgery has proven results for diabetes remission in obese diabetics. Despite this, a lot of ambiguity exists around patient selection. The objectives of this study are the following: (1) evaluation of results of laparoscopic Roux-en-y gastric bypass (LRYGB) in obese type 2 diabetic (T2DM) Indian patients at 5 years and (2) to define predictors of success after surgery. This is a prospective observational study. One hundred six Indian patients underwent LRYGB from January 2004 to July 2009. Patients were evaluated for percent excess weight loss (%EWL) and remission of T2DM. Mean age 50.34â€‰Â±â€‰9.08 years, mean waist circumference 129.8â€‰Â±â€‰20.8 cm, mean weight 119.2â€‰Â±â€‰23.6 kg, mean BMI 45.01â€‰Â±â€‰7.9 kg/m(2), and mean duration of diabetes 8.2â€‰Â±â€‰6.2 years. At 5 years, mean EWL% was 61.4â€‰Â±â€‰20.3, mean weight regain of 8.6â€‰Â±â€‰6.2 kg was seen in 63.6 %, mean glycosylated hemoglobin dropped from 8.7â€‰Â±â€‰2.1 to 6.2â€‰Â±â€‰01.3 %, mean triglycerides declined by 31 %, and serum high density lipoprotein rose by 18.4 %. Mean low-density lipoprotein levels declined by 6.8 %. Age, BMI, fasting C-peptide levels, duration of T2DM, and pre-op use of insulin emerged as significant predictors of success after surgery. One hundred percent remission was seen in patients with T2DM <5 years. LRYGB is safe and efficacious for long-term remission of T2DM (BMIâ€‰â‰¥â€‰35 kg/m(2)). In a country with the second largest population of type 2 diabetics in the world, predictors of success after surgery can help in prioritizing patients who have a greater chance to benefit from metabolic surgery.",10.1007/s11695-014-1501-x,,,,421
95,Non-Operative Approach to Contained Perforated Marginal Ulcers: A Systematic Review and Case Series.,"Perforated marginal ulcers (PMUs) are a rare but known complication of bariatric surgery. Management typically involves prompt surgical intervention, but limited data exists on non-operative approaches. This study reviews published data on non-operative management of PMUs and presents a case series of patients who were managed non-operatively. Our hypothesis is that certain patients with signs of perforation can be successfully managed non-operatively with close observation. We completed a systematic review searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, and clinicaltrials.gov. Ultimately 3 studies described the presentation and non-operative management of 5 patients. Additionally, we prospectively collected data from our institution on all patients who presented between Dec. 2022 and Dec. 2023 with PMUs confirmed on imaging and managed non-operatively. In our literature review, three patients had Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), while two had one anastomosis gastric bypass. One patient required surgery two days after admission. Another underwent elective conversion surgery weeks later for a non-healing ulcer. Two received endoscopic interventions. One patient recovered with nil-per-os (NPO) status, and intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment. The patients in our case series presented with normal vital signs, an average of 30 months after RYGB, and with CT scan signs of perforation. None of these patients required surgical or endoscopic intervention. In conclusion, while perforated marginal ulcers have traditionally been considered a surgical emergency, some patients can be successfully treated with non-operative management. More research is needed to identify the clinical presentation features, comorbidities, and imaging findings of this group.",10.1177/00031348231209533,,,,422
1594,Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding in the treatment of obesity: a systematic literature review.,"We attempted to compare the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding with vertical-banded gastroplasty and gastric bypass. Morbid obesity presents a serious health issue for Western countries, with a rising incidence and a strong association with increased mortality and serious comorbidities, such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular disease. Unfortunately, conservative treatment options have proven ineffective. Surgical interventions, such as vertical-banded gastroplasty (stomach stapling), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and, more recently, laparoscopic gastric banding have been developed with the aim of providing a laparoscopically placed device that is safe and effective in generating substantial weight loss. Electronic databases were systematically searched for references relating to obesity surgery by (1) laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), (2) vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG), and (3) Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Only 6 studies reported comparative results for laparoscopic gastric banding and other surgical procedures. One study reported comparative results for all 3 surgical procedures, and this study was only of moderate quality. In total, 64 studies were found that reported results for LAGB and 57 studies reported results on the comparative procedures. LAGB was associated with a mean short-term mortality rate of approximately 0.05% and an overall median morbidity rate of approximately 11.3%, compared with 0.50% and 23.6% for RYGB, and 0.31% and 25.7% for VBG. Overall, all 3 procedures produced considerable weight loss in patients up to 4 years in the case of LAGB (the maximum follow-up available at the time of the review), and more than 10 years in the case of the comparator procedures. The Australian Safety and Efficacy Register of New Interventional Procedures-Surgical Review Group concluded that the evidence base was of average quality up to 4 years for LAGB. Laparoscopic gastric banding is safer than VBG and RYGB, in terms of short-term mortality rates. LAGB is effective, at least up to 4 years, as are the comparator procedures. Up to 2 years, LAGB results in less weight loss than RYGB; from 2 to 4 years there is no significant difference between LAGB and RYGB, but the quality of data is only moderate. The long-term efficacy of LAGB remains unproven, and evaluation by randomized controlled trials is recommended to define its merits relative to the comparator procedures.",10.1016/S0039-6060(03)00392-1,,,,423
1175,Recruitment and screening for a randomized trial investigating Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus intensive medical management for treatment of type 2 diabetes.,"Large-scale randomized clinical trials are needed to assess the role of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in treating patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Recruitment challenges must be understood. One hundred twenty participants were needed for a prospective randomized controlled trial investigating treatments for hyperglycemia and cardiovascular disease risk factors in patients with T2DM. The trial had two arms-intensive medical management plus a rigorous lifestyle intervention (LS/IMM) versus LS/IMM with RYGB. Medical inclusion criteria included glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) â‰¥ 8.0 % while under the care of a physician and body mass index (BMI) 30.0-39.9 kg/m(2). Another inclusion criterion was expressed willingness to accept randomization and participate fully. Varied recruitment strategies were employed at four academic hospitals in the USA and Taiwan, including referrals, mass media, direct mail to patients drawn from a practice-based database, and direct mail to commercial mailing lists. Between February 2008 and December 2011, 2,648 candidates were phone-screened and 240 were screened on site; 120 participants were eventually randomized. Impediments included stringent medical inclusion criteria and a lack of equipoise (i.e., strong beliefs or preferences) among patients and their personal community-based physicians. To meet timeline requirements, the upper limit for BMI was increased from 34.9 to 39.9 kg/m(2) and an additional site was added. We successfully recruited 120 participants with poorly controlled T2DM and mild to moderate obesity. Participants had to be willing to accept randomization to either surgical or nonsurgical treatments. Recruitment took 4 years.",10.1007/s11695-014-1280-4,,,,424
856,Transoral outlet reduction with full thickness endoscopic suturing for weight regain after gastric bypass: a large multicenter international experience and meta-analysis.,"Many patients who undergo bariatric surgery will experience weight regain and effective strategies are needed to help these patients. A dilated gastrojejunal anastomosis (GJA) has been associated with weight recidivism after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB). Endoscopic transoral outlet reduction (TORe) with a full thickness endoscopic suturing device (Overstitch, Apollo Endosurgery, Austin, TX) is a minimally invasive therapeutic option. The primary aim of this project was to examine the safety and long-term efficacy data from three bariatric surgery centers and to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the existing literature. Patients who underwent TORe with the Overstitch device from Jan 2013 to Nov 2016 at 3 participating bariatric surgery centers were included in the multicenter analysis. For the systematic review and meta-analysis, a comprehensive search of multiple English databases was conducted. Random effects model was used. 130 consecutive patients across three centers underwent TORe with an endolumenal suturing device. These patients (mean age 47; mean BMI 36.8) had experienced 24.6% weight regain from nadir weight after RYGB. Average weight lost at 6, 12, and 18Â months after TORe was 9.31Â Â±Â 6.7Â kg (NÂ =Â 84), 7.75Â Â±Â 8.4Â  kg (NÂ =Â 70), 8Â Â±Â 8.8Â kg (NÂ =Â 46) (pÂ <Â 0.01 for all three time points), respectively. The meta-analysis included 330 patients. The pooled weight lost at 12Â months was 8.4Â kg (95% CI 6.5-10.3) with no significant heterogeneity across included studies (pÂ =Â 0.07). Overall, 14% of patients experienced nausea, 18% had pain and 8% required a repeat EGD. No serious adverse events reported. When implemented as part of a multidisciplinary intervention, TORe using endolumenal suturing is safe, reproducible, and effective approach to manage weight recidivism after RYGB and should be utilized early in the management algorithm of these patients.",10.1007/s00464-017-5671-1,,,,425
792,Clinical and Patient-Centered Outcomes in Obese Patients With Type 2 Diabetes 3 Years After Randomization to Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery Versus Intensive Lifestyle Management: The SLIMM-T2D Study.,"To compare the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery versus intensive medical diabetes and weight management (IMWM) on clinical and patient-reported outcomes in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. We prospectively randomized 38 obese patients with type 2 diabetes (15 male and 23 female, with mean Â± SD weight 104 Â± 16 kg, BMI 36.3 Â± 3.4 kg/m2, age 52 Â± 6 years, and HbA1c 8.5 Â± 1.3% [69 Â± 14 mmol/mol]) to laparoscopic RYGB (n = 19) or IMWM (n = 19). Changes in weight, HbA1c, cardiovascular risk factors (UKPDS risk engine), and self-reported health status (the 36-Item Short-Form [SF-36] survey, Impact of Weight on Quality of Life [IWQOL] instrument, and Problem Areas in Diabetes Survey [PAID]) were assessed. After 3 years, the RYGB group had greater weight loss (mean -24.9 kg [95% CI -29.5, -20.4] vs. -5.2 [-10.3, -0.2]; P < 0.001) and lowering of HbA1c (-1.79% [-2.38, -1.20] vs. -0.39% [-1.06, 0.28] [-19.6 mmol/mol {95% CI -26.0, -13.1} vs. -4.3 {-11.6, 3.1}]; P < 0.001) compared with the IMWM group. Changes in cardiometabolic risk for coronary heart disease and stroke were all more favorable in RYGB versus IMWM (P < 0.05 to P < 0.01). IWQOL improved more after RYGB (P < 0.001), primarily due to subscales of physical function, self-esteem, and work performance. SF-36 and PAID scores improved in both groups, with no difference between treatments. A structural equation model demonstrated that improvement in overall quality of life was more strongly associated with weight loss than with improved HbA1c and was manifest by greater improvements in IWQOL than with either SF-36 or PAID. Three years after randomization to RYGB versus IMWM, surgery produced greater weight loss, lower HbA1c, reduced cardiovascular risk, and improvements in obesity-related quality of life in obese patients with type 2 diabetes.",10.2337/dc17-0487,,,,426
529,Metabolic surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes: A network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"To compare different types of metabolic surgery (MS) with medical therapy (MT) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We conducted a network-meta-analysis (NMA) including randomized clinical trials comparing different MS techniques versus MT in people with T2D, with a duration of â‰¥24â€‰weeks. Primary endpoints were glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and diabetes remission. Indirect comparisons of different types of surgery were performed by NMA. Mean and 95% confidence intervals for continuous variables, and Mantel-Haenzel odds ratios for categorial variables, were calculated using random effect models. Types of MS included: laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy (SG), bilio-pancreatic diversion (BPD); greater curvature plication (GCP); one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB); and duodenojejunal bypass. The 24 retrieved trials included 1351 patients (1014 with MS and 337 with MT). The mean baseline BMI was 36.8 kg/m2 . MS was associated with significantly greater reductions in HbA1c and FPG and greater diabetes remission when compared to MT. In the NMA, a significant reduction in HbA1c was observed with OAGB and SG. All surgical procedures were associated with a significant increase in diabetes remission, except GCP and LAGB. All procedures were associated with a reduction of body mass index (BMI). Metabolic surgery is an interesting option for the treatment of T2D, although further data are needed to demonstrate its long-term efficacy and safety. Present data are not sufficient to modify current recommendations, which consider MS a possible treatment for T2D in those with a BMI >35â€‰kg/m2 .",10.1111/dom.14045,,,,427
433,"Revision procedures after initial Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, treatment of weight regain: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","Morbid obesity is a global chronic disease, and bariatric procedures have been approved as the best method to control obesity. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is one of the most common bariatric surgeries in the world and has become the gold standard procedure for many years. However, some patients experience weight regain or weight loss failure after the initial bypass surgery and require revisional or conversional interventions. International databases including PubMed, International Scientific Indexing (ISI), and Scopus were considered for a systematic search of articles that were published by 5th of May 2020. Forty-one published studies, which reported revision procedure on 1403 patients, were selected and analyzed for this review. The selected studies were categorized into six groups of revision procedures, including laparoscopic pouch resizing and/or revision of gastro-jejunal anastomosis (GJA), adjustable or non-adjustable gastric band over pouch Â± pouch/GJA resizing, endoscopic revision of gastric GJA Â± pouch, distal Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (DRGB), biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) or single anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with gastric sleeve (SADI-S), DRGB + Band or pouch/GJA resizing. Revision procedures result in more weight loss after the initial weight loss procedures. In the one-year follow-up, DRGB by itself with standardized mean difference (SMD) of â€‰-â€‰1.24 presented a greater decrease in body mass index (BMI). DRGB plus band or pouch/GJA resizing, BPD-DS or SADI, adjustable or non-adjustable gastric banding over pouch Â± pouch/GJA resizing, endoscopic pouch and/or GJA revision and laparoscopic pouch or/and GJA resizing revealed a lower decrease in BMI in order, respectively. In the three-year follow-up, BPD-DS or SADI-S method with SMD of â€‰-â€‰1.40 presented the highest decrease in BMI. In follow, DRGB alone, adjustable or non-adjustable gastric banding over gastric pouch Â± pouch / GJA resizing, DRGB + Band or gastric pouch/GJA resizing, laparoscopic pouch and/or GJA resizing and endoscopic revision of pouch and/or GJA revealed less reduction in BMI, respectively. In the five-year follow-up, DRGB alone procedures with SMD of â€‰-â€‰2.17 presented the greatest reduction in BMI. Subsequently, BPD-DS or SADI-S, laparoscopic pouch and/or GJA size revision, and endoscopic revision of GJA/pouch revealed less overall decrease in BMI in order. All methods of revision procedures after the initial RYGB have been effective in the resolution of weight regain. However, based on the findings in this systematic review, it seems DRGB or BPD-DS/SADI-S is the most effective procedure in the long-term follow-up outcome. More studies with a higher number of patients and even longer follow-ups will be required to obtain more accurate data and outcome.",10.1007/s13304-020-00961-w,,,,428
1639,Gastric surgery for pseudotumor cerebri associated with severe obesity.,"To study the efficacy of gastric surgery-induced weight loss for the treatment of pseudotumor cerebri (PTC). Pseudotumor cerebri (also called idiopathic intracranial hypertension), a known complication of severe obesity, is associated with severe headaches, pulsatile tinnitus, elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressures, and normal brain imaging. The authors have found in previous clinical and animal studies that PTC in obese persons is probably secondary to a chronic increase in intraabdominal pressure leading to increased intrathoracic pressure. CSF-peritoneal shunts have a high failure rate, probably because they involve shunting from a high-pressure system to another high-pressure zone. In an earlier study of gastric bypass surgery in eight patients, CSF pressure decreased from 353+/-35 to 168+/-12 mm H2O at 34+/-8 months after surgery, with resolution of headaches in all. Twenty-four severely obese women underwent bariatric surgery--23 gastric bypasses and one laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding--62+/-52 months ago for the control of severe obesity associated with PTC. CSF pressures were 324+/-83 mm H2O. Additional PTC central nervous system and cranial nerve problems included peripheral visual field loss, trigeminal neuralgia, recurrent Bell's palsy, and pulsatile tinnitus. Spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea occurred in one patient, and hemiplegia with homonymous hemianopsia developed as a complication of ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement in another. There were two occluded lumboperitoneal shunts and another functional but ineffective lumboperitoneal shunt. Additional obesity comorbidity in these patients included degenerative joint disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypertension, urinary stress incontinence, sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation, and type II diabetes mellitus. At 1 year after bariatric surgery, 19 patients lost an average of 45+/-12 kg, which was 71+/-18% of their excess weight. Their body mass index and percentage of ideal body weight had fallen to 30+/-5 kg/m2 and 133+/-22%, respectively. In four patients, less than 1 year had elapsed since surgery. Five patients were lost to follow-up. Surgically induced weight loss was associated with resolution of headache and pulsatile tinnitus in all but one patient within 4 months of the procedure. The cranial nerve dysfunctions resolved in all patients. The patient with CSF rhinorrhea had resolution within 4 weeks of gastric bypass. Of the 19 patients not lost to follow-up, 2 regained weight, with recurrence of headache and pulsatile tinnitus. Additional resolved associated comorbidities were 6/14 degenerative joint disease, 9/10 gastroesophageal reflux disorder, 2/6 hypertension, and all with sleep apnea, hypoventilation, type II diabetes mellitus, and urinary incontinence. Bariatric surgery is the long-term procedure of choice for severely obese patients with PTC and is shown to have a much higher rate of success than CSF-peritoneal shunting reported in the literature, as well as providing resolution of additional obesity comorbidity. Increased intraabdominal pressure associated with central obesity is the probable etiology of PTC, a condition that should no longer be considered idiopathic.",10.1097/00000658-199905000-00005,,,,429
1390,Laparoscopy-assisted subtotal gastrectomy with very small remnant stomach: a novel surgical procedure for selected early gastric cancer in the upper stomach.,"Total gastrectomy or proximal gastrectomy is usually performed either as an open procedure or laparoscopically for the treatment of early gastric cancer (EGC) in the upper stomach. However, quality of life after either total or proximal gastrectomy is not so satisfactory. The authors report a novel surgical procedure, laparoscopy-assisted subtotal gastrectomy (LAsTG), by which a very small remnant stomach is preserved, for the surgery of selected EGCs in the upper stomach. Twenty-three patients with EGC in the upper stomach underwent LAsTG. After lymph node dissection and mobilization of the stomach, the stomach was transected about 2 cm proximal to the tumor and a very small remnant stomach was preserved. An anvil was inserted transorally into the remnant stomach by using the OrVil system. The reconstruction method was Roux-en-Y, and hemidouble-stapling gastrojejunostomy with a circular stapler was performed intracorporeally. There were no intraoperative complications or conversions to open surgery. Mean operation time and blood loss were 266.7 min and 54.6 ml, respectively. The overall incidence of early postoperative complications was 17.4%, and two patients underwent reoperation because of duodenal stump leakage and stenosis of the Y-anastomosis, respectively. During the follow-up period, two patients experienced gastrojejunostomy stenosis and both were treated successfully by endoscopic balloon dilation. LAsTG may be performed in selected patients with EGC in the upper stomach. With the described method, a very small remnant stomach can be preserved.",10.1007/s10120-011-0023-7,,,,430
1597,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, but not rebanding, should be proposed as rescue procedure for patients with failed laparoscopic gastric banding.","To define whether laparoscopic rebanding or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass represents the best approach for failed laparoscopic gastric banding in patients with morbid obesity. Countless laparoscopic gastric bandings have been implanted during the recent years worldwide. Despite excellent short-term results, long-term failures and complications have been reported in more than 20% of patients. Which rescue procedures should be used remains controversial. Therefore, we analyzed our experience with the use of laparoscopic rebanding versus laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass after failed gastric banding. Using a prospectively collected database, we analyzed the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of laparoscopic rebanding versus laparoscopic conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass after failed laparoscopic gastric banding. RESULTS A total of 62 consecutive patients were treated in our institution between May 1995 and December 2002 for failed primary laparoscopic gastric banding, including 30 laparoscopic rebandings and 32 laparoscopic conversions to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Rebandings were preferably done during the initial period of the study and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in the last period. Both groups were comparable before the initial banding procedures. At the time of redo surgery, patients receiving a gastric bypass had more esophageal dysmotility (47% vs. 7%, P = 0.002) and higher body mass index (BMI) than those elected for rebanding procedures (BMI 42.0 vs. 38.4 kg/m2, P = 0.015). Feasibility and safety: Each procedure was performed laparoscopically. Mean operating time was 215 minutes for gastric bypass and 173 minutes for rebanding (P = 0.03). Early complications occurred in one case in the rebanding group and in 2 cases in the bypass group; all underwent a laparoscopic reexploration without the need for open surgery. There was no mortality in this series. Effectiveness: BMI in the gastric bypass group decreased from 42.0 to 31.8 kg/m2 (P = 0.02) within 1 year of surgery, while it remained unchanged in the rebanding group. Laparoscopic conversion to a gastric bypass as well as laparoscopic rebanding are feasible and safe. Conversion to gastric bypass offers a significant advantage in terms of further weight loss after surgery. Therefore, this procedure should be considered as the rescue therapy of choice after a failed laparoscopic gastric banding.",10.1097/01.sla.0000098623.53293.bb,,,,431
482,"The Metabolic Effects of Pre-probiotic Supplementation After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) Surgery: a Prospective, Randomized Controlled Study.","Following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), positive alterations are observed in gut microbiota and intestinal peptides. Previous studies demonstrated similar alterations observed in cases when pre-probiotics are used without surgery. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of early use of pre-probiotics after RYGB. The operation and follow-up of the patients were performed at Istanbul University Medical Faculty. Thirty-two patients who had undergone RYGB were randomized to pre-probiotic group (PreProBG, nâ€‰=â€‰16; 200Â g/day yogurt plus 10Â g/day inulin+oligofructose) and probiotic group (ProBG, nâ€‰=â€‰16; 200Â g/day yogurt only) for 6Â months. Blood samples (glucose, insulin, A1c, GLP-1, PYY), anthropometric measurements, and appetite ratings have been evaluated at baseline and 3 (m3) and 6 (m6) months after RYGB. Initial anthropometric measurements and appetite ratings decreased significantly after surgery and there were no significant differences between the groups. The decrease of area under the curve(insulin) was less and has a positive correlation with the changes in anthropometric measurements in PreProBG. GLP-1 and PYY which increased dramatically after surgery in all patients were higher in PreProBG. But this increase had a negative correlation with the changes in anthropometric measurements during the study. Increased insulin, GLP-1, and PYY secretion was more enhanced by pre-probiotic use in early postoperative period. But this increase not only in anthropometric measurements but also in appetite ratings affects negatively, contrary to expectations. In summary, it should be investigated with new studies that use of pre-probiotics in the late postoperative period may be more effective in patients with weak insulin and incretin response and therefore insufficient weight loss.

392,"The influence of preoperative carbohydrate loading on postoperative outcomes in bariatric surgery patients: a randomized, controlled trial.","Preoperative carbohydrate loading is a component of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols, but there is limited literature in bariatric surgery patients. The objective of this study was to characterize the impact of preoperative carbohydrate loading on postoperative bariatric surgery outcomes. University Hospital. Patients undergoing a primary minimally invasive Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) between 2018 and 2020 were randomized to standard management or intervention. Standard management patients were nothing by mouth (NPO) after midnight prior to surgery. Intervention patients consumed 2 carbohydrate drinks: 1 the night before and another 3 hours prior to surgery. Primary outcomes analyzed included postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), length of stay, and overall complications. In total, 134 patients were analyzed: 64 intervention (47.8%) and 70 (52.2%) standard. In the end, 7% and 15% of patients were lost to follow-up at 6-weeks and 3-months, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in length of stay (2.0 Â± 1.2 vs 2.1 Â± .9 d; P = .65) or postoperative outcomes between the 2 groups. There were no episodes of aspiration among the intervention group. Among RYGB patients, intervention patients had a shorter duration of nausea compared with standard patients. There was no significant difference in glycemic control among patients with and without diabetes. Preoperative carbohydrate drinks can be administered to bariatric surgery patients without significant risks. Carbohydrate loading preoperatively can decrease the duration of PONV in RYGB patients. Carbohydrate drinks can be safely included in bariatric ERAS protocols for patients with and without diabetes, although the benefits remain unknown.",10.1016/j.soard.2021.04.014,,,,433
475,Barbed versus conventional thread used in laparoscopic gastric bypass: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Hand-sewn gastrointestinal anastomosis during laparoscopic gastric bypass (GBP) could be performed using the conventional multifilament suture (CS) or a barbed suture (BS). This systematic review with meta-analysis aimed to assess the advantages and disadvantages of these two anastomosis alternatives. Bibliographic search for relevant studies was performed, according to the PRISMA guidelines, to perform the systematic review with meta-analysis. RevMan was applied to analyze the data using the random effects size. Eight studies were eligible for analysis including 26,340 patients. These patients underwent a single gastric bypass or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. According to the available data from this systematic review with meta-analysis, BS in GBP ensures similar morbidity rate (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.31, p = 0.74) with shorter operative time (MD = - 7.90, 95% CI: - 12.95 to - 2.84, p = 0.002). BS is similar to CS in terms of anastomotic leak (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 0.90 to 1.73, p = 0.19), stricture (OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.32 to 2.44, p = 0.82), bleeding (OR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.20 to 1.86, p = 0.39), and hospital stay (MD: 0.04, 95% CI: - 0.28 to 1.86, p = 0.81). On the other way, BS is cheaper than CS. The majority of studies were retrospectives. One study included the large majority of retained patients; thus then, this comparison should be interpreted with caution. BS and CS in gastrointestinal anastomosis during GBP are feasible and safe. BS is faster and cheaper with similar postoperative outcomes.",10.1007/s00423-020-01979-9,,,,434
175,Chronic abdominal pain and quality of life after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy - a cross-cohort analysis of two prospective longitudinal observational studies.,"Chronic abdominal pain (CAP) after bariatric surgery is not extensively explored and may impact the postoperative outcomes. To compare the prevalence of patient-reported chronic abdominal pain (CAP) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Secondarily, we compared other abdominal and psychological symptoms and quality of life (QoL). Preoperative predictors of postoperative CAP were also explored. Tertiary referral centers for bariatric surgery in Norway. Analyses of 2 separate prospective longitudinal cohort studies evaluating CAP, abdominal and psychological symptoms and QoL before and 2 years after RYGB and SG. Follow-ups were attended by 416 patients (85.8%), 300/416 (72.1%) were females and 209/416 (50.2%) were RYGB procedures. At follow-up, the mean age was 44.9 (10.0) years, BMI 29.5 (5.4) kg/m2, and total weight loss 31.6 (10.3) %. The prevalence of CAP was 28/236 (11.9%) before and 60/209 (28.7%) after RYGB (P < .001) and 32/223 (14.3%) before and 50/186 (26.9%) after SG (P < .001). Gastrointestinal symptom rating scale scores showed greater deterioration of diarrhea and indigestion after RYGB and reflux after SG. The improvement in depression symptoms was greater after SG, as well as several QoL scores improved more after SG. Patients with CAP after RYGB experienced deterioration in several QoL scores, while these scores improved in patients with CAP after SG. Preoperative hypertension, bothersome reflux symptoms, and CAP predicted postoperative CAP. The prevalence of CAP increased comparably after RYGB and SG, with worsening of gastroesophageal reflux after SG and greater deterioration of diarrhea and indigestion after RYGB. In patients with CAP at follow-up, several QoL scores improved more after SG than RYGB.",10.1016/j.soard.2023.01.020,,,,435
1373,"Human experience with an endoluminal, endoscopic, gastrojejunal bypass sleeve.","This report describes the authors' experience with a unique endoluminal, endoscopically delivered and retrieved gastroduodenojejunal bypass sleeve, including short-term weight loss and changes in comorbidities. A prospective, single-center trial was designed. The patients were morbidly obese individuals who met the National Institutes of Health criteria for bariatric surgery. The device used was a unique gastroduodenojejunal bypass sleeve secured at the esophagogastric junction with endoscopic and laparoscopic techniques and designed to create an endoluminal gastroduodenojejunal bypass. At completion of the trial, the device was explanted with endoscopic retrieval. The primary end points were safety and incidence of adverse events. The secondary outcomes included the percentage of excess weight loss and changes in comorbidities, specifically glucose control, use of antihyperglycemic medications, and changes in hemoglobin A1c levels. From July 2008 to February 2010, 24 patients were enrolled in the trial. The gastroduodenojejunal bypass sleeve was implanted, left in situ, and then retrieved. The 7 men and 17 women in the study had a mean preoperative body mass index of 42Â kg/m(2). The device was successfully delivered in 22 of the 24 patients (92%) and retrieved endoscopically from all 22 patients in whom it was implanted (100%). Two patients were excluded from the study preprocedurally. The one patient was excluded preoperatively due to noncompliance with the preoperative liquid diet. For the other excluded patient, the device was not attempted endoscopically due to significant inflammation at the gastroesophageal junction at the time of laparoscopic evaluation. Of the 22 patients who had the device implanted, 17 maintained it (77%) and completed the full 12-week trial. These patients had 39.7% excess weight loss at completion of the study. The primary reason for early explantation of the device was early postoperative dysphagia. The seven patients with preoperative diabetes mellitus all had normal blood glucose levels throughout the trial, and none required antihyperglycemic medications. All four patients with elevated hemoglobin A1c levels preoperatively showed improvement by the end of the trial. This trial demonstrated that the endoluminal gastroduodenojejunal sleeve can achieve excellent weight loss at 12Â weeks. No patient safety issues were encountered. Adverse effects were minimal and resolved at endoscopic device removal. Effective glycemic control was demonstrated through use of the device during the trial. Long-term results are needed.",10.1007/s00464-011-1665-6,,,,436
785,Supervised Physical Training Improves Weight Loss After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Bariatric surgery results in significant weight loss and reduces cardiovascular morbidity. However, a large variation in postsurgery weight loss is seen. Physical activity promotes weight loss in nonsurgically treated subjects with obesity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 6 months of supervised physical training following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) on body weight and cardiovascular risk markers. Sixty participants eligible for RYGB were included. Six months post surgery, the participants were randomly assigned to either twice-weekly supervised physical training sessions in a fitness center (INT) or a control group (CON) for 26 weeks. Before surgery and 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery, the participants underwent an examination program that included anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, heart rate, blood samples, and an abdominal computed tomography scan. RYGB significantly reduced body weight and improved cardiovascular risk markers (all Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01). The supervised physical training intervention resulted in a 4.2-kg (CI: -0.2 to -8.3 kg) lower body weight in INT compared with CON at the study end (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.042). The high-density lipoprotein concentration was significantly higher in INT than in CON at the termination of the intervention, but this was not maintained at the 24-months examination.

The Alliance of Randomized Trials of Medicine vs Metabolic Surgery in Type 2 Diabetes (ARMMS-T2D) is a consortium of four randomized trials designed to compare long-term efficacy and safety of surgery versus medical/lifestyle therapy on diabetes control and clinical outcomes. Patients with T2D and body mass index (BMI) of 27-45â€‰kg/m2 who were previously randomized to metabolic surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, adjustable gastric band, or sleeve gastrectomy) versus medical/lifestyle intervention in the STAMPEDE, SLIMM-T2D, TRIABETES, or CROSSROADS trials have been enrolled in ARMMS-T2D for observational follow-up. The primary outcome is change in glycated haemoglobin after a minimum 7â€‰years of follow-up, with additional analyses to determine rates of diabetes remission and relapse, as well as cardiovascular and renal endpoints. In total, 302 patients (192 surgical, 110 medical/lifestyle) previously randomized in the four parent studies were eligible for participation in the ARMMS-T2D observational study. Participant demographics were 71% white, 27% African-American and 68% female.

1200,Banded Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for the treatment of morbid obesity.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is the most effective treatment for morbid obesity. The additional benefit of placing a nonadjustable band around the pouch remains to be determined. The objective of this study was to compare outcomes between banded and nonbanded LRYGB patients in a single bariatric center. A matched cohort analysis was performed between patients who had undergone banded and nonbanded (standard) LRYGB. In the banded bypass cohort, an 8 F, 6.5 cm silastic ring was placed around the proximal gastric pouch. Both cohorts were matched for age, body mass index (BMI), and anastomotic technique. Endpoints included percentage excess weight loss (%EWL), postoperative morbidity, and band-related complications. Between January 2007 and July 2010, 134 banded LRYGB were performed (55% female, mean age 45 years). They were compared with a matched cohort of 134 concurrent nonbanded LRYGB patients (67% female, mean age 45.4 years). Mean preoperative BMI was 54.6 and 52.8 kg/m(2), respectively (P = .084). At 24 months postoperatively, the average %EWL was 58.6% in banded bypass patients and 51.4% in the nonbanded group (P = .015). The difference in EWL was more pronounced in super-obese patients than in those with BMI<50 (among super-obese, 57.5% versus 47.6%, P = .003; among those with BMI<50, 62.9% versus 57.9%, P = .406]. There was no difference in early (19.4% versus 19.4%) or late complications (10.4% versus 13.4%, P = .451) between banded and nonbanded LRYGB patients. Banding the pouch during LRYGB can be performed safely and may provide better weight loss, particularly in super-obese patients. Further prospective and long-term comparative studies of this technique are warranted.",10.1016/j.soard.2013.10.016,,,,439
1025,"Comparison of Preoperative Diets Before Bariatric Surgery: a Randomized, Single-Blinded, Non-inferiority Trial.","In order to increase weight loss and minimize complications, a preoperative diet before bariatric has been advocated. However, some diets are poorly tolerated by patients and this can lead to low compliance and too little weight loss. In this study, we aim to compare two preoperative diets in order to find the most suitable for this patient population. Comparison of preoperative diets before bariatric surgery with a randomized non-inferiority trial in order to compare the standard very low calorie diet (VLCD) by protein shakes (Prodimed) with a standard diet using ordinary products. The primary outcome parameter was preoperative weight loss. Secondary outcome parameters were operation time, difficulty of surgery, short-term complications, short-term weight loss and compliance, tolerance, and acceptance of the diets. Two hundred twelve patients suitable for gastric bypass surgery were included and randomized. The Prodimed group contained 105 patients, the standard diet group 107 patients. Preoperative weight loss and 4Â weeks after the procedure were not significantly different between the two diet groups. Operation time, difficulty of surgery, short-term complications, and short-term weight loss were also comparable without significant differences between the diet groups. However, most of the parameters measuring patients' compliance, tolerance, and acceptance of the diets were significantly better in the standard diet group as compared to the patients in the Prodimed group. Protein shakes and standard diets are capable of achieving good and comparable results on preoperative weight loss before bariatric surgery. However, patients' compliance, tolerance, and acceptance were all significantly better after a standard diet. We recommend giving patients a choice in preoperative diets in order to achieve the best possible weight loss and results.",10.1007/s11695-015-1989-8,,,,440
680,A randomized control trial using intraoperative dexmedetomidine during Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery to reduce postoperative pain and narcotic use.,"Dexmedetomidine (DMET), a selective a2-adrenergic agonist, is an opioid-sparing adjuvant sedative that avoids respiratory depression and has been shown to be beneficial in bariatric surgery patients. Although benefit has been shown, prior studies have not evaluated the pain control effects of a single intraoperative bolus. To evaluate the postoperative effects of a single intraoperative dose of DMET. University Hospital, United States. This is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study registered with clinicaltrials.gov (#NCT02604940). Patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery were randomized and given either a placebo or an intraoperative DMET bolus, where 1 mg/kg was delivered over 10 minutes at the time of surgical closure. Measured outcomes included the following: postoperative pain scores, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) opioid consumption, PCA demand bolus attempts, duration of postanesthesia care unit (PACU) stay, and vital signs. Descriptive statistics were recorded as frequencies and compared using Î§2 analysis, and a Welch's 2-sample t test was used to compare continuous variables. Forty-six participants undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery were randomized into placebo (nâ€¯=â€¯20) or DMET (nâ€¯=â€¯26) groups. There were no statistical differences in age (45.1 versus 43.2 yr, Pâ€¯=â€¯.522), sex (80% versus 81% female, Pâ€¯=â€¯.948), and body mass index (46.1 versus 45.6 kg/m2, Pâ€¯=â€¯.818) between the 2 groups. There were no statistically significant differences in vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and respiration rate) between DMET and placebo groups in the preoperative and intraoperative period. During the initial 4 hours in the PACU postoperatively, mean heart rate (70 Â± 12 versus 86 Â± 14, P < .001), systolic blood pressure (107 Â± 17 versus 148 Â± 16, P < .001), and diastolic blood pressure (56 Â± 15 versus 79 Â± 13, P < .001) were significantly lower in the DMET-treated group compared with placebo. During the initial 4 hours in the PACU, mean self-reported pain scores were significantly lower in the DMET-treated group (3.6 Â± 2.8) compared with the placebo group (6.7 Â± 3; Pâ€¯=â€¯.005). The lower pain scores occurred with no significant difference in the mean opioid dosage received in the PACU between DMET-treated (2.66 Â± 2.02 mg) and placebo (3.7 Â± 2.3 mg; Pâ€¯=â€¯.09) groups. Also, there was no statistically significant difference in the total number of PCA attempts for opioids between the DMET-treated and placebo groups (Pâ€¯=â€¯.49). A single bolus of DMET (1 mg/kg delivered over 10 min) administered at the time of surgical closure did not reduce immediate PACU usage of opioids but significantly reduced reported pain scores and caused a significant decrease in the number of attempts made by patients; this is a trend of decreased attempts over time (Pâ€¯=â€¯.04) in the DMET group. The trend of the mean total medication used over time indicates that there is neither an increasing nor decreasing trend for the DMET group, but there is an increasing trend in the total used over time for the placebo group. There was no statistically or clinically significant bradycardia, hypotension, hypoxia, respiratory depression intraoperative duration, or PACU stay. Reduced single bolus dosing of DMET required for analgesia in bariatric surgery patients is optimal from physiologic, level of care, and cost perspectives.",10.1016/j.soard.2019.01.021,,,,441
1312,Comprehensive nutrition and lifestyle education improves weight loss and physical activity in Hispanic Americans following gastric bypass surgery: a randomized controlled trial.,"As morbid obesity increasingly affects Hispanic Americans, the incidence of bariatric procedures among this population is rising. Despite this, prospective research on the effects of comprehensive postoperative education-centered interventions on weight loss and physical activity focused on Hispanic Americans is lacking. To examine whether a comprehensive nutrition education and behavior modification intervention improves weight loss and physical activity in Hispanic Americans with obesity following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB). A prospective randomized-controlled trial was conducted between November 2008 and April 2010. At 6 months following RYGB, 144 Hispanic Americans with obesity were randomly assigned to a comprehensive nutrition and lifestyle educational intervention (n=72) or a noncomprehensive approach (comparison group n=72). Those in the comprehensive group received education sessions every other week for 6 weeks in small groups and frequent contact with a registered dietitian. Those in the comparison group received brief, printed healthy lifestyle guidelines. Patients were reassessed at 12 months following surgery. Main outcome measures were excess weight loss and physical activity changes over time. Statistical analyses used t test, ?(2) test, Wilcoxon signed rank, Mann-Whitney U test, and intent-to-treat analysis, significance P<0.05. Participants (mean age 44.5 Â± 13.5 years) were mainly Cuban-born women (83.3%). Mean preoperative excess weight and body mass index (calculated as kg/m(2)) were 72.20 Â± 27.81 kg and 49.26 Â± 9.06, respectively. At 12 months following surgery, both groups lost weight significantly, but comprehensive group participants experienced greater excess weight loss (80% vs 64% from preoperative excess weight; P<0.001) and greater body mass index reduction (6.48 Â± 4.37 vs 3.63 Â± 3.41; P<0.001) than comparison group participants. Comprehensive group participants were significantly more involved in physical activity (+14 min/wk vs ?4 min/wk; P<0.001) than comparison group participants. Mean protein intake was significantly lower in the comparison group than that in the comprehensive group (P<0.024).

264,Sex difference in the safety and efficacy of bariatric procedures: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"With the prevalence of obesity alarmingly increasing, it is of primary interest to identify those factors predicting the success of anti-obesity therapeutic strategies currently adopted in clinical practice, and in particular, those of bariatric procedures showing the greatest success in terms of weight loss and maintenance in both the short and long term. Given sex-related differences in psychosocial status, hormonal homeostasis, and body fat distribution, it is likely that the response to different weight management strategies differs by sex. The objective was to elucidate the effect of sex on different bariatric procedures' efficacy and safety outcomes. Searches of PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases were performed, followed by hand-searching of reference lists from all relevant articles. We included all the studies evaluating the effect of bariatric procedures on body mass index loss (BMIL), and/or percentage excess weight loss (%EWL), and/or percentage excess body mass index loss, and/or percentage of responders, and/or short-/long-term complications and co-morbidity resolution, broken down by sex. Twenty-seven studies with a total of 114,919 patients were included. Men were more likely to achieve greater BMIL, consistent with higher male baseline BMI, and women were 2.87 times more likely to be classified as weight responders (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.90-4.34), as well as to perform better in terms of %EWL (95% CI: .13-.54). Upon subgroup analysis based on bariatric procedure, women were more likely to be successful in terms of %EWL upon bioenteric intragastric balloon (BIB) placement (.72, 95% CI: .42-1.02). There was no sex difference regarding investigated co-morbidity resolution (hypertension, diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome) or occurrence of short-term complications, whereas women were more likely to develop long-term complications, with an odds ratio of 1.97 (95% CI: 1.57-2.49). Sex does not have a clear effect on efficacy outcomes of bariatric procedures. Differentiating by procedure, BIB may be more effective in women, although results are discordant based on the weight loss outcome considered. If the short-term postoperative complication rate is similar across both sexes, long-term complications occur more frequently in women. To clarify the real effect of sex on bariatric procedure-derived health benefits, it is crucial to report sex-stratified results in future studies, as well as evaluate body composition changes that go beyond simple body weight reduction.",10.1016/j.soard.2022.03.022,,,,443
1139,"A prospective, randomized, multicenter trial of Surgisis Gold, a biologic prosthetic, as a sublay reinforcement of the fascial closure after open bariatric surgery.","This prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial was performed to compare the effectiveness of the bioprosthesis Surgisis Gold (Cook Biotech, Inc, West Lafayette, IN) to suture closure alone in reinforcing the abdominal wall after open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). A total of 402 adult patients (body mass index â‰¥35Â kg/m(2)) scheduled to undergo open RYGB procedures were randomized to receive either Surgisis Gold placed as a sublay directly under and opposed to the posterior rectus fascia without intervening preperitoneal fat or suture closure alone. Peri- and postoperative complications were tracked. Incisional hernia formation in each group was examined at 6Â weeks, 3, 6, and 9Â months, and 1 and 2Â years after RYGB. A total of 380 (78 male; 302 female) patients with a mean age of 45Â years (range 18-69) and a mean BMI of 48 (range 35-79) underwent RYGB. There were no differences in patient demographics or comorbidities between groups. Placement of the Surgisis Gold increased operating time by an average of 14Â minutes. Complications were more common in the Surgisis Gold group with significantly more wound events and seroma formation compared with the suture closure alone group. At final follow-up, 32 of 185 (17%) of patients in the reinforced arm and 38 of 195 (20%) in the suture alone arm developed an incisional hernia (PÂ =Â .6). In this challenging patient population, the use of Surgisis Gold for reinforcing the abdominal wall after open RYGB was not shown to be greatly different from a primary suture repair.",10.1016/j.surg.2014.06.022,,,,444
1118,Weight loss and metabolic outcomes of bariatric surgery in men versus women - A matched comparative observational cohort study.,"Despite the high prevalence of morbid obesity, the global frequency of bariatric surgery in men is significantly lower than in women. It is unclear if this is due to the perception of poorer outcomes in men. Compare weight loss and metabolic outcomes in men vs. women after bariatric surgery. University teaching hospital in North West England. We performed an observational cohort analysis of 79 men matched to 79 women for baseline age (Â± 5 years), body mass index (BMI; Â± 2 kg/m(2)), bariatric procedure (69 gastric bypass and 10 sleeve gastrectomy each), type 2 diabetes (33 each), and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA; 40 each). Overall mean (95% confidence interval) reduction in BMI was 17.5 (15.7-19.4) kg/m(2) (P<0.001) at 24 months. There was no significant difference between men and women in mean percentage excess BMI loss (65.8% vs. 72.9%) at 24 months. Likewise, there were significant reductions in blood pressure, glycosylated haemoglobin and total cholesterol-to-high density lipoprotein cholesterol overall but no significant gender differences. Postoperatively, 77.5% of men and 90.0% of women with OSA discontinued CPAP therapy (non-significant). Weight loss and metabolic outcomes after bariatric surgery are of similar magnitude in men compared to women. The use of bariatric surgery in eligible men should be encouraged.",10.1016/j.ejim.2014.10.020,,,,445
190,Long-Term Outcomes of Iron Deficiency Before and After Bariatric Surgery: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"This study reviews the prevalence of iron deficiency (ID) in bariatric surgery candidates and the long-term outcomes of the prevalence of ID after bariatric surgery. A systematic literature search and meta-analysis were performed in PubMed for articles published by August 31, 2022, including these search terms: bariatric surgery, metabolic surgery, weight loss surgery, obesity surgery, sleeve gastrectomy, gastric banding, gastric bypass, duodenal switch, duodenojejunal bypass, iron, iron deficiency, sideropenia, and hypoferritinemia. Fifty-seven studies examining a total of 26,328 patients with morbidly obese were included in this meta-analysis finally. The results showed a prevalence of 17% of ID in bariatric surgery candidates and a prevalence of 14%, 17%, 26%, 34%, 23%, 38%, and 23% of ID at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 8-, and 10-year follow-up after bariatric surgery, respectively. Additionally, the results showed a prevalence of 15%, 19%, 35%, 38%, 29%, 30%, and 23% of ID at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 8-, and 10-year follow-up after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, respectively; a prevalence of 12%, 12%, 15%, 31%, and 17% of ID at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year follow-up after sleeve gastrectomy, respectively; and a prevalence of 19% of ID at 1-year follow-up after anastomosis gastric bypass. As a result, preoperative evaluation and correction of ID may lead to better outcomes for bariatric surgery candidates. ID is also common in patients after bariatric procedures, especially RYGB. Long-term, even lifelong, medical and nutritional monitoring and tailored interventions are critical.",10.1007/s11695-023-06465-x,,,,446
959,A short or a long Roux limb in gastric bypass surgery: does it matter?,"The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) still remains the gold standard in bariatric surgery. However, no consensus exists on the optimal limb lengths to induce maximum weight reduction. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of a longer alimentary limb (AL) length on weight reduction after RYGB. A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of patients who underwent a primary laparoscopic RYGB between January 2001 and March 2011 was performed. Patients received a short AL (SAL; 100Â cm) or a long AL (LAL; 150Â cm). Primary outcome was weight loss, and secondary outcomes were short- and long-term complication rates. A total of 768 patients received a RYGB during the study period. Of these, 730 consecutive patients were included for long-term analysis and had a mean follow-up (FU) of 37Â Â±Â 26 [range 0-120] months; 360 (47Â %) patients received a SAL RYGB. Overall %TBWL was 33Â Â±Â 9Â % after 2Â years (FU 74Â %) and 28Â Â±Â 12Â % after 5Â years (FU 20Â %). No significant differences in %TBWL were found between SAL RYGB and LAL RYGB during the study period. The 30-day mortality rate was 0.13, 9Â % overall short-term complication rate and 19Â % cumulative long-term complication rate. No differences in complications were found between SAL and LAL RYGB patients. Lengthening of the alimentary limb from 100 to 150Â cm did not affect post-RYGB weight loss. Overall complication rates were low and comparable in this series of RYGB patients.",10.1007/s00464-016-5188-z,,,,447
1271,"Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: 10-year results of a prospective, randomized trial.","There are few studies of long-term outcomes for either laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). The objective of this study was to compare outcomes of patients randomly assigned to undergo LAGB or LRYGB at 10 years. LAGB, using the pars flaccida technique, and standard LRYGB were performed. From January 2000 to November 2000, 51 patients (mean age 34.0 Â± 8.9 years; range 20-49) were randomly allocated to undergo either LAGB (n = 27, 5 men and 22 women; mean age 33.3 years; mean weight 120 kg; mean body mass index [BMI] 43.4 kg/m(2)) or LRYGB (n = 24, 4 men and 20 women; mean age 34.7; mean weight 120 kg; mean BMI 43.8 kg/m(2)). Data on complications, reoperations, weight, BMI, percentage of excess weight loss, and co-morbidities were collected yearly. The data were analyzed using Student's t test and Fisher's exact test, with P<.05 considered significant. Five patients in the LAGB group and 3 patients in the LRYGB group were lost to follow-up. No patient died. Conversion to laparotomy was performed in 1 (4.2%) of 24 LRYGB patients. Reoperations were required in 9 (40.9%) of 22 LAGB patients and in 6 (28.6%) of the 21 LRYGB patients. At 10-year follow-up, the LRYGB patients had a greater percentage of mean excess weight loss than did the LAGB patients (69Â±29% versus 46Â±27%; P = .03). LRYGB was superior to LAGB in term of excess weight loss results (76.2% versus 46.2%) at 10 years. However, LRYGB exposes patients to higher early complication rates than LAGB (8.3% versus 0%) and potentially lethal long-term surgical complications (internal hernia and bowel obstruction rate: 4.7%).",10.1016/j.soard.2012.11.011,,,,448
1240,Long-term outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy for early gastric cancer: result of a randomized controlled trial (COACT 0301).,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) compared to open distal gastrectomy (ODG) in the treatment of early gastric cancer with respect to survival, surgical outcomes, complications, and quality of life (QOL). One hundred sixty-four patients with cT1N0M0 and cT1N1M0 distal gastric cancer were randomly assigned to either the LADG group or the ODG group. The primary end point was the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate. Complications were classified using the accordion severity classification of postoperative complications scheme. QOL was measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and QLQ-STO22 preoperatively and postoperatively during regular follow-up visits. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00546468). The median (range) follow-up period was 74.3 (24.8-90.8) months. The LADG and ODG groups showed similar survival [5-year DFS rate: 98.8 % vs. 97.6 %, respectively (P = 0.514), 5-year overall survival (OS) rate: 97.6 vs. 96.3 %, respectively (P = 0.721)] or overall complication rate (29.3 vs. 42.7 %, respectively; P = 0.073). Mild complications were significantly less frequent in the LADG group than in the ODG group (23.2 vs. 41.5 %; P = 0.012). The rates of moderate, severe, and long-term complications (i.e., 31 days to 5 years after surgery) did not differ significantly between groups. No clinically meaningful differences were detected between the two groups in long-term QOL. LADG showed similar DFS and OS compared to ODG in treating early gastric cancer. Marginal benefits in mild complications were observed with LADG. LADG did not show advantages over ODG regarding other complications and long-term QOL.",10.1007/s00464-013-3037-x,,,,449
542,Three-dimensional vs two-dimensional laparoscopic gastric bypass for manual gastrojejunal anastomosis: A prospective and randomized trial.,"The objective of this study was to compare the total procedure time and task-specific execution time in gastric bypass using a three-dimensional (3D) versus two-dimensional (2D) imaging system. This study was a prospective and randomized clinical trial. Forty obese patients were randomized into two groups: gastric bypass with 3D imaging system or with conventional 2D system. The primary endpoint was operative time during manual gastrojejunal anastomosis. Data collection was carried out on demographics, comorbidities, operative time in three stages, and complications. The same surgeon performed all surgeries. Two patients were excluded because technical issues were encountered for viewing their videos during the trial. A total of 20 patients in the Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass (LGB) 3D group and 18 in the LGB 2D group were analyzed. There were no significant differences in the pre-operative data. The average procedure time was 16.5 min lower in the 3D group versus the 2D group. Execution time for specific tasks was not statistically significant, except for the gastrojejunal anastomosis, which is routinely performed as a manual anastomosis in our surgery group. There was no complication intra- or post-operative. The use of a 3D imaging system for laparoscopic gastric bypass was associated with a shorter total operative time, especially for the hand-sewn gastrojejunal anastomosis, compared with the 2D imaging system.

1655,Weight loss and dietary intake after vertical banded gastroplasty and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"The purpose of this study was to learn whether preoperative eating habits can be used to predict outcome after vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). BACKGROUND SUMMARY: Several independent randomized and sequential studies have reported significantly greater weight loss after RYGB in comparison with VBG. Although the mechanism responsible for weight loss after both procedures is restriction of intake rather than malabsorption, the relationships between calorie intake, food preferences, and postoperative weight loss are not well defined. During the past 5 years, 138 patients were prospectively selected for either VBG or RYGB, based on their preoperative eating habits. All patients were screened by a dietitian who determined total calorie intake and diet composition before recommending VBG or RYGB. Thirty patients were selected for VBG; the remaining 108 patients were classified as ""sweets eaters"" or ""snackers"" and had RYGB. Detailed recall diet histories also were performed at each postoperative visit. Early morbidity rate was zero after VBG versus 3% after RYGB. There were no deaths. Mean follow-up was 39 +/- 11 months after VBG and 38 +/- 14 months after RYGB. Mean weight loss peaked at 74 +/- 23 lb at 12 months after VBG and 99 +/- 24 lb at 16 months after RYGB (p < or = 0.001). Twelve of 30 VBG patients lost > or = 50% of their excess weight versus 100 of 108 RYGB patients (p < or = 0.0001). Milk/ice cream intake was significantly greater postoperatively in patients who underwent VBG versus patients who underwent RYGB after 6 months (p < or = 0.003), whereas solid sweets intake was significantly greater after VBG during the first 18 months postoperatively (p < or = 0.004). Revision of VBG was performed in 6 of 30 patients (20%) for complications or poor weight loss, whereas only 2 of 108 patients who underwent RYGB required surgical revisions (p < or = 0.001). These data show that VBG adversely alters postoperative eating behavior toward soft, high-calorie foods, resulting in problematic postoperative weight loss. Conversely, RYGB patients had significantly greater weight loss despite inferior preoperative eating habits. The high rate of surgical revision in conjunction with inconsistent postoperative weight loss has led us to no longer recommend VBG as treatment for morbid obesity.",10.1097/00000658-199412000-00012,,,,451
294,"Selenium Deficiency After Bariatric Surgery, Incidence and Symptoms: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","This study review the prevalence of selenium deficiency after bariatric surgery, incidence, and symptoms.Â A systematic literature search and meta-analysis was performed in PubMed and Scopus for articles published by November 1, 2021, including the keywords ""Roux-en Y gastric bypass"", ""RYGB"", ""Omega bypass"", ""Mini bypass"", ""One anastomosis gastric bypass"", ""Bariatric surgery"", ""Weight loss surgery"", ""Metabolic surgery"", ""Gastric bypass"", ""Loop gastric bypass"", ""Selenium"", ""Selenium deficiency"", or a combination of aimed tothem in the title or abstract.Â In this review, nine studies examining a total of 1174 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The mean age of the patients was 41.14â€‰Â±â€‰7.69Â years. The mean interval between bariatric surgery and selenium deficiency was 40.36â€‰Â±â€‰43.29Â months. Mean BMI before surgery and at the time of selenium deficiency was 43.68â€‰Â±â€‰4.91Â kg/m2 and 28.41â€‰Â±â€‰9.09Â kg/m2, respectively. Additionally, the results showed a prevalence of 16% and 2% of selenium deficiency at 1- and 2-year follow-up after bariatric surgery, respectively. Symptoms included weakness, myopathy, and cardiomyopathy, loss of muscle mass, erythematous desquamating eruption, lethargy, dyspnea, and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Forty percent of studies reported ""Selenium orally (100Â Î¼g once daily)"" as treatment option.Â A multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including dietitians, should be involved in the bariatric patient's care.

420,Three-year effects of bariatric surgery on obstructive sleep apnea in patients with obesity grade 1 and 2: a sub-analysis of the GATEWAY trial.,"Most of the evidence on bariatric surgery on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is based on observational studies and/or short-term follow-up in patients with obesity grade 3. This randomized study compared the effects of roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or usual care (UC) on OSA severity in patients with obesity grade 1-2. Mild, moderate, and severe OSA was defined by the apnea-hypopnoea index (AHI): 5-14.9; 15-29.9, and â‰¥30 events/h, respectively. OSA remission was defined by converting any form of OSA into normal AHI (<5 events/h). After 3-year of follow-up, the body-mass index increased in the UC while decreased in the RYGB group: +1.7 (-1.9; 2.7) versus -10.6 (-12.7; -9.2) kg/m2, respectively. The AHI increased by 5 (-4.2; 12.7) in the UC group while reduced in the RYGB group to -13.2 (-22.7; -7) events/h. UC significantly increase the frequency of moderate OSA (from 15.4 to 46.2%). In contrast, RYGB had a huge impact on reaching no OSA status (from 4.2 to 70.8%) in parallel to a decrease of moderate (from 41.7 to 8.3%) and severe OSA (from 20.8 to 0%). RYGB is an attractive strategy for mid-term OSA remission or decrease moderate-to-severe forms of OSA in patients with obesity grade 1-2.",10.1038/s41366-021-00752-2,,,,453
620,Does Lifestyle Intervention After Gastric Bypass Surgery Prevent Weight Regain? A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Weight regain after bariatric surgery often starts after 1-2Â y, but studies evaluating strategies to prevent weight regain are lacking. The aim of this intervention was to evaluate the efficacy of a 2-y-group-based lifestyle intervention starting approximately 2Â y after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) compared with usual care on weight regain and related metabolic risk factors. A total of 165 patients with a mean of 21Â months (range 14-32) after RYGB were randomized to a lifestyle intervention group (LIG) or a usual care group (UCG). Of the 165 participants 86% completed the study. The LIG was offered 16 group meetings over 2Â y with focus on healthy diet, physical activity, and behavioural strategies to prevent weight regain, in addition to usual care. Mean (SD) total weight loss at study start was 30.1â€‰Â±â€‰8.2%, while weight regain during the intervention was 4.9â€‰Â±â€‰7.4 and 4.6â€‰Â±â€‰9.2% in the LIG and UCG, respectively (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.84). There were no differences in metabolic risk factors between the groups. The LIG participants attended 8â€‰Â±â€‰4 group meetings, with no difference in weight regain between participants with high compared to lower participation. In all the participants, a positive association between weight increase from nadir to study start and weight regain during the intervention was found.

756,Changes in Bone Mineral Density Following Weight Loss Induced by One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass in Patients with Vitamin D Supplementation.,"Little is known about changes in bone mineral density (BMD) following weight loss after one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) and the role of serum vitamin D and its supplementation on bone metabolism. We evaluated BMD after OAGB as a function of vitamin D supplementation with respect to a minimum threshold of 25-hydroxy-vitamin-D [25(OH)D] concentration, which could prevent or decelerate an eventual bone loss. Fifty bariatric patients who participated in the randomized controlled trial were included in this analysis. BMD and anthropometric measurements by DXA and laboratory parameters were assessed before (T0), at 6 (T6), and 12Â months (T12) after surgery. OAGB resulted in a 36% total body weight loss with a decrease in body fat and an increase in lean body mass. A significant decrease in BMD was seen in lumbar spine by 7%, left hip 13%, and total body 1%, but not in forearm. Bone turnover markers increased significantly but with normal parathyroid hormone concentrations. Weight loss was not associated with changes in BMD. A serum 25(OH)D concentrationâ€‰>â€‰50Â nmol/l at T6 and T12 (adequate-vitamin-D-group; AVD) showed a significant lower bone loss, compared to the inadequate-vitamin-D-group (IVD; <â€‰50Â nmol/l). Lower bone loss in the left hip showed a strong correlation with higher 25(OH)D concentrations (râ€‰=â€‰0.635, pâ€‰=â€‰0.003). These findings support a dose effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone health and suggest that 25(OH)D concentrations need to be above 50Â nmol/l at least during the first postoperative year to decelerate bone loss in patients undergoing OAGB.

1567,Randomized clinical trial of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus laparoscopic vertical banded gastroplasty for obesity.,"Laparoscopic techniques have been developed for performing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP) and vertical banded gastroplasty (LVBG) in patients with morbid obesity. It is not certain, however, which is the better technique in non-superobese patients (body mass index less than 50 kg/m(2)). Eighty-three patients (LRYGBP 37, LVBG 46) were assessed in a randomized clinical trial. Perioperative complications were recorded together with preoperative and postoperative respiratory function and mobilization rate. Patients were monitored for 2 years after operation with regard to weight change and the need for remedial surgery. There were no conversions to open surgery. The mean operating time was longer for LRYGBP than LVBG (138 versus 105 min). Five early reoperations were performed after LRYGBP (three for haemorrhage, one for ileus and one suspected leak) and one after LVBG (suspected leak). There were no differences in postoperative respiratory function or mobilization. Weight reduction was greater after LRYGBP (excess weight loss 78.3 versus 62.9 per cent 1 year after surgery, P = 0.009; 84.4 versus 59.8 per cent at 2 years, P < 0.001). Remedial surgical intervention was required in eight patients after LVBG (conversion to Roux-en-Ygastric bypass) and none after LRYGBP. LRYGBP and LVBG were comparable in terms of operative safety and postoperative recovery, but weight reduction was better after LRYGBP.",10.1002/bjs.4974,,,,458

Literature searches were conducted by a comprehensive search in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Nineteen articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. The robotic and laparoscopic procedures had no significant differences in hospitalization time, conversion, reoperation, readmission, and postoperative complications. However, RRYGB was associated with a longer mean operative time. RRYGB was not found to be superior to LRYGB. Future studies that would report detailed meaningful postoperative outcomes, such as complications and percentage of excess weight loss, are required to determine any further differences in the efficacy between RRYGB and LRYGB.",10.1007/s11695-018-3458-7,,,,459
1399,Adjustable gastric banding outcomes with and without gastrogastric imbrication sutures: a randomized controlled trial.,"The intended purpose of gastrogastric imbrication sutures in laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding is to reduce band-related complications; however, evidence demonstrating imbrication suture utility has been lacking. A 3-year randomized controlled trial on the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding with and without imbrication sutures was undertaken. We performed a prospective investigation of the outcomes using the Swedish adjustable gastric band (SAGB) with and without imbrication sutures. From January to September 2006, 100 patients undergoing SAGB placement were randomized to group 1 (n = 50, â‰¥ 2 imbrication sutures) or group 2 (n = 50, no imbrication sutures). The SAGB was implanted in both groups using a standardized pars flaccida technique. The mean operative time, hospitalization time, percentage of excess weight loss, body mass index, band fill volume, and complications were recorded. The Fisher exact test for categorical data, the independent samples t test for continuous data, and the paired t test to assess the body mass index reduction were performed. All tests were 2-tailed, and statistical significance was set at P <.05. The mean operative time was 75 Â± 7 minutes (range 50-92) and 48 Â± 4 minutes (range 32-75) for groups 1 and 2, respectively (P <.001). The mean hospitalization time was 26 Â± 12 hours (range 20-96) and 23 Â± 9 hours (range 20-48) for groups 1 and 2, respectively (P <.17). The 3-year percentage of excess weight loss was 55.7% Â± 3.4% and 58.1% Â± 4.1% for groups 1 and 2, respectively (95% confidence interval -4.0% to -.8%, P <.01). The body mass index at 3 years was 34.0 Â± 5.8 kg/m(2) and 30.3 Â± 6.4 kg/m(2) (range 1.2-6.2) for groups 1 and 2, respectively (P <.01). The fill volume at 3 years was 3.6 Â± 1.2 mL (range 1.0-5.5) and 4.5 Â± 0.5 mL (range .0-5.0) for groups 1 and 2, respectively (P <.01). Finally, slippage occurred in 1 patient (2.2%) and 1 patient (2.0%) and migration in 1 patient (2.2%) and 1 patient (2.0%) in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P = NS). No patient died in either group. The results of our randomized controlled trial have demonstrated that SAGB combined with a conservative approach to band adjustments and limited retrogastric dissection is effective and safe with and without imbrication sutures. Not using imbrication sutures results in significant benefits in operative speed with comparable clinical weight loss and intermediate term safety. These randomized controlled trial data suggest that imbrication sutures are not indispensable to laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and their use can be left to the surgeon's discretion.",10.1016/j.soard.2010.09.018,,,,460

A literature search was conducted in Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and China Science and Technology Journal Database to identify studies comparing U-RY with RY after DG for gastric cancer until the end of December 2017. Pooled odds ratio or weighted mean difference with 95% confidence interval was calculated using either fixed- or random-effects models. Perioperative outcomes such as operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and hospital stay; postoperative complications such as anastomotic bleeding, stricture and ulcer, reflux gastritis/esophagitis, delayed gastric emptying, and Roux stasis syndrome; and postoperative nutritional status (serum hemoglobin, total protein, and albumin levels) were the main outcomes assessed. Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Two randomized controlled trials and four nonrandomized observational clinical studies involving 403 and 488 patients, respectively, were included. The results of the meta-analysis showed that operative time [weighted mean difference (WMD): -12.95; 95%CI: -22.29 to -3.61; P = 0.007] and incidence of reflux gastritis/esophagitis (OR: 0.40; 95%CI: 0.20-0.80; P = 0.009), delayed gastric emptying (OR: 0.29; 95%CI: 0.14-0.61; P = 0.001), and Roux stasis syndrome (OR: 0.14; 95%CI: 0.04-0.50; P = 0.002) were reduced; and the level of serum albumin (WMD: 0.71; 95%CI: 0.24-1.19; P = 0.003) was increased in patients undergoing U-RY reconstruction compared with those undergoing RY reconstruction. No differences were found with respect to intraoperative blood loss, hospital stay, anastomotic bleeding, anastomotic stricture, anastomotic ulcer, the levels of serum hemoglobin, and serum total protein. U-RY reconstruction has some clinical advantages over RY reconstruction after DG.",10.3748/wjg.v24.i24.2628,,,,461
366,Resizing a large pouch after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: comparing the effect of two techniques on weight loss.,"Insufficient weight loss or weight regain has many causes including a large gastric pouch. A large gastric pouch may be due to the surgical technique or can be patient related (dilation). Resizing the gastric pouch may lead to additional weight loss. Currently, there is no gold standard for the revisional surgical technique. Therefore this study was performed to determine which surgical technique for revisional bariatric surgery (BS) has superior outcomes in terms of weight loss: sleeve resection of the gastrojejunostomy and gastric pouch (SGP), or resection of the gastrojejunostomy with resizing of the pouch and creation of a new anastomosis (RGJ). All patients who underwent revisional BS for insufficient weight loss or weight regain as a result of an enlarged pouch after LRYGB from April 2014 to June 2018 in our hospitals were included in this observational cohort study. Outcomes were measured in percentage total weight loss (%TWL). A total of 37 patients who underwent SGP and 21 patients who underwent RGJ as revisional BS were included in this study. The median body mass index before revisional BS was 37.6Â kg/m2 versus 35.7Â kg/m2 (SGP vs RGJ, respectively, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.115). There was no significant difference in %TWL between the two cohorts 1 and 2Â years after revisional BS, respectively; SGP 14.5% vs RGJ 11.0%, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.885 and SGP 12.3% vs RGJ 10.8%, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.604. Comparing %TWL based on weight at LRYGB, there was also no significant difference two years after revisional BS (SGP 22.0% vs RGJ 22.2%, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.885). The average use of surgical disposables for the SGP technique were lower compared to the RGJ technique. Resizing a large pouch leads to additional weight loss. Both techniques have comparable outcomes in terms of weight loss. However, based on average surgical costs, the SGP technique may be preferable.",10.1007/s00464-021-08671-z,,,,462
1115,Systematic review of definitions of failure in revisional bariatric surgery.,"There are no agreed definitions as to what constitutes a 'failure' of the primary bariatric procedure in relation to weight loss. The MEDLINE database for primary research articles was searched using obesity [title] or bariatric [title] and revision [title] or revisional [title]. The MEDLINE search retrieved 174 studies. After duplicates and exclusions were removed, 60 articles underwent analysis. Fifty-one studies included inadequate weight loss or weight regain as an indication for revision: 31/51 (61 %) gave no definition of failure, 7/20 quoted <50 % of excess weight loss at 18 months and 6/20 used <25 % excess weight loss. The majority of published studies do not define failure of bariatric surgery, and <50 % excess weight loss at 18 months was the most frequent definition identified.",10.1007/s11695-014-1541-2,,,,463
339,"Ursodeoxycholic acid for the prevention of symptomatic gallstone disease after bariatric surgery (UPGRADE): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled superiority trial.","Rapid weight loss is a major risk factor for the formation of cholesterol gallstones. Consequently, patients with morbid obesity undergoing bariatric surgery frequently develop symptomatic gallstone disease. This trial assessed the efficacy of ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo for the prevention of symptomatic gallstone disease after bariatric surgery. This multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled superiority trial enrolled patients with an intact gallbladder scheduled for laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy in three hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a web-based randomisation module to receive 900 mg ursodeoxycholic acid daily for 6 months or matched placebo. Randomisation was stratified by the presence of asymptomatic gallstones at baseline and type of surgery. Patients, clinicians, and study staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was symptomatic gallstone disease within 24 months, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned eligible patients with any post-randomisation measurement). Prespecified subgroup analyses were done based on the stratification groups. Safety was assessed in all patients who took at least one dose of the study drug. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register, NL5954. Between Jan 11, 2017, and Oct 22, 2018, 985 patients were randomly assigned to receive either ursodeoxycholic acid (n=492) or placebo (n=493). 967 patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat population, of whom 959 had data available for primary endpoint assessment. 189 (20%) patients had asymptomatic gallstones at baseline and 78 (8%) received a sleeve gastrectomy. Symptomatic gallstone disease occurred in 31 (6Â·5%) of 475 patients in the ursodeoxycholic acid group and in 47 (9Â·7%) of 484 patients in the placebo group (relative risk 0Â·67, 95% CI 0Â·43-1Â·04, p=0Â·071). Logistic regression showed a significant interaction between ursodeoxycholic acid and the presence of asymptomatic gallstones at baseline (p=0Â·046), with an effect of ursodeoxycholic acid in patients without (0Â·47, 0Â·27-0Â·84, p=0Â·0081), and no effect in patients with asymptomatic gallstones at baseline (1Â·22, 0Â·61-2Â·47, p=0Â·57). The effect was stronger in patients without gallstones at baseline undergoing RYGB (0Â·37, 0Â·20-0Â·71, p=0Â·0016), whereas the subgroup of patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy was too small to draw clear conclusions. Adverse events were rare. In the ursodeoxycholic acid group, diarrhoea occurred in four (0Â·9%) of 444 patients and skin rash in two (0Â·5%) patients. In the placebo group, diarrhoea occurred in two (0Â·4%) of 453 patients and skin rash in two (0Â·4%) patients. The total number of serious adverse events did not significantly differ between the trial groups (75 [17%] in 444 patients in the ursodeoxycholic acid group and 102 [23%] in 453 patients in the placebo group). The most common serious adverse events were abdominal pain and internal hernia. No serious adverse event was attributed to the study drug. Ursodeoxycholic acid prophylaxis did not significantly reduce the occurrence of symptomatic gallstone disease in all patients after bariatric surgery. In patients without gallstones before RYGB surgery, ursodeoxycholic acid treatment reduced the occurrence of symptomatic gallstone disease compared with placebo. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy of ursodeoxycholic acid after sleeve gastrectomy.

16,"Improvement of Metabolic-Associated Fatty Liver Disease by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Morbidly Obese Women Undergoing Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass, following a Postoperative Mediterranean-like Diet.","(1) Background: Bariatric surgery has demonstrated the capacity to improve metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) in patients with morbid obesity. In addition, the Mediterranean diet contains anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-fibrotic components, promoting a beneficial effect on MAFLD. This study aimed to assess the improvement of MAFLD, specifically liver steatosis, in morbidly obese patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and following a hypocaloric Mediterranean-like diet. (2) Methods: A prospective observational pilot study of 20 patients undergoing RYGB was conducted. The participants underwent a magnetic resonance spectroscopy study 2 weeks before the surgical act and one year postoperatively to assess the percentage of lipid content (PLC). The adherence to the Mediterranean diet was determined by the KIDMED test 1 year after surgery. (3) Results: Mean baseline PLC was 14.2 Â± 9.4%, and one year after surgery, it decreased to 4.0 Â± 1.8% (p < 0.001). A total of 12 patients (60%) were within the range of moderate adherence to the Mediterranean diet, whereas 8 patients (40%) showed a high adherence. The patients with high adherence to the Mediterranean diet presented significantly lower values of postoperative PLC. (4) Conclusions: Liver steatosis significantly reduces after RYGB. This reduction is further improved when associated with a high adherence to a Mediterranean diet.",10.3390/nu16142280,,,,465
918,Changes in Non-Diabetic Comorbid Disease Status Following Laparoscopic Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (LVSG) Versus Laparoscopic Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB) Procedures: a Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy (LVSG) have been proposed as cost-effective strategies to manage obesity-related chronic disease. The aim of this systematic review was to study the peer review literature regarding postoperative nondiabetic comorbid disease resolution or improvement reported from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LVSG and LRYGB procedures. RCTs comparing postoperative comorbid disease resolution such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, joint and musculoskeletal conditions, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and menstrual irregularities following LVSG and LRYGB were included for analysis. The studies were selected from PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, Current Contents, and the Cochrane database and reported on at least one comorbidity resolution or improvement. The present work was undertaken according to the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The Jadad method for assessment of methodological quality was applied to the included studies. Six RCTs performed between 2005 and 2015 involving a total of 695 patients (LVSG nÂ =Â 347, LRYGB nÂ =Â 348) reported on the resolution or improvement of comorbid disease following LVSG and LRYGB procedures. Both bariatric procedures provide effective and almost comparable results in improving or resolving these comorbidities. This systematic review of RCTs suggests that both LVSG and LRYGB are effective in resolving or improving preoperative nondiabetic comorbid diseases in obese patients. While results are not conclusive at this time, LRYGB may provide superior results compared to LVSG in mediating the remission and/or improvement in some conditions such as dyslipidemia and arthritis.",10.1007/s11695-016-2469-5,,,,466
1008,Postoperative Early Major and Minor Complications in Laparoscopic Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (LVSG) Versus Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB) Procedures: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy (LVSG) have been proposed as cost-effective strategies to manage obesity-related chronic disease. The aim of this meta-analysis and systematic review was to compare the ""early postoperative complication rate i.e. within 30-days"" reported from randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing these two procedures. RCTs comparing the early complication rates following LVSG and LRYGB between 2000 and 2015 were selected from PubMed, Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, Current Contents, and the Cochrane database. The outcome variables analyzed included 30-day mortality, major and minor complications and interventions required for their management, length of hospital stay, readmission rates, operating time, and conversions from laparoscopic to open procedures. Six RCTs involving a total of 695 patients (LVSG nâ€‰=â€‰347, LRYGB nâ€‰=â€‰348) reported on early major complications. A statistically significant reduction in relative odds of early major complications favoring the LVSG procedure was noted (pâ€‰=â€‰0.05). Five RCTs representing 633 patients (LVSG nâ€‰=â€‰317, LRYGB nâ€‰=â€‰316) reported early minor complications. A non-statically significant reduction in relative odds of 29Â % favoring the LVSG procedure was observed for early minor complications (pâ€‰=â€‰0.4). However, other outcomes directly related to complications which included reoperation rates, readmission rate, and 30-day mortality rate showed comparable effect size for both surgical procedures. This meta-analysis and systematic review of RCTs suggests that fewer early major and minor complications are associated with LVSG compared with LRYGB procedure. However, this does not translate into higher readmission rate, reoperation rate, or 30-day mortality for either procedure.",10.1007/s11695-016-2101-8,,,,467
859,Surgery-related gastrointestinal symptoms in a prospective study of bariatric surgery patients: 3-year follow-up.,"Having accurate information on bariatric surgery-related gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms is critical for patient care. To report on surgery-related GI symptoms over the first 3 years following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic adjustable gastric band. Three academic medical centers in the United States. As a substudy of the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery Consortium, 183 participants (pre-surgery median body mass index = 45.1 kg/m2; median age = 46 yr; 83.1% female). completed the Eating Disorder Examination-Bariatric Surgery Version interview atâ‰¥1 annual assessment. Patients self-reported frequency of dysphagia, dumping syndrome, and spontaneous vomiting. Prevalence of dysphagia at least once weekly decreased post-laparoscopic adjustable gastric band surgery from 43.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 32.2-55.6) in year 1 to 27.5% (95% CI, 15.2-39.9) in year 3 (P = .02). Dysphagia and dumping at least once weekly also appeared to decrease in years 1-3 post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (i.e., from 16.7% [95% CI, 9.4-24.1] to 10.9% [95% CI, 4.0-17.8] and from 9.9% [95% CI, 4.3-15.5] to 6.3% [95% CI, 1.7-10.9], respectively), but power was limited to evaluate trends. Vomiting at least once weekly was rare (<6%) in years 1-3 following both procedures. Controlling for potential confounders and surgical procedure, loss of control eating at least once weekly was associated with higher risk of at least once weekly dysphagia (relative risk = 2.01, 95% CI, 1.36-2.99, P = .001). The prevalence of bariatric surgery-related GI symptoms appears to decrease across follow-up. Symptoms were associated with loss of control eating, suggesting a target for clinical intervention.",10.1016/j.soard.2017.03.028,,,,468
530,Argon plasma coagulation alone versus argon plasma coagulation plus full-thickness endoscopic suturing to treat weight regain after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a prospective randomized trial (with videos).,"A significant number of patients regain weight after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Ablation with argon plasma coagulation (APC) plus endoscopic full-thickness suturing (FTS-APC) and ablation alone have been reported for treating weight regain when associated with gastrojejunostomy (GJ) dilation. However, comparative controlled data are still lacking. This was a pilot single-center open-label randomized trial comparing the effectiveness and safety of APC alone versus FTS-APC for transoral outlet reduction. Patients with at least 20% weight regain from the nadir, and GJÂ â‰¥15Â mm were considered eligible. The primary outcome was percentage total weight loss (%TWL) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of adverse events, amelioration of metabolic laboratory parameters, and improvement in quality of life and eating behavior. Forty patients meeting the eligibility criteria were enrolled from October 2017 to July 2018. Technical and clinical success rates were similar between the groups. At 12 months, the mean %TWL was 8.3% Â± 5.5% in the APC alone group versus 7.5% Â± 7.7% in the FTS-APC group (PÂ = .71). The pre-revisional % solid gastric retention at 1 hour positively correlated with the probability of achievingÂ â‰¥10% TWL at 12 months. Both groups experienced significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels at 12 months, and improvement in eating behavior and quality of life at 3 months. There were 2 cases of stenoses (1 from each group), which were successfully treated with endoscopic balloon dilation. APC alone is similar to FTS-APC in terms of technical and clinical outcomes within 1 year of follow-up. (Clinical trial registration number: NCT03094936.).",10.1016/j.gie.2020.03.3757,,,,469
704,Single-Anastomosis Plication Ileal Bypass (SAPI) in Treatment of Morbid Obesity.,"This report aimed to demonstrate the technical steps and preliminary outcome of a novel bariatric procedure, the single-anastomosis plication ileal bypass (SAPI), for the treatment of morbid obesity. Totally, 5 female patients with morbid obesity underwent SAPI procedure. The procedure consisted of 2 steps; the first step involved greater curvature plication done in a standardized manner, and the second step involved performing a stapled side-to-side anastomosis between an ileal loop 300â€‰cm distal to the duodenojejunal junction and the gastric antrum. Body mass index (BMI) and percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) at 4 months postoperatively were measured. The median age of patients was 38 years. The mean preoperative BMI decreased from 47.3Â±7.1â€‰kg/m to 36.3Â±6.1 at 4 months, postoperatively. The mean %EWL at 4 months after SAPI was 51.5Â±10.8. The mean operation time was 66Â±5.47 minutes. The median hospital stay was one day. No postoperative complications were recorded. Despite the small numbers included, the preliminary results of this report show that SAPI is a promising bariatric procedure that achieved significant decrease in BMI and satisfactory excess weight loss. Long-term follow-up of larger number of patients is necessary to reach more firm conclusions on the efficacy and safety of this novel technique.",10.1097/SLE.0000000000000600,,,,470
840,Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy Versus Banded Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass for Diabetes and Obesity: a Prospective Randomised Double-Blind Trial.,"There are very few randomised, blinded trials comparing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) versus laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) in achieving remission of type 2 diabetes (T2D), particularly silastic ring (SR)-LRYGB. We compared the effectiveness of (LSG) versus SR-LRYGB among patients with T2D and morbid obesity. Prospective, randomised, parallel, 2-arm, blinded clinical trial conducted in a single Auckland (New Zealand) centre. Eligible patients aged 20-55Â years, T2D of at least 6Â months duration and BMI 35-65Â kg/m2 were randomised 1:1 to LSG (nÂ =Â 58) or SR-LRYGB (nÂ =Â 56) using random number codes disclosed after anaesthesia induction. Primary outcome was T2D remission defined by different HbA1c thresholds at 1Â year. Secondary outcomes included weight loss, quality of life, anxiety and depressive symptoms, post-operative complications and mortality. MeanÂ Â±Â standard deviation (SD) pre-operative BMI was 42.5Â Â±Â 6.2Â kg/m2, HbA1c 63Â Â±Â 16Â mmol/mol (30% insulin-treated, 28% had diabetes duration over 10Â years). Proportions achieving HbA1c â‰¤Â 38Â mmol/mol, <Â 42Â mmol/mol, <Â 48Â mmol/mol and <Â 53Â mmol/mol without diabetes medication at 1Â year in SR-LRYGB vs LSG were 38 vs 43% (pÂ =Â 0.56), 52 vs 49% (pÂ =Â 0.85), 75 vs 72% (pÂ =Â 0.83) and 80 vs 77% (pÂ =Â 0.82), respectively.

Gastrointestinal complications were more frequent after SR-LRYGB (including 3 ulcers, 1 anastomotic leak, 1 abdominal bleeding). Quality of life and depression symptoms improved significantly in both groups. Despite significantly greater weight loss after SR-LRYGB, there was similar T2D remission and psychosocial improvement after LSG and SR-LRYGB at 1Â year.

735,"Demographic, clinical, and behavioral determinants of 7-year weight change trajectories in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients.","Weight change trajectories after weight-loss surgery may vary significantly. This study evaluated the weight trajectories of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) patients and identified the distinct clinical, behavioral, and demographic features of patients by trajectory. Data from 2918 RYGB patients from a comprehensive medical center between January 2004 and November 2016 were included. This retrospective, observational study used data for RYGB patients up to year 7 postsurgery. Group-based trajectory models were fitted for percentage weight change. Variables evaluated by trajectory included age, sex, diagnoses, medications, smoking, presurgical body mass index, preoperative weight loss, and early postoperative weight loss. Of 3215 possible patients, 2918 (90.8%) were included (mean ageâ€¯=â€¯46.2 Â± 11.2 yr, body mass indexâ€¯=â€¯46.9 Â± 7.9 kg/m2 at the time of surgery). Three weight change trajectories were identified (above average, average, and below average). Mean percentage weight change at the nadir for the above average group was -42.85% Â± 5.7% compared with -31.57% Â± 5.0% in the average group and -22.74% Â± 5.7% in the below average group. Compared with the above average group, the below average group was more likely to be male (odds ratio [OR]â€¯=â€¯2.40, P < .0001) and have diabetes (noninsulin users, ORâ€¯=â€¯2.08, P < .0001), but less likely to have a smoking history (ORâ€¯=â€¯.62, Pâ€¯=â€¯.0007) or take sleep medications (ORâ€¯=â€¯.50, Pâ€¯=â€¯.005). Below average group patients had a lower BMI at the time of surgery (ORâ€¯=â€¯.91, P < .0001). Lower initial weight loss postsurgery was associated with a greater chance of a poorer weight outcomes (ORâ€¯=â€¯1.64, P < .0001).

Retrospective analysis comparing pre- and postoperative results of oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) with determinations of insulin and C-peptide, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and BMI at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months in 99 overweight patients (BMI 26.3 Â± 4.0 kg/m(2); 59 men) with type 2 diabetes at the General Hospital of Chengdu Military Region. 79 patients (80%) achieved complete remission (maintaining random blood glucose levels < 11.1 mmol/l, fasting blood glucose levels < 7.0 mmol/l, 2-hour OGTT blood glucose levels < 11.1 mmol/l, and glycated hemoglobin < 6.5%). Nine cases (9%) were 'improved' (reduced medication or diet controlled blood sugar), and 11 cases did not meet either criterion ('unchanged'). Patients in complete remission were younger and heavier, more often men, had significantly shorter history of diabetes (4.3 Â± 3.8 years vs. 7.6 Â± 3.8 years, p < 0.05), and exhibited significantly higher fasting and OGTT levels of C-peptide and insulin, and HOMA-IR than the other 2 groups (p < 0.05-0.01).

614,Effectiveness of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity in achieving weight loss outcomes.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) are commonly performed weight loss procedures worldwide. Unfortunately, few studies have compared percentage total weight loss (%TWL) following these procedures. This research compared short-term, mid-term and long-term %TWL by LRYGB and LSG. Selected databases were searched for original articles that compared %TWL by LSG and LRYGB. Review manager 5.3 was used for data analysis. Effect summary was presented by forest plot.

749,Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery alters serum metabolites and fatty acids in patients with morbid obesity.,"Bariatric surgery induces significant weight loss, increases insulin sensitivity, and reduces mortality, but the underlying mechanisms are not clear. It was hypothesized that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery improves metabolic profile along with weight loss. The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate changes in serum metabolites and fatty acids (FA) at 2Â weeks and 6Â months after RYGB. Serum samples were collected pre-surgery, at 2Â weeks and 6Â months post-surgery from 20 patients undergoing RYGB surgery. Serum non-esterified free FA (NEFA) were measured. Serum metabolites and FA were measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and improved direct fatty acid methyl ester synthesis and the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method, respectively, in subjects who completed follow-up at 6Â months (nÂ =Â 8). Mean (standard deviation) percent total weight loss was 6.70% (1.7) and 24.91% (6.63) at 2Â weeks (nÂ =Â 15) and 6Â months (nÂ =Â 8) post-surgery, respectively. NEFA were significantly reduced at 6Â months post-surgery (PÂ =Â 0.001, nÂ =Â 8). Serum branched chain amino acids, 2-aminobutyrate, butyrate, 2-hydroxybutyrate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, acetone, 2-methylglutarate, and 2-oxoisocaproate were significantly reduced, while serum alanine, glycine, pyruvate, and taurine were significantly elevated at 6Â months post-surgery compared with pre-surgery (nÂ =Â 8, PÂ <Â 0.05). Also, serum FA C10:0, C13:0, C14:0, C15:0, and C18:0 increased significantly (nÂ =Â 8, PÂ <Â 0.05) by 6Â months post-surgery. Changes in serum metabolites and FA at 6Â months post-RYGB surgery in this pilot study with limited number of participants are suggestive of metabolic improvement; larger studies are warranted for confirmation.",10.1002/dmrr.3045,,,,476

818,A randomised controlled trial of a duodenal-jejunal bypass sleeve device (EndoBarrier) compared with standard medical therapy for the management of obese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"The prevalence of obesity and obesity-related diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is increasing. Exclusion of the foregut, as occurs in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, has a key role in the metabolic improvements that occur following bariatric surgery, which are independent of weight loss. Endoscopically placed duodenal-jejunal bypass sleeve devices, such as the EndoBarrier (GI Dynamics, Lexington, Massachusetts, USA), have been designed to create an impermeable barrier between chyme exiting the stomach and the mucosa of the duodenum and proximal jejunum. The non-surgical and reversible nature of these devices represents an attractive therapeutic option for patients with obesity and T2DM by potentially improving glycaemic control and reducing their weight. In this multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-blinded trial, male and female patients aged 18-65 years with a body mass index 30-50 kg/m2 and inadequately controlled T2DM on oral antihyperglycaemic medications (glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 58-97 mmol/mol) will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the EndoBarrier device (n=80) for 12 months or conventional medical therapy, diet and exercise (n=80). The primary outcome measure will be a reduction in HbA1c by 20% at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures will include percentage weight loss, change in cardiovascular risk factors and medications, quality of life, cost, quality-adjusted life years accrued and adverse events. Three additional subgroups will investigate the mechanisms behind the effect of the EndoBarrier device, looking at changes in gut hormones, metabolites, bile acids, microbiome, food hedonics and preferences, taste, brain reward system responses to food, eating and addictive behaviours, body fat content, insulin sensitivity, and intestinal tissue gene expression.

1191,Metabolic outcomes 2 years following gastric bypass surgery in people with type 2 diabetes: an observational cohort study.,"Gastric bypass surgery induces early remission or significant improvement in type 2 diabetes (T2D). To assess effectiveness of stopping glucose-lowering treatment at the time of surgery. Observational cohort analysis. We identified 101 patients (62 women) with T2D who had undergone gastric bypass surgery at a mean (SD, standard deviation) age of 51.4 (9.0) years. We recorded weight, body mass index (BMI), glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure (BP), total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol preoperatively and at a median 4, 12 and 24 months postoperatively, and changes to glucose-lowering therapy. Mean (SD) baseline BMI was 50.3 (6.3) kg/m(2), HbA1c 65.3 (18.5) mmol/mol, systolic BP 146.0 (18.0) mmHg, diastolic BP 87.0 (10.8) mmHg and total cholesterol-to-HDL cholesterol ratio 4.0 (1.2). Mean (95% confidence interval) reduction in BMI was 16.4 (14.1-18.7) kg/m(2), HbA1c 23.6 (17.6-29.6) mmol/mol, systolic BP 12.9 (5.9-19.8) mmHg, diastolic BP 6.1 (1.8-10.5) mmHg and total cholesterol-to-HDL cholesterol ratio 1.1 (0.6-1.5) at 24 months (P < 0.001 for all measures). Although 91% of patients were receiving glucose-lowering therapies preoperatively, complete (HbA1c < 42 mmol/mol) and partial (HbA1c 42-48 mmol/mol) remissions of T2D were seen in 62.1% and 5.2% at 2 years postoperatively. Cessation of glucose-lowering therapies in people with T2D at the time of gastric bypass surgery was clinically effective. The majority of patients remained in complete or partial remission of diabetes up to 2 years postoperatively.",10.1093/qjmed/hcu060,,,,479
352,Effectiveness and Safety of a Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet on Weight Regain Following Bariatric Surgery.,"Obesity is one of the major public health problems worldwide and bariatric surgery is considered the gold standard treatment for severe obesity. Although the literature supports the safety and efficacy of the very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) in patients with obesity, there is no study analyzing the use in case of failure or weight regain after bariatric surgery. This work has the purpose of assessing the response to a VLCKD (PnkÂ® method) in this population. We have conducted an observational, retrospective, and descriptive study with the analysis of medical charts of private offices where patients were examined between 2014 and 2019, totalizing 11 participants who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) without a reduction of 50% in body weight excess or any weight regain after the surgery. The patients followed the first stage of a commercial weight loss program (PnkÂ® method) which consists of a VLCKD (600-800Â kcal/day), low in carbohydrates and lipids. A significant reduction was observed (p-valueâ€‰<â€‰0.05) in weight, body mass index (BMI), abdominal circumference (AC), and glycated hemoglobin (A1C) post-ketogenic diet. Uric acid, transaminases, urea, and creatinine values did not show differences between pre- and post-ketosis. During the course of the study, no serious adverse events were reported. This study has shown that the ketogenic diet can be recommended as an effective and safe treatment for patients who progressed with insufficient weight loss or regain after bariatric surgery.",10.1007/s11695-021-05703-4,,,,480
1055,Influence of Insulin Resistance Status on the Development of Gallstones Following Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass: a Prospective Cohort Study.,"The occurrence of gallstones following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has been extensively reported. As RYGB promotes improvement in insulin resistance (IR), which is one of the factors enrolled in the pathophysiology of gallstones, this study aims to determine the influence of IR and its post-RYGB course on the development of gallstones. This is a prospective cohort study that enrolled 108 morbidly obese subjects free of gallstones which underwent RYGB and were followed up for 24 months, through clinical, laboratory, and ultrasound examinations. IR was assessed through the surrogate marker homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). Of the individuals evaluated, 29 (26.8%) developed gallstones following RYGB. In the univariate analysis, postsurgical gallstones were associated with preoperative HOMA (pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001), preoperative fasting glucose (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0019), preoperative fasting insulin (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0001), and preoperative triglycerides (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative HOMA was the only factor independently associated with gallstones (pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). The incidence of gallstones among individuals with IR was 46.8%; in the non-IR subjects, the incidence was 7.4% (pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). Preoperative IR led to a relative risk of 6.02 (95% CIâ€‰=â€‰2.1-17.3; pâ€‰=â€‰0.0009) of gallstones. As gallstones often occur following RYGB, there is controversy regarding their management. Some authors propose systematic cholecystectomy along with RYGB, while others suggest that the aggregate risk of the concomitant approach is significantly higher. As IR was a significant risk factor in this study, an individualized approach for this population may be proposed. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.",10.1007/s11695-015-1815-3,,,,481
83,Association of bariatric surgery with indicated and unintended outcomes: An umbrella review and meta-analysis for risk-benefit assessment.,"Bariatric surgery can cause numerous functional changes to recipients, some of which are unintended. However, a systematic evaluation of wide-angled health benefits and risks following bariatric surgery has not been conducted. We systematically evaluated published systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials and observational studies reporting the association between bariatric surgery and health outcomes. We performed subgroup analyses by surgery type and sensitivity analysis, excluding gastric band. Thirty systematic reviews and 82 meta-analyzed health outcomes were included in this review. A total of 66 (80%) health outcomes were significantly associated with bariatric surgery, of which 10 were adverse outcomes, including suicide, fracture, gastroesophageal reflux after sleeve gastrectomy, and neonatal morbidities. The other 56 outcomes were health benefits including new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) (odds ratio [OR]â€‰=Â 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI]â€‰=Â 0.19-0.79), hypertension (ORâ€‰=Â 0.36; 95% CIâ€‰=Â 0.33-0.40), dyslipidemia (ORâ€‰=Â 0.33; 95% CIâ€‰=Â 0.14-0.81), cancers (ORâ€‰=Â 0.65; 95% CIâ€‰=Â 0.53-0.80), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and women's health. Surgery is associated with reductions in all-cause mortality and death due to cancer, DM, and CVD. Bariatric surgery has both beneficial and harmful effects on a broader than expected array of patients' health outcomes. An expansion of the indication for bariatric surgery could be discussed to include a broader population with metabolic vulnerabilities.",10.1111/obr.13670,,,,482
457,Preoperative inhibitory control predicts weight loss 1 year after bariatric surgery.,"Executive function (EF) and, in particular, inhibitory control have been associated with weight loss (WL) in behavioural WL treatment for obesity. Few studies have focused on the relationship between preoperative inhibitory control and post-operative WL following bariatric surgery, and the potential mediating role of maladaptive eating behaviours is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate preoperative executive function as a predictor of WL at 1 year following bariatric surgery. Additionally, we aimed to explore the mediating role of postoperative compulsive grazing in the relationship between inhibitory control and WL. A prospective observational study in which participants completed neuropsychological testing 30 days before and 1 year following surgery (n = 61/80; 76% follow-up). Participants were 80% female, with an average age of 41 years. Approximately 54% underwent gastric bypass, 26% gastric sleeve and 20% had one anastomosis gastric bypass. Regression analyses were employed to examine the relationship between preoperative EF and percentage total weight loss (%TWL), and structural equation modelling was used to examine compulsive grazing as a mediator. After adjusting for control variables, preoperative inhibitory control explained 8% of the variance in %TWL (p â‰¤ 0.05). Preoperative working memory was not significantly associated with %TWL. Postoperative compulsive grazing was significantly associated with %TWL (p â‰¤ 0.05), but did not mediate the association between preoperative inhibitory control and %TWL. The results suggest that preoperative inhibitory control performance is a relevant predictor of postoperative WL and that compulsive grazing is a maladaptive eating behaviour that warrants clinical attention after surgery.",10.1002/erv.2801,,,,483
1263,Endoscopic suturing for transoral outlet reduction increases weight loss after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.,"Weight regain or insufficient loss after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is common. This is partially attributable to dilatation of the gastrojejunostomy (GJ), which diminishes the restrictive capacity of RYGB. Endoluminal interventions for GJ reduction are being explored as alternatives to revision surgery. We performed a randomized, blinded, sham-controlled trial to evaluate weight loss after sutured transoral outlet reduction (TORe). Patients with weight regain or inadequate loss after RYGB and GJ diameter greater than 2 cm were assigned randomly to groups that underwent TORe (nÂ = 50) or a sham procedure (controls, nÂ = 27). Intraoperative performance, safety, weight loss, and clinical outcomes were assessed. Subjects who received TORe had a significantly greater mean percentage weight loss from baseline (3.5%; 95% confidence interval, 1.8%-5.3%) than controls (0.4%; 95% confidence interval, 2.3% weight gain to 3.0% weight loss) (PÂ = .021), using a last observation carried forward intent-to-treat analysis. As-treated analysis also showed greater mean percentage weight loss in the TORe group than controls (3.9% and 0.2%, respectively; PÂ = .014). Weight loss or stabilization was achieved in 96% subjects receiving TORe and 78% of controls (PÂ = .019). The TORe group had reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P < .001) and a trend toward improved metabolic indices. In addition, 85% of the TORe group reported compliance with the healthy lifestyle eating program, compared with 53.8% of controls; 83% of TORe subjects said they would undergo the procedure again, and 78% said they would recommend the procedure to a friend. The groups had similar frequencies of adverse events. A multicenter randomized trial provides Level I evidence that TORe reduces weight regain after RYGB. These results were achieved using a superficial suction-based device; greater levels of weight loss could be achieved with newer, full-thickness suturing devices. TORe is one approach to avoid weight regain; a longitudinal multidisciplinary approach with dietary counseling and behavioral changes are required for long-term results.

274,Effectiveness of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass vs Sleeve Gastrectomy on Lipid Levels in Type 2 Diabetes: a Meta-analysis.,"Obesity and its co-morbidities, including type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and dyslipidemia, are accompanied by excess cardiovascular morbi-mortality. Aside from excess low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), atherogenic dyslipidemia (AD), mainly characterized by elevated triglycerides and decreased high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, is often present in T2DM obese patients. Bariatric surgery, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG), has become a reference treatment in that population. However, the respective effects of RYGB vs SG on lipid metabolism in T2DM patients have been rarely studied. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, comparing the effects of RGYBG vs SG on lipid metabolism 12 months after surgery in T2DM patients, was performed. Four studies including a total of 298 patients (151 patients in the RYGB and 147 patients in the SG group) were examined. Despite a greater decrease in body mass index and greater improvement in glycemic control in RYGB compared to SG. RYGB vs SG was more effective in reducing total cholesterol, LDL-C, and non-HDL-C levels (mean difference [MD] -26.10 mg/dL, 95 % CI -38.88 to -13.50, p<0.00001; [MD] -20.10 mg/dL, 95 % CI -27.90 to -12.20, p<0.00001 and MD 31.90 mg/dl, 95 % CI -46.90 to -16.80, p<0.00001, respectively). The superiority of RYGB vs SG in reducing LDL-C, with an effect comparable to a moderate-intensity statin, suggests RYBG should be favored in hypercholesterolemic T2DM patients in order to further reduce cardiovascular risk.",10.1007/s11605-022-05338-5,,,,485
26,"Significant and distinct impacts of sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on esophageal acid exposure, esophageal motility, and endoscopic findings: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","The lack of standardized objective assessment of esophageal physiology and anatomy contributes to controversies regarding the effects of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on gastroesophageal reflux disease. This study aimed to investigate esophageal acid exposure, esophageal motility, and endoscopic findings before and after SG and RYGB. This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting at least 1 objective measure of esophageal physiology and/or esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) at baseline and after SG or RYGB. The changes in pH test, manometry, and EGD parameters were summarized. Acid exposure time (AET) and DeMeester score (DMS) significantly increased after SG (mean difference [MD]: 2.1 [95% CI, 0.3-3.9] and 8.6 [95% CI, 2.0-15.2], respectively). After RYGB, both AET and DMS significantly decreased (MD: -4.2 [95% CI, -6.1 to -2.3] and -16.6 [95% CI, -25.4 to -7.8], respectively). Lower esophageal sphincter resting pressure and length significantly decreased after SG (MD: -2.8 [95% CI, -4.6 to -1.1] and -0.1 [95% CI, -0.2 to -0.02], respectively). There were no significant changes in esophageal manometry after RYGB. The relative risks of erosive esophagitis were 2.3 (95% CI, 1.5-3.5) after SG and 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.8) after RYGB. The prevalence rates of Barrett esophagus changed from 0% to 3.6% after SG and from 2.7% to 1.4% after RYGB. SG resulted in the worsening of all objective parameters, whereas RYGB resulted in the improvement in AET, DMS, and EGD findings. Determining the risk factors associated with these outcomes can help in surgical choice.",10.1016/j.gassur.2024.06.014,,,,486
1198,Omentectomy in addition to gastric bypass surgery and influence on insulin sensitivity: a randomized double blind controlled trial.,"Accumulation of visceral adipose tissue is associated with insulin resistance and cardio-vascular disease. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether removal of a large amount of visceral fat by omentectomy in conjunction with Roux en-Y gastric bypass operation (RYGB) results in enhanced improvement of insulin sensitivity compared to gastric bypass surgery alone. Eighty-one obese women scheduled for RYGB were included in the study. They were randomized to RYGB or RYGB in conjunction with omentectomy. Insulin sensitivity was measured by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp before operation and sixty-two women were also reexamined 2 years post-operatively. The primary outcome measure was insulin sensitivity and secondary outcome measures included cardio-metabolic risk factors. Two-year weight loss was profound but unaffected by omentectomy. Before intervention, there were no clinical or metabolic differences between the two groups. The difference in primary outcome measure, insulin sensitivity, was not significant between the non-omentectomy (6.7Â Â±Â 1.6Â mg/kg body weight/minute) and omentectomy groups (6.6Â Â±Â 1.5Â mg/kg body weight/minute) after 2 years. Nor did any of the cardio-metabolic risk factors that were secondary outcome measures differ significantly. Addition of omentectomy to gastric bypass operation does not give an incremental effect on long term insulin sensitivity or cardio-metabolic risk factors. The clinical usefulness of omentectomy in addition to gastric bypass operation is highly questionable. NCT01785134.",10.1016/j.clnu.2014.01.004,,,,487
965,Improved glucose metabolism after gastric bypass: evolution of the paradigm.,"Glucose metabolism is improved in patients with type 2 diabetes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). To quantify the relative contribution of calorie restriction, rerouting of nutrients, and adipose tissue reduction. University Hospital. Fifteen diabetic patients, (47Â±9 yr, body mass index 41.3Â±4.2 kg/m2) were randomized to a 2-week very low-calorie diet (VLCD) regimen or normal diet before RYGB. A euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, indirect calorimetry, and a standard meal test were performed prediet, postdiet (preoperatively), and 2 weeks and 12 months postoperatively. The primary outcome was whole-body insulin sensitivity (M) measured with the clamp 2 weeks postoperatively. In the VLCD group, after 2 weeks of calorie restriction, M improved (2.9Â±1.3 to 4.2Â±1.1 mg/kg/min, P = .005) with no further change at 2 weeks postoperatively. In the normal diet group 2 weeks postoperatively, M was similar to the VLCD group (4.7Â±1.7 versus 4.2Â±1.1, P = .61). One year postoperatively, M improved further in both groups. The improvement in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake after VLCD and RYGB was entirely accounted for by nonoxidative glucose disposal (NOGD), whereas weight loss at 1 year postoperatively was associated with an increase in NOGD and glucose oxidation. Postprandial glucose improved after VLCD (P<.05) and even more 2 weeks after RYGB (P<.05) with no further change after 1 year. Improved whole-body insulin sensitivity and postprandial glucose response occur early after RYGB. Low calorie intake and rerouting of nutrients contribute through distinct mechanisms. Weight loss contributes by increasing whole-body insulin sensitivity, including glucose oxidation and NOGD. These data suggest that the combination of different mechanisms is what makes RYGB an effective intervention for type 2 diabetes.",10.1016/j.soard.2016.03.020,,,,488
231,[Occurrence of gastric cancer after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a systematic review].,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is an important obesity surgery. The risk of remnant gastric cancer after RYGB for obesity is gaining growing attention from bariatric surgeons and patients with obesity. This systematic review included articles from major databases internationally and domestically that specifically described the remnant gastric cancer after RYGB intervention, a total of 21 cases was subsequently analyzed. The average median time from post-operative RYGB to diagnosis of gastric cancer was 11 years (1-28 years), the duration of gastric cancer symptoms lasted 7 days to 6 years, abdominal pain is the most common (71.4%), especially in the upper abdomen (33.3%), followed by nausea and vomiting (33.3%), over-weight loss (33.3%), and abdominal bloating (28.6%), etc. Neoplasm location was reported to occur in the antrum or the pre-pyloric region (71.4%), with adenocarcinoma being the most common tumor histology observed (71.4%), tumor stage III-IV as the most diagnosed, 38.1% of tumor were deemed to be unresectable, 52.4% of the patients performed subtotal gastrectomy and lymphadenectomy. In addition, a global article investigating the occurrence of esophageal gastric cancer after RYGB in 64 cases revealed the common preoperative medical history include smoking habits (37.5%), alcohol issues (14.0%), GERD (86.0%), presence with Barret esophagus (10.9%), patients that has other malignant tumor medical history (6.3%), first-degree relatives (6.3%), or other family members with gastric esophagus cancer family history. Although the incidence of gastric cancer after RYGB is rare, the increasing prevalence of gastric cancer development is one of great concern. A rise in clinical cases of patients treated with RYGB presents a target for future studies. Risk of gastric cancer after RYGB should be evaluated and considered in high-risk cases.",10.3760/cma.j.cn441530-20211221-00515,,,,489
782,Incidence of Hypoglycemia After Gastric Bypass vs Sleeve Gastrectomy: A Randomized Trial.,"We compared the incidence of hypoglycemia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) vs sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Randomized, open-label trial conducted at the outpatient obesity clinic in a university hospital in Rome, Italy. The primary aim was the incidence of reactive hypoglycemia (<3.1 mmol/L after 75-g oral glucose load) at 1 year after surgery. Secondary aims were hypoglycemia under everyday life conditions, insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and lipid profile. Of 175 eligible patients, 120 were randomized 1:1 to RYGB or SG; 117 (93%) completed the 12-month follow-up. Reactive hypoglycemia was detected in 14% and 29% of SG and RYGB patients (P = 0.079), respectively, with the effect of treatment in multivariate analysis significant at P = 0.018. Daily hypoglycemic episodes during continuous glucose monitoring did not differ between groups (P = 0.75). Four of 59 RYGB subjects (6.8%) had 1 to 3 hospitalizations for symptomatic hypoglycemia vs 0 in SG. The static Î²-cell glucose sensitivity index increased after both treatments (P < 0.001), but the dynamic Î²-cell glucose sensitivity index increased significantly in SG (P = 0.008) and decreased in RYGB (P = 0.004 for time Ã— treatment interaction). Whole-body insulin sensitivity increased about 10-fold in both groups. We show that reactive hypoglycemia is no less common after SG and is not a safer option than RYGB, but RYGB is associated with more severe hypoglycemic episodes. This is likely due to the lack of improvement of Î²-cell sensitivity to changes in circulating glucose after RYGB, which determines an inappropriately high insulin secretion.",10.1210/jc.2017-01695,,,,490
370,Efficacy and effects of bariatric surgery in the treatment of obesity: Network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Bariatric surgery (BS) is recommended for subjects with a Body Mass Index (BMI) over of 40Â kg/m2 or with a BMI between 35 and 40Â kg/m2 with obesity-related comorbidities. Aim of the study was to compare different types of BS with medical therapy (MT) for the treatment of obesity. We conducted a network-meta-analysis (NMA) including randomized clinical trials comparing different BS techniques versus MT in people with obesity, with a duration â‰¥24 weeks (PROSPERO, #CRD42020160359). Primary endpoint was BMI. Indirect comparisons of different types of surgery were performed by NMA. Types of BS included: laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy (SG), bilio-pancreatic diversion (BPD); greater curvature plication (GCP); one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB); Laparoscopic Vertical Banded Gastroplasty (LVBG) and duodenal switch (DS). 43 trials were retrieved in this metanalysis. BS was associated with a significant reduction in BMI, systolic blood pressure, triglyceride and fasting glucose, and with a significant increase of HDL cholesterol when compared to MT. In direct comparisons, RYGB was more effective than LAGB, LVBG, and GCP, but less effective than DS, whereas LAGB was less effective than LVBG and SG. In the NMA, DS and BPD appeared to be more effective than other procedures. BS produces a greater weight loss than MT in morbidly obese patients, inducing a greater improvement of obesity-associated metabolic parameters. Available data are insufficient to assess the effect of BS on mortality. Different surgical procedures are heterogeneous for efficacy and safety.",10.1016/j.numecd.2021.06.018,,,,491

In order to investigate its efficacy and feasibility, PubMed was searched up to April 25th, 2015. Ten studies reporting on 247 patients with a mean age of 37.3 years were eligible. Mean preoperative Body Mass Index was 42.4 kg/m(2). Most common comorbidities were diabetes and dyslipidemia. Mean operative time was 128.5 min and mean length of hospital stay was 3.3 days. No conversions to open surgery were reported. Clinical outcomes of the transumbilical Roux-en-Y gastric bypass appear to be comparable with those of the conventional laparoscopic one. However, more trials are necessary to elucidate all of its aspects.",10.1016/j.ijsu.2015.06.077,,,,492
1060,Self-Reported Eating Disorder Symptoms Before and After Gastric Bypass and Duodenal Switch for Super Obesity--a 5-Year Follow-Up Study.,"This study assessed eating disorder pathology in persons with obesity before and after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (DS), in a 5-year follow-up study. Sixty participants with BMI 50-60 kg/m(2) were randomly assigned to RYGB (n = 31) or DS (n = 29). The participants completed the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) before and 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years after surgery. Before surgery, the prevalence of objective bulimic episodes was 29 % in the RYGB group and 32 % in the DS group. The prevalence improved during the first 12 months after surgery in both groups. After 5 years, the prevalence of objective bulimic episodes was 22 % in the RYGB group and 7 % in the DS group. The difference between groups throughout follow-up was non-significant (logistic regression model). A linear mixed model showed that global EDE-Q score was not a significant predictor for weight loss after surgery, but participants reporting objective bulimic episodes before surgery had significantly lower BMI than those with no episodes after 2 years (p = 0.042) and 5 years (p = 0.013). Global EDE-Q score was significantly lower in the DS group after 5 years (p = 0.009) (linear mixed model). Objective bulimic episodes but not global EDE-Q score before surgery predicted greater weight loss after RYGB and DS. The DS group had a significantly lower global EDE-Q score than the RYGB group 5 years after surgery.",10.1007/s11695-015-1790-8,,,,493
428,Intraoperative leak test is associated with lower postoperative bleed rate in primary sleeve gastrectomy: a propensity matched analysis of primary and revision bariatric surgery using the MBSAQIP database.,"Gastrointestinal leaks after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) occur infrequently but lead to clinical and socioeconomic burden on patients. Surgeons perform intraoperative leak test (IOLT) via gastric tube or endoscopy to help prevent postoperative leaks. However, there is knowledge gap in the literature on effectiveness of IOLT during bariatric surgery. In this observational cohort study using the 2015-2017 MBSAQIP database, we compared the outcomes in patients who received IOLT with those who did not during primary or revision RYGB and SG. The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative leak. Secondary outcomes were procedure duration and the rates of 30-day postoperative bleed, readmission, reoperation and intervention. Propensity score matching was used to assemble cohorts of patients with similar baseline characteristics. Among 363,042 patients, 82% underwent IOLT. Four subgroups of patients who underwent operations with or without IOLT during primary RYGB (nâ€‰=â€‰13,756), primary SG (nâ€‰=â€‰110,810), revision RYGB (nâ€‰=â€‰1140), and revision SG (nâ€‰=â€‰5576) had similar propensity scores and were matched 1:1. Patients who underwent IOLT had similar postoperative leak rates compared to those who did not (Primary RYGB with IOLT 0.7% v. without IOLT 0.6%; Primary SG 0.4% v. 0.3%; Revision RYGB 2.3% v. 1.0%; Revision SG 1.1% v. 0.7%). In primary SG subgroup, patients who underwent IOLT had lower postoperative bleed rates (0.6% v. 0.8%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.002). In primary RYGB and SG subgroups, operations with IOLT were slightly longer. Postoperative leak rates after primary and revision bariatric surgery were low and similar irrespective of IOLT. Patients who had IOLT during primary SG had lower postoperative bleed rates. Current judgment as to whether to perform an IOLT leads to excellent outcomes, and thus, current practices should continue. However, one should consider an IOLT during primary SG, not necessarily to reduce leak rates but to help reduce postoperative bleeding occurrences.",10.1007/s00464-020-08264-2,,,,494
372,Perioperative mortality in bariatric surgery: meta-analysis.,"Bariatric surgery is an established treatment for severe obesity; however, fewer than 1 per cent of eligible patients undergo surgery. The perceived risk of surgery may contribute to the low uptake. The aim of this study was to determine perioperative mortality associated with bariatric surgery, comparing different operation types and data sources. A literature search of Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted to identify studies published between 1 January 2014 and 31 July 2020. Inclusion criteria were studies of at least 1000 patients reporting short-term mortality after bariatric surgery. Data were collected on RCTs. Meta-analysis was performed to establish overall mortality rates across different study types. The primary outcome measure was perioperative mortality. Different operation types were compared, along with study type, in subgroup analyses. The study was registered at PROSPERO (2019: CRD 42019131632). Some 4356 articles were identified and 58 met the inclusion criteria. Data were available on over 3.6 million patients. There were 4707 deaths. Pooled analysis showed an overall mortality rate of 0.08 (95 per cent c.i. 0.06 to 0.10; 95 per cent prediction interval 0 to 0.21) per cent. In subgroup analysis, there was no statistically significant difference between overall, 30-day, 90-day or in-hospital mortality (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.29). There was no significant difference in reported mortality for RCTs, large studies, national databases or registries (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.60). The pooled mortality rates by procedure type in ascending order were: 0.03 per cent for gastric band, 0.05 per cent for sleeve gastrectomy, 0.09 per cent for one-anastomosis gastric bypass, 0.09 per cent for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and 0.41 per cent for duodenal switch (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001 between operations). Bariatric surgery is safe, with low reported perioperative mortality rates.",10.1093/bjs/znab245,,,,495
1376,Impact of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic gastric bypass on HbA1c blood level and pharmacological treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in severe or morbidly obese patients. Results of a multicenter prospective study at 1 year.,"Gastric bypass (GBP) has proved its efficacy 30Â years ago in the management of diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for severe obese patients. More recently, interesting results have been published after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in the same indication. Between 2005 and 2008, three bariatric centers have prospectively collected the data of T2DM patients treated by laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGBP) or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Effects on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), pharmacological treatment and excess weight loss after 1Â year of surgery have been analyzed. All patients (35 LGBP and 33 LSG) were treated with oral anti-diabetics (OAD) or insulin before surgery (32 OAD and three insulin in LGBP group and 27 OAD and six insulin in LSG group). The average body mass index (BMI) in the LGBP group was 47.9 and 50.6Â kg/mÂ² in the LSG group. At 1Â year after surgery, the average HbA1c lost was 2,537 in the GBP group and 2,175 in the SG group. T2DM had resolved (withdrawal of pharmacological treatment) in 60% of the LGBP group and 75.8% of the LSG group. Reduced use of pharmacological therapy was noted in 31.42% of the LGBP group and 15.15% of the LSG group. Percentage excess weight loss and BMI lost were 56.35% and 29.75% in the LGBP group and 60.11% and 29.80% in the LSG group, respectively. During short-term follow-up, the impact on regulation of HbA1c blood level of LGBP or LSG is important. At 1Â year after surgery, LSG seems to be as effective as LGBP for the management of T2DM in severely obese patients.",10.1007/s11695-011-0385-2,,,,496
1153,Attenuated improvements in adiponectin and fat loss characterize type 2 diabetes non-remission status after bariatric surgery.,"To identify the metabolic determinants of type 2 diabetes non-remission status after bariatric surgery at 12 and 24 months. A total of 40 adults [mean Â± sd body mass index 36 Â± 3 kg/m(2) , age 48 Â± 9 years, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 9.7 Â± 2%) undergoing bariatric surgery [Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG)] were enrolled in the present study, the Surgical Treatment and Medication Potentially Eradicate Diabetes Efficiently (STAMPEDE) trial. Type 2 diabetes remission was defined as HbA1c <6.5% and fasting glucose <126 mg/dl (i.e. <7 mmol/l) without antidiabetic medication. Indices of insulin secretion and sensitivity were calculated from plasma glucose, insulin and C-peptide values during a 120-min mixed-meal tolerance test. Body fat, incretins (glucagon-like polypeptide-1, gastric inhibitory peptide, ghrelin) and adipokines [adiponectin, leptin, tumour necrosis factor-Î±, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)] were also assessed. At 24 months, 37 patients had available follow-up data (RYGB, n = 18; SG, n = 19). Bariatric surgery induced type 2 diabetes remission rates of 40 and 27% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Total fat/abdominal fat loss, insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity and Î²-cell function (C-peptide0-120 /glucose0-120 Ã— Matsuda index) improved more in those with remission at 12 and 24 months than in those without remission. Incretin levels were unrelated to type 2 diabetes remission, but, compared with those without remission, hs-CRP decreased and adiponectin increased more in those with remission. Only baseline adiponectin level predicted lower HbA1c levels at 12 and 24 months, and elevated adiponectin correlated with enhanced Î²-cell function, lower triglyceride levels and fat loss. Smaller rises in adiponectin level, a mediator of insulin action and adipose mass, characterize type 2 diabetes non-remission up to 2 years after bariatric surgery. Adjunctive strategies promoting greater fat loss and/or raising adiponectin may be key to achieving higher type 2 diabetes remission rates after bariatric surgery.",10.1111/dom.12376,,,,497
321,Effect of Obesity and Roux-En-Y Gastric Surgery on Omeprazole Pharmacokinetics.,"The prevalence of obesity is increasing globally. The principal aim was to evaluate whether gastric bypass surgery modifies the bioavailability and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of omeprazole. Controlled, open-label, bioavailability clinical trial in patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Healthy patients with obesity (body mass index >35) were included and assessed for omeprazole PKs before and after RYGB (1 and 6 months). PK sampling was done at baseline and several times up to 12 h after drug dosing. Pre- and post-surgery parameters were compared using paired ANOVA or Wilcoxon tests, and control versus cases using ANOVA or Mann-Whitney tests. Given the post-surgery change in body weight, parameters were corrected by dose/body weight. Fourteen case and 24 control subjects were recruited; 92% were women (N = 35/38). In patients who underwent RYGB, maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was significantly reduced at 1 and 6 months after surgery compared with presurgery values (p = 0.001). Regarding the AUC, the values are lower at 1 and 6 months after surgery than at baseline (p < 0.001). The drug clearance was also increased in the first month after surgery. No differences were found between patients 6 months after surgery and controls. Cmax and AUC corrected by dose/body weight were significantly different between the baseline surgery subjects and controls. Discusion/Conclusions: Omeprazole bioavailability is reduced in patients with obesity at 1 and 6 months after RYGB. However, omeprazole PK parameters 6 months after RYGB are similar to control subjects, and thus no dose correction is required after RYGB for a given indication.",10.1159/000521570,,,,498
1190,"Duodenal switch versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity: systematic review and meta-analysis of weight results, diabetes resolution and early complications in single-centre comparisons.","Long-term weight loss after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in super-obese patients has not been ideal. Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (DS) is argued to be better; however, additional side effects are feared. The aim of the present study was to determine differences in results after DS and RYGB in publications from single-centre comparisons. A systematic review of studies containing DS and RYGB performed at the same centre was performed. Outcome data were weight results, resolution of comorbid conditions, perioperative results and complications. Main outcome was difference in weight loss after DS and RYGB. Secondary outcomes were difference in resolution of comorbidities, perioperative results and complications. The final analysis included 16 studies with in total 874 DS and 1,149 RYGB operations. When comparing weight results at the longest follow-up of each study, DS yielded 6.2 (95% confidence interval 5.0-7.5) body mass index units additional weight loss compared with RYGB, P < 0.001. Operative time and length of stay were significantly longer after DS, as well as the risk for post-operative leaks, P < 0.05. DS is more effective than RYGB as a weight-reducing procedure. However, this comes at the price of more early complications and might also yield slightly higher perioperative mortality.",10.1111/obr.12169,,,,499
369,Short-term changes in the serum metabolome after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Bariatric surgery is known to be the most effective treatment for weight loss in obese patients and for the rapid remission of obesity-related comorbidities. These short-term improvements result from not only limited digestion or absorption but also dynamic changes in metabolism throughout the whole body. However, short-term metabolism studies associated with bariatric surgery in Asian individuals have not been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term metabolome changes in the serum promoted by laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and to determine the underlying mechanisms that affect obesity-related comorbidities. Serum samples were collected from Korean patients who underwent RYGB or SG before and 4Â weeks after the surgery. Metabolomic and lipidomic profiling was performed using UPLC-Orbitrap-MS, and data were analyzed using statistical analysis. Metabolites mainly related to amino acids, lipids (fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, glycerolipids) and bile acids changed after surgery, and these changes were associated with the lowering of risk factors for obesity-related diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and atherosclerosis. Interestingly, the number of significantly altered metabolites related to the lipid metabolism were greater in SG than in RYGB. Furthermore, the metabolites related to amino acid metabolism were significantly changed only after SG, whereas bile acid changed significantly only following RYGB. These differences could result from anatomical differences between the two surgeries and could be related to the gut microbiota. This study provides crucial information to expand the knowledge of the common but different molecular mechanisms involved in obesity and obesity-related comorbidities affected by each bariatric procedure.",10.1007/s11306-021-01826-y,,,,500
500,Five-Year Weight Loss Outcomes in Laparoscopic Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (LVSG) Versus Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB) Procedures: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy (LVSG) has overtaken the laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) as the most frequently performed bariatric surgical procedure. To date little has been reported on the long-term outcomes of the LVSG procedure comparative to the traditionally favoured LRYGB. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to review the 5-year outcomes of comparing LVSG and LRYGB. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare 5-year weight loss outcomes of randomized controlled trials comparing LVSG to LRYGB. Searches of electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane) were undertaken for randomized controlled trials describing weight loss outcomes in adults at 5 years postoperatively. Where sufficient data was available to undertake meta-analysis, the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman estimation method for random effects model was utilized. The review was registered with PROSPERO and reported following in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Five studies met the inclusion criteria totaling 1028 patients (LVSG=520, LRYGB=508). Moderate but comparable levels of bias were observed within studies. Statistically significant body mass index loss ranged from -11.37â€‰kg/m (range: -6.3 to -15.7â€‰kg/m) in the LVSG group and -12.6â€‰kg/m (range: -9.5 to -15.4â€‰kg/m) for LRYGB at 5 years (P<0.001). Systematic review suggested that LRYGB produced a greater weight loss expressed as percent excess weight and percent excess body mass index loss than LVSG: this was not corroborated in the meta-analysis. Five year weight loss outcomes suggest both LRYGB and LVSG are effective in achieving significant weight loss at 5 years postoperatively, however, differences in reporting parameters limit the ability to reliably compare the outcomes using statistical methods. Furthermore, results may be impacted by large dropout rates and per protocol analysis of the 2 largest included studies. Further long-term studies are required to contradict or validate the results of this meta-analysis.",10.1097/SLE.0000000000000834,,,,501
909,Microvascular Outcomes after Metabolic Surgery (MOMS) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and class I obesity: rationale and design for a randomised controlled trial.,"There are several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that have already shown that metabolic/bariatric surgery achieves short-term and long-term glycaemic control while there are no level 1A of evidence data regarding the effects of surgery on the microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this trial is to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) plus the best medical treatment (BMT) versus the BMT alone to improve microvascular outcomes in patients with T2DM with a body mass index (BMI) of 30-34.9â€…kg/m2. This study design includes a unicentric randomised unblinded controlled trial. 100 patients (BMI from 30 to 34.9â€…kg/m2) will be randomly allocated to receive either RYGB plus BMT or BMT alone. The primary outcome is the change in the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) captured as the proportion of patients who achieved nephropathy remission (uACR<30â€…mg/g of albumin/mg of creatinine) in an isolated urine sample over 12, 24 and 60â€…months. The study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board. This study represents the first RCT comparing RYGB plus BMT versus BMT alone for patients with T2DM with a BMI below 35â€…kg/m2.

983,Late Postoperative Complications in Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LVSG) Versus Laparoscopic Roux-en-y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB): Meta-analysis and Systematic Review.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy (LVSG), have been proposed as cost-effective strategies to manage obesity-related chronic disease. The objectives of this meta-analysis and systematic review were to analyze the ""late postoperative complication rate (>30 days)"" for these 2 procedures. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2000 and 2015 comparing the late complication rates, that is, >30 days following LVSG and LRYGB in adult population (ie, 16 y and above) were selected from PubMed, Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, Current Contents, and the Cochrane database. The outcome variables analyzed included mortality rate, major and minor complications, and interventions required for their management and readmission rates. Random effects model was used to calculate the effect size of both binary and continuous data. Heterogeneity among the outcome variables of these trials was determined by the Cochran Q statistic and I index. The meta-analysis was prepared in accordance with the Preferred Reporting of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Six RCTs involving a total of 685 patients (LVSG, n=345; LRYGB, n=340) reported late major complications. A nonstatistical reduction in relative odds favoring the LVSG procedure was observed [odds ratio (OR), 0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.21-1.97; P=0.4]. Four RCTs representing 408 patients (LVSG, n=208; LRYGB, n=200) reported late minor complications. A nonstatistically significant reduction of 36% in relative odds favoring the LVSG procedure was observed (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.28-1.47; P=0.3). A 37% relative reduction in odds was observed in favor of the LVSG for the need for additional interventions to manage late postoperative complications that did not reach statistical significance (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.19-2.05; P=0.4). No study specifically reported readmissions required for the management of late complication. This meta-analysis and systematic review of RCTs shows that the development of late (major and minor) complications is similar between LVSG and LRYGB procedures, 6 months to 3 years postoperatively, and they do not lead to higher readmission rate or reoperation rate for either procedure. However longer-term surveillance is required to accurately describe the patterns of late complications in these patients.",10.1097/SLE.0000000000000279,,,,503
980,"H. PYLORI INFECTION, ENDOSCOPIC, HISTOLOGICAL ASPECTS AND CELL PROLIFERATION IN THE GASTRIC MUCOSA OF PATIENTS SUBMITTED TO ROUX-EN-Y GASTRIC BYPASS WITH CONTENTION RING: a cross sectional endoscopic and immunohistochemical study.","Morbid obesity treatment through vertical gastroplasty Roux-en-Y gastric bypass initially used a contention ring. However, this technique may create conditions to the development of potentially malign alterations in the gastric mucosa. Although effective and previously performed in large scale, this technique needs to be better evaluated in long-term studies regarding alterations caused in the gastric mucosa. To analyze the preoperative and postoperative endoscopic, histological and cell proliferation findings in the gastric antrum and body mucosa of patients submitted to the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with a contention ring. We retrospectively evaluated all patients submitted to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with a contention ring with more than 60 months of postoperative follow-up. We compared the preoperative (gastric antrum and body) and postoperative (gastric pouch) gastric mucosa endoscopic findings, cell proliferation index and H. pylori prevalence. We evaluated cell proliferation through Ki-67 antibody immunohistochemical expression. In the study period, 33 patients were operated with the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass using a contention ring. We found a chronic gastritis rate of 69.7% in the preoperative period (gastric antrum and body) and 84.8% in the postoperative (gastric pouch). H. pylori was present in 18.2% of patients in the preoperative period (gastric antrum and body) and in 57.5% in the postoperative (gastric pouch). Preoperative cell proliferation index was 18.1% in the gastric antrum and 16.2% in the gastric body, and 23.8% in the postoperative gastric pouch. The postoperative cell proliferation index in the gastric pouch was significantly higher (P=0.001) than in the preoperative gastric antrum and body. Higher cell proliferation index and chronic gastritis intensity were significantly associated to H. pylori presence (P=0.001 and P=0.02, respectively). After Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with contention ring, there was a higher chronic gastritis incidence and higher cell proliferation index in the gastric pouch than in the preoperative gastric antrum and body. Mucosa inflammation intensity and cell proliferation index in the postoperative gastric pouch were associated to H. pylori presence and were higher than those found in the preoperative gastric antrum and body mucosa.",10.1590/S0004-28032016000100011,,,,504
1144,Effects of gastric bypass surgery in patients with hypertension: rationale and design for a randomised controlled trial (GATEWAY study).,"Obesity and overweight are becoming progressively more prevalent worldwide and are independently associated with a significant increase in the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Systemic arterial hypertension is frequently found in association with obesity and contributes significantly to increased cardiovascular risk. We hypothesise that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, a procedure that effectively reduces body weight, can also positively impact blood pressure control in obese and hypertensive individuals. A unicentric, randomised, controlled, unblinded clinical trial. Sixty obese (body mass index between 30 and 39.9) and moderately well controlled hypertensive patients, in use of at least two antihypertensive medications at maximum doses or more than two in moderate doses, will be randomly allocated, using an online, electronic and concealed method, to receive either RYGB plus optimised clinical treatment (OCT) or OCT alone. The primary end point is the reduction of antihypertensive medication at 1 and 2 years of follow-up. Data analysis will primarily be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The study was approved by the local institutional review board that works in total compliance with the latest version of the Helsinki Declaration, the Good Clinical Practices (GCP), the 'America's Document' and the national regulatory laws.

843,Efficacy of Sleeve Gastrectomy with Duodenal-Jejunal Bypass for the Treatment of Obese Severe Diabetes Patients in Japan: a Retrospective Multicenter Study.,"The incidence of obesity with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is increasing in Japan. The main bariatric surgery procedures in Japan are laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and LSG with duodenal-jejunal bypass (LSG/DJB) because of the high incidence of gastric cancer and difficulty exploring a remnant stomach after gastric bypass. However, few studies have compared the antidiabetic effect of LSG/DJB with LSG alone. The purpose of this study is to compare the antidiabetic effect of LSG/DJB with that of LSG alone in Japanese obese diabetic patients. This was a retrospective multicenter study including 298 cases: 177 and 121 LSG and LSG/DJB cases, respectively. We investigated the antidiabetic effect of these two procedures at 12Â months after surgery. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done to evaluate the predictive factors of T2DM remission. The diabetes remission rate at 12Â months after surgery was 80.8% for LSG and 86.0% for LSG/DJB. Insulin use and HbA1c â‰¤Â 6.7% were significant predictive factors in multivariate analysis for all patients. In patients with ABCD score â‰¥Â 6, the diabetes remission rate was 94.8% and there was no difference between procedures. Only duration of diabetes and insulin use were significant predictive factors both in univariate and multivariate analyses. However, in cases with ABCD score â‰¤Â 5, the remission rate was 70.3% and procedure type was the most significant predictive factor for diabetes remission (odds ratio [OR] 5.140). Although both LSG and LSG/DJB have good antidiabetic effects in Japanese obese patients, LSG/DJB is more effective for patients with lower ABCD scores.",10.1007/s11695-017-2874-4,,,,506
215,"Early metabolomic, lipid and lipoprotein changes in response to medical and surgical therapeutic approaches to obesity.","Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and bariatric surgery have proven to be effective treatments for obesity and cardiometabolic conditions. We aimed to explore the early metabolomic changes in response to GLP-1RA (liraglutide) therapy vs. placebo and in comparison to bariatric surgery. Three clinical studies were conducted: a bariatric surgery cohort study of participants with morbid obesity who underwent either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) studied over four and twelve weeks, and two randomized placebo-controlled, crossover double blind studies of liraglutide vs. placebo administration in participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and participants with obesity studied for three and five weeks, respectively. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-derived metabolomic data were assessed in all eligible participants who completed all the scheduled in-clinic visits. The primary outcome of the study was to explore the changes of the metabolome among participants with obesity with and without T2D receiving the GLP-1RA liraglutide vs. placebo and participants with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery during the three to five-week study period. In addition, we assessed the bariatric surgery effects longitudinally over the twelve weeks of the study and the differences between the bariatric surgery subgroups on the metabolome. The trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT03851874, NCT01562678 and NCT02944500. Bariatric surgery had a more pronounced effect on weight and body mass index reduction (-14.19Â Â±Â 5.27Â kg andÂ -Â 5.19Â Â±Â 5.27, respectively, pÂ <Â 0.001 for both) and resulted in more pronounced metabolomic and lipidomic changes compared to liraglutide therapy at four weeks postoperatively. Significant changes were observed in lipoprotein parameters, inflammatory markers, ketone bodies, citrate, and branched-chain amino acids after the first three to five weeks of intervention. After adjusting for the amount of weight loss, a significant difference among the study groups remained only for acetoacetate, Î²-hydroxybutyrate, and citrate (pÂ <Â 0.05 after FDR correction). Glucose levels were significantly reduced in all intervention groups but mainly in the T2D group receiving GLP-1RA treatment. After adjusting for weight loss, only glucose levels remained significant (pÂ =Â 0.001 after FDR correction), mainly due to the glucose change in the T2D group receiving GLP-1RA. Similar results with those observed at four weeks were observed in the surgical group when delta changes at twelve weeks were assessed. Comparing the two types of bariatric surgery, an intervention effect was more pronounced in the RYGB subgroup regarding total triglycerides, triglyceride-rich lipoprotein size, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (p for intervention: 0.031, 0.028, 0.036, respectively). However, after applying FDR correction, these changes deemed to be only suggestive; only time effects remained significant with no significant changes persisting in relation to the types of bariatric surgery. The results of this study suggest that the early metabolomic, lipid and lipoprotein changes observed between liraglutide treatment and bariatric surgery are similar and result largely from the changes in patients' body weight. Specific changes observed in the short-term post-surgical period between bariatric vs. nonsurgical treated participants, i.e., acetoacetate, Î²-hydroxybutyrate, and citrate changes, may reflect changes in patient diets and calorie intake indicating potential calorie and diet-driven metabolomics/lipidomic effects in the short-term postoperatively. Significant differences observed between SG and RYGB need to be confirmed and extended by future studies.",10.1016/j.metabol.2022.155346,,,,507
1204,"A COMPARISON OF EFECTIVENESS, AND AN ASSESSMENT OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS AFTER LAPAROSCOPIC SLEEVE GASTRECTOMY AND ROUX-EN-Y GASTRIC BYPASS.","Morbid obesity is nowadays one of the major problems of well developed countries. Treatment of this disease comprises many modalities, but the most successful are surgical ones. With the advent of laparoscopic operations it became clear that these are particularly useful for operation in obese patients due to their minimal invasiveness. The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness and quality of life of patients operated on for morbid obesity by laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric by-pass (LRYGB) by one surgeon in one surgical centre. Between 2006-2011 in the Department of General and Vascular Surgery, Szczecin-Zdunowo Specialist Hospital, 74 morbidly obese patients (54 F, 20 M) were operated on by two methods. Mean age (42.4 and 45 years), and body mass index (46.5 Â± 8.9 kg/m2 for LSG and 45.1 Â± 4.4 kg/m2 for LRYGB) respectively, were comparable. One surgeon in one centre performed LSG in 33 patients (24 F, 9 M) and LRYGB in 41 patients (30 F, 11 M). An independent observer evaluated patients at times of up to 6 months (37 pts), and after 7 months to 36 months (37 pts) postoperatively. Quality of life was assessed by the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) questionnaire, with accessory questions concerning sexual, physical and other activities before and after intervention. There were no serious short or long term complications in either group of patients, although one patient in each group felt permanent postoperative discomfort (2.44% and 3.03%). Percentages of excess weight loss in both groups were similar and reached after 6 months 38.5% for LSG, 39.9% for LRYGB, and after 7-36 months 64.5% for LSG, 66.9% for LRYGB respectively. Quality of life assessment revealed significantly lower values in core symptoms for patients after LRYGB compared to LSG, but after LSG constipation was slightly more frequent. However, the general GIQLI score for patients after both types of surgery was statistically insignificant (110.6 for LSG versus 108.7 for LRYGB). In both groups sexual and physical activities significantly improved after operation. There were no significant differences in effectiveness and quality of life in patients after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric by-pass.",,,,,508
683,"Pros and cons of gastric bypass surgery in individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes: nationwide, matched, observational cohort study.","Long-term effects of gastric bypass (GBP) surgery have been presented in observational and randomised studies, but there are only limited data for persons with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) regarding postoperative complications. This is a nationwide observational study based on two quality registers in Sweden (National Diabetes Register, NDR and Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Register, SOReg) and other national databases. After merging the data, we matched individuals with T2DM who had undergone GBP with those not surgically treated for obesity on propensity score, based on sex, age, body mass index (BMI) and calendar time. The risks of postoperative outcomes (rehospitalisations) were assessed using Cox regression models. We identified 5321 patients with T2DM in the SOReg and 5321 matched controls in the NDR, aged 18-65 years, with BMI >27.5â€‰kg/mÂ² and followed for up to 9 years. We assessed risks for all-cause mortality and hospitalisations for cardiovascular disease, severe kidney disease, along with surgical and other medical conditions. The results agree with the previously suggested lower risks of all-cause mortality (49%) and cardiovascular disease (34%), and we also found positive effects for severe kidney disease but significantly increased risks (twofold to ninefold) of several short-term complications after GBP, such as abdominal pain and gastrointestinal conditions, frequently requiring surgical procedures, apart from reconstructive plastic surgery. Long-term, the risk of anaemia was 92% higher, malnutrition developed approximately three times as often, psychiatric diagnoses were 33% more frequent and alcohol abuse was three times as great as in the control group. This nationwide study confirms the benefits and describes the panorama of adverse events after bariatric surgery in persons with obesity and T2DM. Long-term postoperative monitoring and support, as better selection of patients by appropriate specialists in interdisciplinary settings, should be provided to optimise the outcomes.",10.1136/bmjopen-2018-023882,,,,509
181,Prevalence of Rhabdomyolysis Following Bariatric Surgery and its Associated Risk Factors: a Meta-Analysis.,"This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of rhabdomyolysis (RML) following bariatric surgery and potential associated factors. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL for relevant trials from database inception through August 2022. Articles were eligible for inclusion if they reported the prevalence of RML after bariatric surgery and provided at least one of the following outcome indicators: preoperative mean BMI/mean operative time for the included population. Sixteen studies with a total of 1540 patients were analyzed. The mean preoperative age distribution of the included patients was centered between 32.9 and 47.0Â years, and the mean preoperative BMI ranged from 42.3 to 60.0Â kg/m2. The operative time varied between 126.7 and 403.3Â min. The overall pooled crude prevalence of post-bariatric surgery RML was 19.4%. Subgroup analyses showed the pooled prevalence of RML was 8.1% for operative durationâ€‰>â€‰120 andâ€‰â‰¤â€‰180Â min, 32.8% forâ€‰>â€‰180 andâ€‰â‰¤â€‰240Â min, and 47.4% forâ€‰>â€‰240Â min. Meta-regression revealed that operation time was an independent risk factor for developing RML. Besides, BMIâ€‰>â€‰50Â kg/m2 and open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) indicated a higher risk of RML. Post-bariatric surgery RML prevalence occurred more frequently with the extension of the operation time. For bariatric subjects with surgery timeâ€‰>â€‰180Â min, open RYGB, or BMIâ€‰>â€‰50Â kg/m2, CKP could be routinely measured early to verify the presence of RML and to actively prevent its fatal complications.",10.1007/s11695-023-06500-x,,,,510
1380,"Roux en Y gastric bypass by single-incision mini-laparotomy: outcomes in 3,300 consecutive patients.","Although the laparoscopic technique of Roux en Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) has popularized this weight loss procedure, the costs are justifiable if outcomes are superior to the open technique. We report our results with single-incision mini-laparotomy. From June 2000 through November 2009, RYGB was performed in 3,300 consecutive patients using a 10-15-cm single-abdominal incision. Established guidelines for patient selection were followed and protocols were developed for patient education and for the prevention of perioperative complications. Weight loss (WL) over time and complications were recorded prospectively. Actual 90-day mortality was compared to that predicted by the Obesity Surgery Mortality Risk Score (OS-MRS). Eighty-four percent of patients were females with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 50 Â± 13. BMI of males was 54 Â± 9. There was a normal distribution of the WL response over 2,000 days. Complications included bleeding (1.4%), leak (1%), pulmonary embolism (0.7%), internal hernia (2.5%), and incisional hernia (5.6%). There were 1,793 Class A, 1,288 Class B, and 219 Class C patients. Eleven patients (0.3%) died within 90 days (one Class A, seven Class B, and three Class C), with mortality rates in all classes less than expected by the OS-MRS. Average hospital charges were $13,000. Our protocols and operative technique should be reproducible in other centers and may have a special appeal, if the costs of LRYGB limit access to bariatric surgery in qualified patients.",10.1007/s11695-011-0394-1,,,,511
112,Predictive factors to estimate the severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in candidates for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is related to obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome. The increasing prevalence of NAFLD results in a significant number of patients manifesting chronic liver disease over time. The aim of this study was to analyze the predictive factors to estimate NAFLD severity in patients who are candidates for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This descriptive observational study was conducted with 136 obese patients who were candidates for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and had mild, moderate, or severe NAFLD. Severe NAFLD was more prevalent among the men (PÂ =Â 0.007), and mild NAFLD was more prevalent among the women (PÂ =Â 0.007). Hyperferritinemia was observed in the group with severe NAFLD (PÂ =Â 0.01). Neck circumference and waist-to-height ratio were associated with an increased risk when comparing the groups with mild and severe NAFLD and those with moderate and severe NAFLD (PÂ =Â 0.023 and PÂ =Â 0.001, respectively); the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase ratio values were >1 (PÂ =Â 0.002) in the same comparisons. The regression analyses showed that an increase of 1 ng/mL in vitamin D reduced the chances of severe steatosis by 10% (PÂ =Â 0.043), and an increase of 1 U/L ALT increased the chances of severe steatosis by 13% (PÂ =Â 0.002). High neck circumference and low waist-to-height ratio values, male sex, hyperferritinemia, increased serum ALT values, and decreased vitamin D levels were related to the risk for severe NAFLD.",10.1016/j.nut.2023.112190,,,,512
473,Bariatric surgery during the evolution of fatty liver-A randomized clinical trial comparing gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy based on transient elastography.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely related to patients with obesity. For patients with NAFLD, bariatric surgery is the best treatment. However, the best technique to patient with severe NAFLD is still unknown. Currently available, the imaging methods for assessing and monitoring NAFLD are of limited use for diagnosing. In contrast, compared with liver biopsy and transient hepatic elastography (THE) has shown good accuracy in individuals with obesity. To prospectively compare the evolution of THE parameters of NAFLD right after the procedures: gastric bypass vs sleeve gastrectomy. Patients with obesity were randomized into two groups: gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy in a previous study. Iin a previous study one week before and three months after surgery the patients underwent evaluation by THE. The patients were also analyzed with controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), which assesses the degree of hepatic steatosis using the same device. Sleeve gastrectomy group showed a greater decrease in THE values (from 8.13 to 5.53â€‰kPa) compared to the gastric bypass group (from 9.25 to 8.81â€‰kPa; P = .004). CAP also revealed a greater decrease in sleeve subjects (from 287 to 242â€‰dB/m) compared to gastric bypass subjects (from 290 to 276â€‰dB/m; Pâ€‰<â€‰.0001). The absolute values of these differences also had a largest decrease with both methods in sleeve gastrectomy group (P = .013 and P = .005 for THE and CAP, respectively).Sleeve gastrectomy showed a greater decrease in both parameters (THE and CAP) than gastric bypass in the first months.",10.1111/cob.12393,,,,513
541,Fracture risk after three bariatric surgery procedures in Swedish obese subjects: up to 26 years follow-up of a controlled intervention study.,"Previous studies have reported an increased fracture risk after bariatric surgery. To investigate the association between different bariatric surgery procedures and fracture risk. Incidence rates and hazard ratios for fracture events were analysed in the Swedish Obese Subjects study; an ongoing, nonrandomized, prospective, controlled intervention study. Hazard ratios were adjusted for risk factors for osteoporosis and year of inclusion. Information on fracture events were captured from the Swedish National Patient Register. The current analysis includes 2007 patients treated with bariatric surgery (13.3% gastric bypass, 18.7% gastric banding, and 68.0% vertical banded gastroplasty) and 2040 control patients with obesity matched on group level based on 18 variables. Median follow-up was between 15.1 and 17.9Â years for the different treatment groups. During follow-up, the highest incidence rate for first-time fracture was observed in the gastric bypass group (22.9 per 1000 person-years). The corresponding incidence rates were 10.4, 10.7 and 9.3 per 1000 person-years for the vertical banded gastroplasty, gastric banding and control groups, respectively. The risk of fracture was increased in the gastric bypass group compared with the control group (adjusted hazard ratio [adjHR] 2.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.02-3.31; PÂ <Â 0.001), the gastric banding group (adjHR 1.99; 95%CI 1.41-2.82; PÂ <Â 0.001), and the vertical banded gastroplasty group (adjHR 2.15; 95% CI 1.66-2.79; PÂ <Â 0.001). The risk of fracture is increased after gastric bypass surgery. Our findings highlight the need for long-term follow-up of bone health for patients undergoing this treatment.",10.1111/joim.13020,,,,514
468,Effect of one-anastomosis gastric bypass on cardiovascular risk factors in patients with vitamin D deficiency and morbid obesity: A secondary analysis.,"Bariatric patients often suffer from vitamin D (VD) deficiency, and both, morbid obesity and VD deficiency, are related to an adverse effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Therefore, we assessed the change of known CVD risk factors and its associations during the first 12 months following one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). In this secondary analysis, CVD risk factors, medical history and anthropometric data were assessed in fifty VD deficient (25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) <75Â nmol/l) patients, recruited for a randomized controlled trial of VD supplementation. Based on previous results regarding bone-mass loss and the association between VD and CVD risk, the study population was divided into patients with 25(OH)D â‰¥50Â nmol/l (adequate VD group; AVD) and into those <50Â nmol/l (inadequate VD group; IVD) at 6 and 12 months (T6/12) postoperatively. In the whole cohort, substantial remission rates for hypertension (38%), diabetes (30%), and dyslipidaemia (41%) and a significant reduction in CVD risk factors were observed at T12. Changes of insulin resistance markers were associated with changes of total body fat mass (TBF%), 25(OH)D, and ferritin. Moreover, significant differences in insulin resistance markers between AVD and IVD became evident at T12. These findings show that OAGB leads to a significant reduction in CVD risk factors and amelioration of insulin resistance markers, which might be connected to reduced TBF%, change in 25(OH)D and ferritin levels, as an indicator for subclinical inflammation, and an adequate VD status.

939,Body Weight Reduction and Biochemical Parameters of the Patients After RYGB and SG Bariatric Procedures in 12-Month Observation.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y-bypass (RYGB) on anthropometric and biochemical parameters, including changes in glucose levels, lipid profile and liver function. Drastic decrease in all lipid fractions a few weeks or months after the surgery could be regarded as favourable, but low level of HDL is an independent risk factor for heart diseases. Extreme load on the liver without preparation of the patient to the surgery can have negative consequences. The test group comprised of 40 female patients at the age of 42.96 with average body weight of 131.56Â kg and BMI 46.49. Biochemical analyses were performed using calorimetric method. No statistically significant differences were observed in glucose levels between the two types of procedures. The highest differences were noted for triglycerides levels, which decreased, as well as all cholesterol fractions, after RYGB, but were increasing during the first months after SG procedure. Changes in lipid profile, caused by the reduction of all lipid fractions, were more visible after RYGB. The decrease in total cholesterol directly and activity of liver enzymes after the procedure was as higher after RYGB as after SG. Increased activity of transaminases indicates significant liver overload. With the selection of groups of patients with similar initial parameters, it is not clear whether the differences between the two procedures when assessing the improvement of glycaemia are significant. However, due to invasive character of RYGB, liver overload lasting several months and lifelong limited absorption of nutrients, the possibility of SG procedure should be considered as a first option.",10.1007/s11695-016-2400-0,,,,516
360,Operative management of recalcitrant marginal ulcers following laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity: a systematic review.,"One of the short- and long-term complications following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) for morbid obesity is the development of marginal ulcers (MUs). Although chronic and recalcitrant/recurrent marginal ulcers (rMUs) are common, there is no consensus on their optimal management. The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review of the elective operative management of rMUs. A systematic search of the literature was conducted. Relevant databases were searched up to May 16, 2020. Articles were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) bariatric patients were included as the study population, (2) laparoscopic RYGB was performed as the index operation, (3) study patients developed rMUs, and (4) MUs required elective operative (surgical, endoscopic) interventions. Quality of articles was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The search identified 3470 citations; of these, 16 observational studies were included. Elective management of rMUs consisted of endoscopic (oversewing Â± stents) and surgical interventions (gastrojejunostomy revision, vagotomy, conversion to sleeve gastrectomy, subtotal/total gastrectomy, reversal to normal anatomy). Quality of the studies as assessed by the GRADE system was low to very low. Recalcitrant/recurrent MUs are challenging complications both for bariatric patients and for their treating surgeons. There are no established algorithms for the management of rMUs, and the currently available evidence in the literature is limited both in quantity and in quality. Future multicentre, multisurgeon, randomized, controlled trials are needed to address this issue.",10.1016/j.soard.2021.07.017,,,,517
1628,Prospective comparative evaluation of stapled versus transected silastic ring gastric bypass: 6-year follow-up.,"The effect of transecting vs. stapling the stomach in continuity in the banded gastric bypass (GBP) operation was studied. 50 patients, 25 in each group, were enrolled into a prospective study to determine if transecting the stomach vs. stapling it in continuity in performing GBP for obesity decreases the incidence of gastro-gastric fistula formation without increased morbidity. The patient profiles in the 2 groups were very similar. The peri-operative complications included 1 splenic capsular injury in each group, controlled without a splenectomy. There was 1 anastomotic leak in the stapled and 1 bleeding from the cut edge of the bypassed stomach in the transected group, both requiring re-operations in the immediate postoperative period. There was no peri-operative mortality. The percent follow-up after 6 years was 80% and 88% in the stapled and transected groups respectively. The incidence of late complications of solid food intolerance, ventral incisional hernia, cholelithiasis and small bowel obstruction was similar in both groups. There were 8 gastro-gastric fistulas in the stapled group and 1 in the transected group. The reduction in body mass index and percent excess weight loss (66%) were similar in both groups. The incidence of gastro-gastric fistula may be reduced in GBP procedures by transecting the stomach as opposed to stapling it in continuity, without an increase in morbidity or mortality or any loss in the effectiveness of the operation.",10.1381/096089201321454051,,,,518
901,Chenodeoxycholic acid stimulates glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion in patients after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Postprandial secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is enhanced after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), but the precise molecular mechanisms explaining this remain poorly understood. Plasma concentrations of bile acids (BAs) increase after RYGB, and BAs may act as molecular enhancers of GLP-1 secretion through activation of TGR5-receptors. We aimed to evaluate GLP-1 secretion after oral administration of the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and the secondary bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) (which are available for oral use) in RYGB-operated participants. Eleven participants (BMI 29.1Â Â±Â 1.2, age 37.0Â Â±Â 3.2Â years, time from RYGB 32.3Â Â±Â 1.1Â months, weight loss after RYGB 37.0Â Â±Â 3.1Â kg) were studied in a placebo-controlled, crossover-study. On three different days, participants ingested (1) placebo (water), (2) UDCA 750Â mg, (3) CDCA 1250Â mg (highest recommended doses). Oral intake of CDCA increased plasma concentrations of GLP-1, C-peptide, glucagon, peptide YY, neurotensin, total bile acids, and fibroblast growth factor 19 significantly compared with placebo (all PÂ <Â 0.05 for peak and positive incremental area-under-the-curve (piAUC)). All plasma hormone concentrations were unaffected by UDCA Neither UDCA nor CDCA changed glucose, cholecystokinin or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) concentrations. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid is able to enhance secretion of gut hormones when administered orally in RYGB-operated patients-even in the absence of nutrients.",10.14814/phy2.13140,,,,519
1291,Long-term results of a randomized clinical trial comparing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with vertical banded gastroplasty.,"The long-term results of Roux-en-$\hbox{Y}$ gastric bypass (gastric bypass) and vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) from randomized studies have not been described in detail. Patients were randomized to gastric bypass or VBG. Body mass index (BMI), body composition, eating habits and gastrointestinal hormones were reviewed after 6 years. The frequency of reoperation was assessed up to 10 years after surgery. Sixty-six (80 per cent) of the 82 subjects randomized were assessed for weight and BMI 6 years after surgery, 30 (81 per cent) in the gastric bypass group and 36 (80 per cent) in the VBG group. Intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated greater weight loss after gastric bypass compared with VBG, 6 years after surgery: BMI reduced from 41Â·8 (95 per cent confidence interval 41Â·3 to 42Â·3) to 30Â·3 (28Â·6 to 32Â·0) kg/m(2) for gastric bypass and from 42Â·3 (42Â·8 to 44Â·8) to 32Â·9 (31Â·3 to 34Â·5) kg/m(2) for VBG (P = 0Â·036). Gastric bypass caused a larger loss of fat mass (P = 0Â·026) and better preservation of lean tissue (P = 0Â·009). Patients having a gastric bypass had greater postprandial responses to the satiety hormones glucagon-like peptide 1 and peptide YY (P = 0Â·003 and P = 0Â·004 respectively). Ghrelin levels did not differ between the groups. Patients with a gastric bypass maintained a lower intake of fat compared with those having VBG (P = 0Â·013). Some 89 per cent of patients who initially had VBG had undergone, or were scheduled for, conversion to gastric bypass at latest follow-up. Gastric bypass was superior to VBG regarding weight loss, body composition, dietary composition and postprandial satiety hormone responses.",10.1002/bjs.8975,,,,520
1538,Comparison of totally robotic laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and traditional laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Laparoscopic gastric bypass is a technically demanding operation, especially when hand-sewing is required. Robotics may help facilitate the performance of this difficult operation. This study was undertaken to compare a single surgeon's results using the daVinci Surgical System with those using traditional laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) when the techniques were learned simultaneously. From July 2004 to April 2005, the new laparoscopic fellow's first 50 patients were randomized to undergo either LRYGB or totally robotic laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (TRRYGB). Data were collected on patient age, gender, body mass index (BMI), co-morbidities, operative time, complication rates, and length of stay. Student's t test with unequal variances was used for statistical analysis. No significant differences in age, gender, co-morbidities, complication rates, or length of stay were found between the two groups. The mean operating time was significantly shorter for TRRYGB than for LRYGB (130.8 versus 149.4 minutes; P = 0.02), with a significant difference in minutes per BMI (2.94 versus 3.47 min/BMI; P = 0.02). The largest difference was in patients with a BMI >43 kg/m(2), for whom the difference in procedure time was 29.6 minutes (123.5 minutes for TRRYGB versus 153.2 minutes for LRYGB; P = 0.009) and a significant difference in minutes per BMI (2.49 versus 3.24 min/BMI; P = 0.009). Our data indicate that the use of the daVinci Surgical System for TRRYGB is safe and feasible. The operating room time is shorter with the use of the robotic system during a surgeon's learning curve, and that decrease is maximized in patients with a larger BMI. TRRYGB may be a better approach to gastric bypass when hand-sewing is required, especially early in a surgeon's experience.",10.1016/j.soard.2005.08.008,,,,521
415,Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: 5-year outcomes of merged data from two randomized clinical trials (SLEEVEPASS and SM-BOSS).,"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) are both effective surgical procedures to achieve weight reduction in patients with obesity. The trial objective was to merge individual-patient data from two RCTs to compare outcomes after LSG and LRYGB. Five-year outcomes of the Finnish SLEEVEPASS and Swiss SM-BOSS RCTs comparing LSG with LRYGB were analysed. Both original trials were designed to evaluate weight loss. Additional patient-level data on type 2 diabetes (T2DM), obstructive sleep apnoea, and complications were retrieved. The primary outcome was percentage excess BMI loss (%EBMIL). Secondary predefined outcomes in both trials included total weight loss, remission of co-morbidities, improvement in quality of life (QoL), and overall morbidity. At baseline, 228 LSG and 229 LRYGB procedures were performed. Five-year follow-up was available for 199 of 228 patients (87.3 per cent) after LSG and 199 of 229 (87.1 per cent) after LRYGB. Model-based mean estimate of %EBMIL was 7.0 (95 per cent c.i. 3.5 to 10.5) percentage points better after LRYGB than after LSGÂ  (62.7 versus 55.5 per cent respectively; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). There was no difference in remission of T2DM, obstructive sleep apnoea or QoL improvement; remission for hypertension was better after LRYGB compared with LSG (60.3 versus 44.9 per cent; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.049). The complication rate was higher after LRYGB than LSG (37.2 versus 22.5 per cent; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001), but there was no difference in mean Comprehensive Complication Index value (30.6 versus 31.0 points; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.859). Although LRYGB induced greater weight loss and better amelioration of hypertension than LSG, there was no difference in remission of T2DM, obstructive sleep apnoea, or QoL at 5 years. There were more complications after LRYGB, but the individual burden for patients with complications was similar after both operations.",10.1093/bjs/znaa011,,,,522
917,Randomized trial of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus sleeve gastrectomy in achieving excess weight loss.,"Robust data on quality of life (QoL) after different techniques of bariatric surgery are sparse. This RCT compared excess weight loss (EWL) and QoL after sleeve gastrectomy versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Obese patients were assigned randomly to RYGB or sleeve gastrectomy. The primary outcome measure was EWL. Secondary outcomes included QoL, co-morbidity, adverse events, vitamin and glycolipid status. QoL was assessed before and annually after surgery, using the Moorehead-Ardelt Quality of Life Questionnaire II (M-A-QoLQII) and Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI). One hundred patients were enrolled, 45 in the RYGB group and 55 in the sleeve gastrectomy group. Mean postoperative EWL at 1, 2, 3 and 5â€‰years was 80Â·4, 79Â·8, 83Â·0 and 74Â·8 per cent respectively after RYGB, and 83Â·0, 77Â·8, 66Â·3 and 65Â·1 per cent after sleeve gastrectomy (Pâ€‰=â€‰0Â·017). Mean M-A-QoLQII score before surgery and at 1, 2, 3 and 5â€‰years after operation was 0Â·5, 1Â·6, 1Â·7, 2Â·1 and 1Â·4 respectively after RYGB, and 0Â·3, 1Â·7, 1Â·5, 1Â·5 and 1Â·2 after sleeve gastrectomy. Mean GIQLI score before and at 1, 2, 3, 5â€‰years after RYGB was 96Â·4, 113Â·8, 113Â·3, 113Â·4, 111Â·7, compared with 90Â·7, 113Â·9, 114Â·5, 113Â·1 and 113Â·0 for sleeve gastrectomy. The improvement was significant compared with preoperative values (Pâ€‰<â€‰0Â·001 for M-A-QoLQII and GIQLI), with no difference between groups (Pâ€‰=â€‰0Â·418 and Pâ€‰=â€‰0Â·323 respectively). RYGB resulted in higher readmission rates (Pâ€‰=â€‰0Â·002) and length of hospital stay (Pâ€‰=â€‰0Â·006) than sleeve gastrectomy. RYGB and sleeve gastrectomy resulted in equivalent, long-standing QoL improvement. RYGB resulted in more stable weight loss but was associated with higher readmission rates.

947,Predictive Value of C-Reactive Protein for Complications Post-Laparoscopic Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass.,"Laparoscopic roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) has gained increasing popularity as the primary procedure of choice for the management of patients with morbid obesity. Despite the advances, a few patients will still develop complications and predicting these early complications in morbidly obese patients can prove to be difficult. Radiological investigations have limited diagnostic value and have associated side effects and cost. We propose that C-reactive protein (CRP) is a useful predictor for early postoperative complications. This study aims to determine the ability of CRP taken on postoperative day 1 (POD 1) and 2 to predict occurrence of complications within 30Â days of surgery. This retrospective observational study selected 183 consecutive patients from the York bariatric database between 01 December 2010 and 23 March 2015. Patients undergoing dual procedures, conversion to open, and if no postoperative CRP measurement was performed. In total, 138 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria during the study period (median age 44Â years [20-68], BMI 50.6Â kg/m2 [38.3-62.5]). Fifteen (10.8Â %) patients had minor complications (CD of 2) and 8 (5.6Â %) had major complications (CD 3 or above). A CRP of greater than 127Â mg/L on POD 2 was found to predict complications with 93Â % sensitivity and 64Â % specificity with diagnostic accuracy 0.82 (95Â % confidence interval 0.731-0.908). In our patients, CRP on POD 2 has been shown to be a good predictor of both minor and major complications and can therefore be used to guide clinicians in making decision as to which patients may need further investigation or who can be safely discharged.",10.1007/s11695-016-2349-z,,,,524
432,Association of Gastric Bypass Surgery With Risk of Developing Diabetic Retinopathy Among Patients With Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes in Sweden: An Observational Study.,"Knowledge of the incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) after gastric bypass surgery (GBP) in patients with obesity and diabetes could guide the management of these patients. To investigate the incidence of diabetic ocular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes after GBP compared with the incidence of diabetic ocular complications in a matched cohort of patients with obesity and diabetes who have not undergone GBP. Data from 2 nationwide registers in Sweden, the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry and the National Diabetes Register, were used for this cohort study. A total of 5321 patients with diabetes from the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry who had undergone GBP from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2013, were matched with 5321 patients with diabetes from the National Diabetes Register who had not undergone GBP, based on sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and calendar time (2007-2013). Follow-up data were obtained until December 31, 2015. Statistical analysis was performed from October 5, 2018, to September 30, 2019. Gastric bypass surgery. Incidence of new DR and other diabetic ocular complications. The study population consisted of 5321 patients who had undergone GBP (3223 women [60.6%]; mean [SD] age, 49.0 [9.5] years) and 5321 matched controls (3395 women [63.8%]; mean [SD] age, 47.1 [11.5] years). Mean (SD) follow-up was 4.5 (1.6) years. The mean (SD) BMI and hemoglobin A1c concentration at baseline were 42.0 (5.7) and 7.6% (1.5%), respectively, in the GBP group and 40.9 (7.3) and 7.5% (1.5%), respectively, in the control group. The mean (SD) duration of diabetes was 6.8 (6.3) years in the GBP group and 6.4 (6.4) years in the control group. The risk for new DR was reduced in the patients who underwent GBP (hazard ratio, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.49-0.78]; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). The dominant risk factors for development of DR at baseline were diabetes duration, hemoglobin A1c concentration, use of insulin, glomerular filtration rate, and BMI. This nationwide matched cohort study suggests that there is a reduced risk of developing new DR associated with GBP, and no evidence of an increased risk of developing DR that threatened sight or required treatment.",10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2020.5892,,,,525
442,Image-Guided Surgery for Common Bile Duct Stones After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.,"Background: The relationship between obesity with common bile duct stone (CBDS) is close and increases after a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Due to the anatomical modification, direct endoscopic access is not always possible. For this reason, image-guided surgery (IGS) by percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) of the common bile duct (CBD) could be a first-line approach for the treatment of post-RYGB choledocholithiasis. The aim of this study was to analyze the feasibility and safety of CBDS treatment after RYGB with IGS. Materials and Methods: We present a descriptive retrospective observational multicentric study on the treatment of choledocholithiasis in patients operated on for RYGB using IGS through a minimally invasive approach by PTBD. The diagnosis of CBDS was made according to the symptoms of the patients, supported by blood tests, and medical images. Treatment was planned in two stages: in the first step, a PTBD was performed, and in the second step the choledocholithiasis was removed. Results: Of a total of 1403 post-RYGB patients, 21 presented choledocholithiasis. Of these, nâ€‰=â€‰18 were included. Symptoms were reported in nâ€‰=â€‰15 (8 cholestatic jaundice, 7 cholangitis), whereas nâ€‰=â€‰3 were asymptomatic. Percutaneous treatment was performed in all these patients, treated with a balloon and stone basket. A hyperamylasemia without pancreatitis was observed in 3 patients. No complications or deaths associated with the procedure were reported. The average hospital stay was 8.6 days. Conclusion: IGS is an interesting option for the treatment CBDS after RYGB. For these patients, PTBD is feasible and safe.",10.1089/lap.2020.0842,,,,526
1230,Effect of gastric bypass versus diet on cardiovascular risk factors.,"To assess the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration and its apolipoprotein A4 (ApoA4) content at 1 year after bariatric surgery in comparison with a hypocaloric diet. Secondary aim was to measure total cholesterol and triglycerides levels and insulin sensitivity after interventions. Very few prospective uncontrolled studies have investigated the effects of RYGB on cardiovascular risk factors. No controlled studies had as primary goal the changes in HDL-C after gastric bypass. Forty subjects with a body mass index more than 40 or 35 kg/m or more in the presence of diabetes were enrolled. Twenty of them underwent RYGB, whereas 20 received lifestyle modification suggestions and medical therapy for obesity complications (diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia). A significant (P < 0.0001) increase in HDL-C concentrations was observed only in the surgical arm (from 41.95 Â± 7.24 to 56.55 Â± 9.01 mg/dL). Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced (P < 0.0001) in both groups with no between-group differences, probably in relation to the optimization of the antihypertensive treatment. Plasma concentration of ApoA4, a major HDL-C protein fraction, significantly increased 1 year after RYGB (from 496.61 Â± 400.41 to 987.88 Â± 637.41Î¼g/L, P < 0.01). Circulating triglycerides concentration significantly decreased after surgery, whereas both peripheral and hepatic insulin resistance increased significantly. Our study shows that HDL-C and ApoA4 significantly increase after gastric bypass and that this increase is associated with a net improvement in hepatic insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, we speculate that ApoA4, which induces satiety in animals, can eventually play a role on the appetite reduction after RYGB because there is a strict and inverse relationship between weight and ApoA4 changes.

808,Intraoperative endoscopy prevents technical defect related leaks in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: A randomized control trial.,"Postoperative anastomotic leaks, bleeding and stenosis are major causes of morbidity after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). Retrospective studies suggest that intraoperative endoscopy reduces the incidence of these complications. We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial in a single institution between March 2013 and January 2016. Patients were assigned to one of two groups: LRYGB with Intraoperative Endoscopy (IOE) or LRYGB without IOE. Patient selection criteria were morbidly obese patients, 18 years or older who were candidates to LRYGB. The primary outcome was the frequency of technical defect related anastomotic leaks. Secondary outcomes were operative time, length of hospital stay, anastomotic related complications, reoperations and 30-day mortality. 50 patients were randomly assigned in the IOE group and 50 in the control group. The IOE group had statistically significant lower rate of anastomotic leak (0 vs. 8%, pâ€¯=â€¯.0412), and lower need for reoperation (0 vs. 8%, pâ€¯=â€¯.0412). The IOE group had longer operative time (194.10 vs. 159 min, pâ€¯<â€¯.001), and shorter mean length of hospital stay (2.44 vs. 3.46 days, pâ€¯=â€¯.025). No differences were found in the rate of bleeding of the anastomosis, narrow anastomosis and 30-day mortality. This study specifically provides evidence that air leak test performed by intraoperative endoscopy is superior to simple visual inspection in preventing technical defect related leaks after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.",10.1016/j.ijsu.2017.12.024,,,,528
1044,"Effects of RYGB on energy expenditure, appetite and glycaemic control: a randomized controlled clinical trial.","Increased energy expenditure (EE) has been proposed as an important mechanism for weight loss following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). However, this has never been investigated in a controlled setting independent of changes in energy balance. Similarly, only few studies have investigated the effect of RYGB on glycaemic control per se. Here, we investigated the effect of RYGB on EE, appetite, glycaemic control and specific signalling molecules compared with a control group in comparable negative energy balance. Obese normal glucose-tolerant participants were randomized to receive RYGB after 8 (n=14) or 12 weeks (n=14). The protocol included a visit at week 0 and three visits (weeks 7, 11 and 78) where 24-h EE, appetite and blood parameters were assessed. Participants followed a low-calorie diet from weeks 0-11, with those operated at week 12 serving as a control group for those operated at week 8. Compared with controls, RYGB-operated participants had lower body composition-adjusted 24-h EE and basal EE 3 weeks postoperatively (both P<0.05) but EE parameters at week 78 were not different from preoperative values (week 7). Surgery changed the postprandial response of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide YY3-36 (PYY), ghrelin, cholecystokinin, fibroblast growth factor-19 and bile acids (all P<0.05). Particularly, increases in GLP-1, PYY and decreases in ghrelin were associated with decreased appetite. None of HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance), Matsuda index, the insulinogenic index, the disposition index and fasting hepatic insulin clearance were different between the groups, but RYGB operated had lower fasting glucose (P<0.05) and the postprandial glucose profile was shifted to the left (P<0.01). Our data do not support that EE is increased after RYGB. More likely, RYGB promotes weight loss by reducing appetite, partly mediated by changes in gastrointestinal hormone secretion. Furthermore, we found that the early changes in glycaemic control after RYGB is to a large extent mediated by caloric restriction.",10.1038/ijo.2015.162,,,,529
713,"Predictors of glycemic control after sleeve gastrectomy versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: A meta-analysis, meta-regression, and systematic review.","Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) are the most commonly performed bariatric procedures globally. However, it remains controversial which procedure provides better glycemic control. To identify predictors of glycemic control after SG versus RYGB, a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library was conducted up to January 2017 for comparative studies with both SG and RYGB arms for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). A meta-analysis and systematic review was performed to evaluate glycemic control after SG versus RYGB with both short- and long-term follow-up. A meta-regression was performed to evaluate impacts of clinical indicators on glycemic control after SG versus RYGB. A total of 17 comparative studies involving 1160 patients were included. SG and RYGB achieved similar diabetic remission rates with both short- and long-term follow-up. However, SG provided lower endpoint glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) after 1-year follow-up (mean deviationâ€¯=â€¯.17, 95% confidence interval .03-.31, Pâ€¯=â€¯.02). When adjusted by baseline A1C, SG and RYGB provided similar percent delta A1C with 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year follow-up. The baseline body mass index, duration of T2D, preoperative fasting plasma glucose, and preoperative A1C had predictive value for glycemic control after SG, but only duration of T2D and preoperative A1C were correlated with that after RYGB. These findings showed that the choice of procedure between SG and RYGB predicts no better glycemic control. However, more factors should be considered when SG is recommended to a given patient with diabetes.",10.1016/j.soard.2018.08.027,,,,530
273,Effect of Banded Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Versus Sleeve Gastrectomy on Diabetes Remission at 5 Years Among Patients With Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes: A Blinded Randomized Clinical Trial.,"To determine whether silastic ring laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (SR-LRYGB) or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) produces superior diabetes remission at 5 years. In a single-center, double-blind trial, 114 adults with type 2 diabetes and BMI 35-65 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to SR-LRYGB or LSG (1:1; stratified by age-group, BMI group, ethnicity, diabetes duration, and insulin therapy) using a web-based service. Diabetes and other metabolic medications were adjusted according to a prespecified protocol. The primary outcome was diabetes remission assessed at 5 years, defined by HbA1c <6% (42 mmol/mol) without glucose-lowering medications. Secondary outcomes included changes in weight, cardiometabolic risk factors, quality of life, and adverse events. Diabetes remission after SR-LRYGB versus LSG occurred in 25 (47%) of 53 vs. 18 (33%) of 55 patients (adjusted odds ratios 4.5 [95% CI 1.6, 15.5; P = 0.009] and 4.2 [1.3, 13.4; P = 0.015] in the intention-to-treat analysis). Percent body weight loss was greater after SR-LRYGB than after LSG (absolute difference 10.7%; 95% CI 7.3, 14.0; P < 0.001). Improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors were similar, but HDL cholesterol increased more after SR-LRYGB. Early and late complications were similar in both groups. General health and physical functioning improved after both types of surgery, with greater improvement in physical functioning after SR-LRYGB. People of MÄori or Pacific ethnicity (26%) had lower incidence of diabetes remission than those of New Zealand European or other ethnicities (2 of 25 vs. 41 of 83; P < 0.001). SR-LRYGB provided superior diabetes remission and weight loss compared with LSG at 5 years, with similar low risks of complications.",10.2337/dc21-2498,,,,531
958,Physical Activity in Obese Type 2 Diabetes After Gastric Bypass or Medical Management.,"The purpose of this study was to compare effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus a multidisciplinary, group-based medical diabetes and weight management program on physical fitness and behaviors. Physical behavior and fitness were assessed in participants of the study Surgery or Lifestyle With Intensive Medical Management in the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SLIMM-T2D) (NCT01073020), a randomized, parallel-group trial conducted at a US academic hospital and diabetes clinic with 18- to 24-month follow-up. Thirty-eight type 2 diabetes patients with hemoglobin A1c â‰¥6.5% and body mass index 30-42 kg/m2 were randomized to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or the medical program. A 6-minute walk test to evaluate fitness, self-reported physical activity, standardized physical surveys, and cardiometabolic risk assessment were performed at baseline and after intervention. Both groups similarly improved 6-minute walk test distance, with greater improvements in oxygen saturation and reduced heart rate after surgery. Self-reported physical activity improved similarly at 18-24 months after interventions, although exercise increased gradually after surgery, whereas early substantial increases in the medical group were not fully sustained. Self-reported total and physical health were similar by Short Form-36 but improved more in the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life survey after surgery. Improvement in cardiovascular risk scores, HbA1c, and body mass index were greater after surgery. In this small, randomized study, both interventions led to therapeutic lifestyle changes and improved objective and self-reported physical fitness. Greater improvements in heart rate, oxygen saturation, and perceived impact of weight on health were seen after surgery, which could be attributable to greater weight loss. The clinical importance of these improvements with greater weight loss warrants further investigation.",10.1016/j.amjmed.2016.07.019,,,,532
642,Trocar site closure with a novel anchor-based (neoCloseÂ®) system versus standard suture closure: a prospective randomized controlled trial.,"Patients with obesity have a higher risk of trocar site hernia. The objective of the present study was to compare a standard suture passer versus the neoCloseÂ® device for port site fascial closure in patients with obesity undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery. This is a randomized, controlled trial with two parallel arms. Thirty five patients with BMIâ€‰â‰¥â€‰35Â kg/m2 and undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were randomized to each group. Port site fascial closure for trocarsâ€‰â‰¥â€‰10Â mm was performed with the neoCloseÂ® device in the study group and the standard suture passer in the control group. Primary outcomes were time required to complete closure and intensity of postoperative pain at the fascial closure sites. Secondary outcomes were intraabdominal needle depth and incidence of trocar site hernia. The use of the neoCloseÂ® device resulted in shorter closure times (20.2 vs 30.0Â s, pâ€‰=â€‰0.0002), less pain (0.3 vs 0.9, pâ€‰=â€‰0.002) at port closure sites, and decreased needle depth (3.3Â cm vs 5.2Â cm, pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001) compared to the standard suture passer. There was no trocar site hernia at the one-year follow-up in either group. Use of the neoCloseÂ® device resulted in faster fascial closure times, decreased intraoperative needle depth, and decreased postoperative abdominal pain at 1Â week as compared to the standard suture passer. These data need to be confirmed on larger cohorts of patients with longer follow-up.",10.1007/s00464-019-06891-y,,,,533

1535,Randomized clinical trial of postoperative hernia prophylaxis in open bariatric surgery.,"Postoperative hernia following bariatric procedures is more common than in other groups of surgical patients, and remains a serious problem. Gastric bypass is the most often performed bariatric procedure and, despite the increasing popularity of a laparoscopic approach, many morbidly obese patients are still offered open procedures. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of prophylactic polypropylene mesh in morbidly obese patients undergoing gastric by-pass surgery. The study randomized 74 patients undergoing open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass into two groups: wound closure with (n = 36) or without (n = 38) a polypropylene mesh. Mean(s.d.) body mass and body mass index in the mesh group were 137.3(24.5) kg and 46.2(7.1) kg/m(2) and in the non-mesh group were 139.0(24.9) kg and 46.8(7.6) kg/m(2) respectively. In the non-mesh group, the wound was closed with a polypropylene suture. Patients in the mesh group had in addition a polypropylene mesh inserted in a sublay manner. Patients were followed up for at least 6 (range 6-38) months. Hernia developed in eight patients in the non-mesh group but in none in the mesh group. The duration of hospital stay was similar in both groups: mean(s.d.) 8.4(3.2) and 10.3(5.9) days (P = 0.092). There were no serious complications in either group. The use of a mesh prevented hernia development and did not lengthen hospital stay.",10.1002/bjs.5512,,,,535
1403,Systematic review and meta-analysis of intraperitoneal local anaesthetic for pain reduction after laparoscopic gastric procedures.,"With the advent of minimally invasive gastric surgery, visceral nociception has become an important area of investigation as a potential cause of postoperative pain. A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out to investigate the clinical effects of intraperitoneal local anaesthetic (IPLA) in laparoscopic gastric procedures. Comprehensive searches were conducted independently without language restriction. Studies were identified from the following databases from inception to February 2010: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase and CINAHL. Relevant meeting abstracts and reference lists were searched manually. Appropriate methodology according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was adhered to. Five randomized controlled trials in laparoscopic gastric procedures were identified for review. There was no significant heterogeneity between the trials (Ï‡(2) = 10Â·27, 10 d.f., P = 0Â·42, I(2) = 3 per cent). Based on meta-analysis of trials, there appeared to be reduced abdominal pain intensity (overall mean difference in pain score -1Â·64, 95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) -2Â·09 to -1Â·19; P < 0Â·001), incidence of shoulder tip pain (overall odds ratio 0Â·15, 95 per cent c.i. 0Â·05 to 0Â·44; P < 0Â·001) and opioid use (overall mean difference -3Â·23, -4Â·81 to -1Â·66; P < 0Â·001). There is evidence in favour of IPLA in laparoscopic gastric procedures for reduction of abdominal pain intensity, incidence of shoulder pain and postoperative opioid consumption.",10.1002/bjs.7293,,,,536
1223,Laparoscopic gastric banding outcomes do not depend on device or technique. long-term results of a prospective randomized study comparing the LapbandÂ® and the SAGBÂ®.,"Gastric banding still represents one of the most widely used bariatric procedures. It provides acceptable weight loss in many patients, but has frequent long-term complications. Because different types of bands may lead to different results, we designed a randomized study to compare the LapbandÂ® with the SAGBÂ®. We hereby report on the long-term results. Between December 1998 and June 2002, 180 morbidly obese patients were randomized between LapbandÂ® or SAGBÂ®. Weight loss, long-term morbidity, and need for reoperation were evaluated. Long-term weight loss did not differ between the two bands. Patients who maintained their band had an acceptable long-term weight loss of between 50 and 60 % EBMIL. In both groups, about half the patients developed long-term complications, with about 50 % requiring major redo surgery. There was no difference in the overall rates of long-term complications or failures between the two groups, but patients who had a LapbandÂ® were significantly more prone to develop band slippage/pouch dilatation (13.3 versus 0 %, p < 0,001). Although in the absence of complication, gastric banding leads to acceptable weight loss; the long-term complication and major reoperation rates are very high independently from the type of band used or on the operative technique. Gastric banding leads to relatively poor overall long-term results and therefore should not be considered the procedure of choice for the treatment of morbid obesity. Patients should be informed of the limited overall weight loss and the very high complication rates.",10.1007/s11695-013-1074-0,,,,537
439,Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Increases Glycemic Variability and Time in Hypoglycemia in Patients With Obesity and Prediabetes or Type 2 Diabetes: A Prospective Cohort Study.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is an established treatment for type 2 diabetes and obesity. The study objective was to establish RYGB's effects on glycemic variability (GV) and hypoglycemia. This was a prospective observational study of 10 participants with obesity and prediabetes or type 2 diabetes who underwent RYGB. Patients were studied before RYGB (Pre) and 1 month, 1 year, and 2 years postsurgery with continuous glucose measurement (CGM). A mixed-meal test (MMT) was conducted at Pre, 1 month, and 1 year. After RYGB, mean CGM decreased (at 1 month, 1 year, and 2 years), and GV increased (at 1 year and 2 years). Five of the 10 participants had a percent time in range (%TIR) <3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) greater than the international consensus target of 1% at 1 or 2 years. Peak glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucagon area under the curve during MMT were positively and negatively associated, respectively, with contemporaneous %TIR <3.0 mmol/L. Patients undergoing RYGB are at risk for development of postbariatric hypoglycemia due to a combination of reduced mean glucose, increased GV, and increased GLP-1 response.",10.2337/dc20-1609,,,,538
748,"Design of the Weight-loss Endoscopy Trial (WET): a multi-center, randomized, controlled trial comparing weight loss in endoscopically implanted duodenal-jejunal bypass liners vs. intragastric balloons vs. a sham procedure.","Obesity is a global problem leading to reduced life expectancy, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and many types of cancer. Even people willing to accept treatment only achieve a mean weight loss of about 5Â kg using commercial weight loss programs. Surgical interventions, e.g. sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass are effective but accompanied by risk of serious complications and side effects. Less invasive endoscopic procedures mainly comprise the intragastric balloon (IB) and the duodenal-jejunal bypass liner (DJBL). To date, a randomized comparison between these devices has not been undertaken or shown to be superior to a sham procedure. We designed a multi-center, randomized, patient and assessor-blinded, controlled trial comparing weight loss in endoscopically implanted IB vs. DJBL vs. a sham procedure. A total of 150 patients with a BMIâ€‰>â€‰35Â kg/m2 orâ€‰>â€‰30 with obesity-related comorbidities and indication for proton pump inhibitors are randomized to receive either IB, DJBL or a sham gastroscopy (2:2:1 ratio). All participants undergo regular dietary consultation. The IB will be removed after 6Â months, whereas the DJBL will be explanted after 12Â months. All patients will receive gastroscopies at implantation and explantation of the devices or sedation without gastroscopy to maintain blinding. Main exclusion criteria are malignant diseases, peptic ulcer or previous bariatric intervention. Weight loss 12Â months after explantation of the devices, changes in comorbidities, quality of life, complication rates and safety will be evaluated. This trial could help to identify the most effective and safest endoscopic device, thus determining the new standard procedure for endoscopic bariatric treatment. 16th January 2017. DRKS00011036.

1227,"Response to glucose tolerance testing and solid high carbohydrate challenge: comparison between Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, vertical sleeve gastrectomy, and duodenal switch.","Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is common after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and may result in weight regain. The purpose of our investigation was to compare the effect of RYGB, vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), and duodenal switch (DS) on insulin and glucose response to carbohydrate challenge. Patients meeting National Institutes of Health criteria for bariatric surgery selected their bariatric procedure after evaluation and education in this prospective nonrandomized study. Preoperatively and at 6, 9, and 12 months' follow-up, patients underwent blood draw to determine levels of fasting glucose, fasting insulin, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), C-peptide, and 2-h oral glucose challenge test. Homoeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA)-IR, fasting to 1-h and 1- to 2-h ratios of glucose and insulin, were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Student's paired t test. All procedures were performed via a laparoscopic technique at a single institution. Data from a total of 38 patients (13 RYGB, 12 VSG, 13 DS) were available for analysis. At baseline, all groups were similar; the only statistically significant difference was that DS patients had a higher preoperative weight and body mass index (BMI). All operations caused weight loss (BMI 47.7 Â± 10-30.7 Â± 6.4 kg/m(2) in RYGB; 45.7 Â± 8.5-31.1 Â± 5.5 kg/m(2) in VSG; 55.9 Â± 11.4-27.5 Â± 5.6 kg/m(2) in DS), reduction of fasting glucose, and improved insulin sensitivity. RYGB patients had a rapid rise in glucose with an accompanying rise in 1-h insulin to a level that exceeded preoperative levels. This was followed by a rapid decrease in glucose level. In comparison, DS patients had a lower increase in glucose and 1-h insulin, and the lowest HbA1c. These differences were statistically significant at various data points. For VSG, the results were intermediary. Compared to gastric bypass, DS results in greater weight loss and improves insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis without causing a hyperinsulinemic response. Because the response to challenge after VSG is intermediary, pyloric preservation alone cannot account for this difference.",10.1007/s00464-013-3176-0,,,,540
1309,Randomized controlled trial comparing three methods of liver retraction in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"This study aimed to evaluate differences between three methods of liver retraction during laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric bypass (LRYGB) and to compare novel liver retraction techniques with the traditional mechanical liver retractor in a randomized controlled trial. In this study, 60 obese patients (26 males and 34 females) who underwent LRYGB between January and July 2010 were randomized to one of three groups (20 in each): group 1 (Nathanson liver retractor), group 2 (liver suspension tape), and group 3 (V-shaped liver suspension technique [V-LIST]). Data regarding demographics (age, sex, body mass index); liver function test (LFT) just before surgery; postoperative results immediately, then 18 h, 1 week, and 1 month after surgery; operative data, and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain on postoperative days (PODs) 1 and 2 were calculated and analyzed. The groups did not differ significantly in terms of preoperative LFT or operative data except that group 3 took significantly longer time for liver suspension than group 1 (p = 0.01) or group 2 (p = 0.03). The VAS score in group 2 was significantly lower on POD 1 than in group 1 (p = 0.04). Group 1 showed a significant rise in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 18 h compared with group 2 (p < 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively) and group 3 (p < 0.01 and p = 0.01), at 1 week compared with group 2 (p = 0.04 and 0.04), and in AST levels alone during the immediate postoperative compared with group 3 (p = 0.04). The Nathanson liver retractor causes more liver dysfunction than V-LIST or the liver suspension technique and causes more postoperative pain than the liver suspension technique. Both V-LIST and liver suspension tape have a short learning curve and implications for single-port surgery.",10.1007/s00464-012-2438-6,,,,541
881,Analyzing the Effects of Psychotherapy on Weight Loss after Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass or Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding in Patients with Borderline Personality Disorder: A Prospective Study.,"Personality disorders are frequently associated with eating disorders in obese patients and may negatively affect weight loss and maintenance after bariatric surgery. This non-randomized study aimed to assess the effects of different psychotherapeutic interventions on weight loss in a sample of patients with borderline personality disorder who underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. A total of 153 bariatric patients meeting borderline personality disorder criteria were chosen voluntarily and consecutively to undergo an interpersonal individual treatment (n = 50), a dialectical behavioral group treatment (n = 50), or treatment as usual (n = 53) for a year after surgery. Their body mass index was measured before and at the end of each treatment. A total of 12 patients (7.8%) dropped out of the study. Significantly higher body mass index reductions were registered in both experimental groups (-14.2 and -9.4 kg/m2, respectively) compared with the treatment as usual group (-2.1 kg/m2; p < 0.01). Treated patients who underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass (total n = 94) showed better outcomes than those who underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (total n = 45), while no differences were observed in untreated patients. This study demonstrates the role of pre-operative psychological assessment and post-operative psychotherapeutic support in improving weight loss among bariatric patients with borderline personality disorder. A randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm these preliminary findings.",10.1177/1457496917701670,,,,542

It can be surgically managed by open or laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy. This study aimed to compare the results of open and laparoscopic palliative gastrojejunostomy for patients with gastric outlet obstruction resulting from inoperable neoplasms. A total of 24 patients were randomized prospectively to undergo laparoscopic (12 patients) or open (12 patients) palliative laterolateral antecolic isoperistaltic gastrojejunostomy. All the procedures were completed as planned. The mean duration of surgery was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.75). The mean intraoperative blood loss was significantly less after laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy (LGJ) (p = 0.0001). Time to oral solid food intake was longer after open gastrojejunostomy (OGJ) (p = 0.04). Two patients in the OGJ group experienced postoperative delayed gastric empting, whereas no patients in the LGJ group experienced such a complication (p = 0.04). The mean postoperative stay was shorter in the LGJ group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.65). No readmissions were registered after a minimum follow-up period of 2 months. The findings show that LGJ is a safe, feasible, and effective alternative to OGJ. However, because the current data involved only a small number of patients, large studies still are required for further evaluation of the this operation's effectiveness.",10.1007/s00464-005-0454-5,,,,543

Rapid weight loss is a major risk factor for gallstone development. Approximately 11 % of patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass develop symptomatic gallstone disease. Gallstone disease can lead to severe complications and often requires hospitalization and surgery. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) prevents the formation of gallstones after bariatric surgery. However, randomized controlled trials with symptomatic gallstone disease as primary endpoint have not been conducted. Currently, major guidelines make no definite statement about postoperative UDCA prophylaxis and most bariatric centers do not prescribe UDCA. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind multicenter trial will be performed for which 980 patients will be included. The study population consists of consecutive patients scheduled to undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy in three bariatric centers in the Netherlands. Patients will undergo a preoperative ultrasound and randomization will be stratified for pre-existing gallstones and for type of surgery. The intervention group will receive UDCA 900Â mg once daily for six months. The placebo group will receive similar-looking placebo tablets. The primary endpoint is symptomatic gallstone disease after 24Â months, defined as admission or hospital visit for symptomatic gallstone disease. Secondary endpoints consist of the development of gallstones on ultrasound at 24Â months, number of cholecystectomies, side-effects of UDCA and quality of life. Furthermore, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and budget impact analyses will be performed. The UPGRADE trial will answer the question whether UDCA reduces the incidence of symptomatic gallstone disease after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. Furthermore it will determine if treatment with UDCA is cost-effective. Netherlands Trial Register (trialregister.nl) 6135 . Date registered: 21-Nov-2016.",10.1186/s12876-017-0674-x,,,,544
1358,"Effective palliation and quality of life outcomes in studies of surgery for advanced, non-curative gastric cancer: a systematic review.","Relief of symptoms should be the primary focus of palliative treatment as defined by the World Health Organization. Evaluating the effectiveness of palliative interventions should incorporate this goal and include quality of life (QOL) outcome assessments. A systematic review of the surgical gastric cancer literature was performed to summarize the effectiveness of palliative surgical interventions in addressing QOL. An electronic literature search of EMBASE, Medline, and the Cochrane Database of Controlled Trials was performed from January 1, 1985 to December 1, 2009. English language abstracts and articles were reviewed independently by two reviewers. A systematic approach to data abstraction and presentation was followed. No articles were identified as reporting true QOL outcomes using reliable, validated QOL instruments in surgically managed, advanced gastric cancer patients. Nine articles were identified as reporting outcomes measuring effectiveness of palliation. Commonly reported pre-procedure symptoms were weight loss, abdominal pain, vomiting, obstruction, and bleeding. Time to oral intake was reported in 5 of 9 studies, ranging from a mean of 2.9 days (laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy) to 8 days (surgical bypass). Length of postoperative inpatient stay ranged from a mean of 7 days (gastrojejunostomy) to 28 days (surgical bypass). Other measures of effective palliation included measures of clinical success, hospital re-admission rates, and post-procedure analgesic intake. A paucity of literature exists regarding the QOL of surgically managed gastric cancer patients. Prospectively designed studies using credible QOL measures are necessary to better inform the treatment decision-making process for these patients.",10.1007/s10120-011-0070-0,,,,545
873,"Predictive Value of Gut Peptides in T2D Remission: Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Metabolic Gastric Bypass, Sleeve Gastrectomy and Greater Curvature Plication.","Our aim was to determine the predictive value of gut hormone changes for the improvement of type 2 diabetes (T2D) following metabolic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (mRYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), and greater curvature plication (GCP) in a randomized controlled trial. Contradictory results have been obtained regarding the role of gastrointestinal hormones (in particular GLP-1) in beneficial metabolic bariatric surgery outcomes. Forty-five patients with T2D (mean BMI 39.4Â Â±Â 1.9Â kg/m2) were randomly assigned to mRYGB, SG, or GCP. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters, fasting concentrations of PYY, ghrelin, glucagon, and area under the curve (AUC) of GLP-1 after a standard meal test were determined prior to and at months 1 and 12 after surgery. Twelve months after surgery, total weight loss percentage was higher and HbA1c lower in the mRYGB group than in the SG and GCP groups (-35.2Â Â±Â 8.1 and 5.1Â Â±Â 0.6% vs. -27.8Â Â±Â 5.4 and 6.2Â Â±Â 0.8% vs. -20.5Â Â±Â 6.8 and 6.6Â Â±Â 1.3%; pÂ =Â 0.007 and pÂ <Â 0.001, respectively). Moreover, GLP-1 AUC at months 1 and 12 was greater and T2D remission was higher in mRYGB (80 vs. 53.3 vs. 20%, pÂ <Â 0.001). Insulin treatment (odds ratio (OR) 0.025, pÂ =Â 0.018) and the increase in GLP-1 AUC from baseline to month 1 (OR 1.021, pÂ =Â 0.013) were associated with T2D remission. mRYGB achieves a superior rate of weight loss and T2D remission at month 12. Enhanced GLP-1 secretion 1Â month after surgery was a determinant of glucose metabolism improvement.

1071,Impact of Bariatric Surgery on Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis.,"To investigate the effect of weight loss after bariatric surgery among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We conducted a retrospective cohort study of RA patients who underwent bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, or sleeve gastrectomy) at 2 medical centers. We obtained information on anthropometrics, laboratory values, RA disease activity, and medication use at baseline (prior to surgery), at 6 and 12 months following surgery, and at the most recent followup visits. RA disease activity was determined by clinical or validated measures. At each postsurgical visit, characteristics were compared to baseline. We identified 53 RA patients who underwent bariatric surgery. At baseline prior to surgery, meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SD body mass index was 47.8â€‰Â±â€‰7.7 kg/m(2), meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SD weight was 128.2â€‰Â±â€‰24.1 kg, and 57% had moderate to high RA disease activity. Twelve months following surgery, subjects lost a meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SD weight of 41.0â€‰Â±â€‰17.3 kg, meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SD 70%â€‰Â±â€‰24% excess weight (P < 0.001). RA disease activity significantly improved at postsurgical visits (P < 0.001). At 12 months following surgery, 6% had moderate to high disease activity, compared to 57% at baseline (P < 0.001). At the most recent followup (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SD 5.8â€‰Â±â€‰3.2 years after surgery), 74% were in remission, compared to 26% at baseline (P < 0.001). Subjects had significantly lower erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and RA-related medication use at followup visits compared to baseline (P < 0.05). After substantial weight loss from bariatric surgery, RA patients had lower disease activity, decreased serum inflammatory markers, and less RA-related medication use. Weight loss may be an important nonpharmacologic strategy to reduce RA disease activity. However, other factors, such as improved efficacy of medications, improved physical activity, and metabolic changes, may also have contributed to these postsurgical improvements.",10.1002/acr.22629,,,,547
311,Comparative risk of anemia and related micronutrient deficiencies after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy in patients with obesity: An updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Although Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are the most prevalent bariatric surgical procedures, high-level evidence is scarce regarding the assessment of postoperative nutritional risk in RYGB versus SG. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the risk of anemia and related micronutrient deficiencies after RYGB and SG. We analyzed 10 randomized controlled trials that compared RYGB and SG with reported incidence of postoperative anemia and/or anemia-related micronutrient deficiencies (iron, vitamin B12 , or folate). There were no significant differences in the risk of postoperative anemia (moderate level of evidence), iron deficiency (high level of evidence), or folate deficiency (moderate level of evidence). Patients undergoing RYGB had a higher risk of postoperative vitamin B12 deficiency than those undergoing SG (relative risk, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-3.02; pâ€‰=â€‰0.012; high level of evidence). Our findings imply that patients undergoing RYGB require more stringent vitamin B12 supplementation and surveillance than those undergoing SG. Additionally, our results may aid patients with high concern for anemia and related micronutrient deficiencies in making informed decisions regarding surgical methods based on nutritional risk.",10.1111/obr.13419,,,,548
1231,Gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy for type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of outcomes.,"Bariatric surgery is effective in the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity; however, it is not clear whether Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GBP) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is the most effective procedure. This review compared T2D remission and weight loss in patients with T2D after GBP or SG. All human SG or GBP studies published in English between 1 Jan 2007 and 30 April 2012 reporting on BMI and T2D outcomes were included. Analyses were performed separately for the most frequent distinct time points reported after surgery. A total of 21 prospective (three randomised control trials) and 12 retrospective studies, involving 1375 patients met eligibility criteria. T2D remission defined by hemoglobin A1c of <6.5 % for GBP and SG respectively was 67 and 56 % at 3 months, 76 and 68 % at 12 months, and 81 and 80 % at 36 months. Greater percent excess BMI loss occurred at 12 months (72.5 % after GBP and 66.7 % after SG) compared with 3 months (45.9 % after GBP and 25.9 % after SG). There was no significant difference in either T2D remission or weight loss with GBP compared with SG. Both GBP and SG result in similar early remission of T2D in 67 and 56 % of patients at 3 months respectively with modest additional T2D remission with time, although weight loss with both procedures increase substantially between 3 and 12 months post-operatively. Further randomised controlled trials comparing SG and GBP in patients with T2D using comparable definitions of diabetes remission with long-term follow-up are needed to evaluate relative benefits.",10.1007/s11695-013-1030-z,,,,549
711,Gastric Emptying and Food Tolerance Following Banded and Non-banded Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.,"Gastric emptying (GE) and food tolerance (FT) can be altered after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has been performed, especially when it involved the use of a restrictive mechanism (such as a silastic ring). To assess GE and FT in patients who underwent banded (BRYGB) or non-banded Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Forty-seven BRYGB patients and 47 RYGB patients underwent gastric emptying scintigraphy (GES) and FT assessment (by means of a questionnaire) between 6Â months and 2Â years postoperatively. GES was performed on average 11.7â€‰Â±â€‰5.0Â months (6 to 24) postoperatively. TÂ½ medians (time taken for the gastric radioactivity to decrease to half of the original value in the gastric pouch) in the RYGB and BRYGB groups were 48.7Â min (40.6-183.0Â min) and 56.3Â min (41.1-390.9Â min), respectively (pâ€‰=â€‰0.031). The median of total questionnaire scores was 24 points (18-27) in the RYGB group and 20 points (13-27) in the BRYBG group (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The band (silastic ring) delays GE time and does not affect patient satisfaction or food tolerance to vegetables, bread, or rice, but does affect tolerance to the intake of meat, salad, and pasta. The best tolerated foods are vegetables, salad, and fish. Banded patients are more likely to regurgitate and vomit. Gastric emptying does not affect FT.",10.1007/s11695-018-3561-9,,,,550
559,Safety of adjustable gastric band conversion surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the leak rate in 1- and 2-stage procedures.,"Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding has been a popular bariatric surgery in the United States since the early 2000s. Over the years, various long-term complications have prompted removal of these devices. To avoid subsequent weight gain, explanation of the gastric band is often followed by concomitant or staged conversion to another bariatric procedure. It is our goal to evaluate the relative leak rate in 1- versus 2-stage adjustable gastric band conversion surgery. Private teaching hospital, United States. A search was performed in the PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases to evaluate literature regarding adjustable gastric band conversion procedures. After identification of publications that directly compared 1- and 2-stage laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding conversions, the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale was used to determine if they would be used in our meta-analysis. The risk ratio for leak in 1- versus 2-stage conversions was then calculated. Our search yielded 483 publications. Twenty-five publications qualified for inclusion. The overall calculated risk ratio for leak in 1- versus 2-stage conversions was .90 (confidence interval [CI] .51-1.61, P = .73). Eight publications were found that discussed conversion from laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The risk ratio for 1- versus 2-stage conversions for this subgroup was .82 (CI .35-1.93, P = .65). Eight publications were found that evaluated conversion to sleeve gastrectomy. The risk ratio of leak for 1- versus 2-stage conversions for these patients was 1.61 (CI .55-4.72, P = .39). Based on the results of this meta-analysis, there does not appear to be a significant difference in the overall leak rate between 1- and 2-stage adjustable gastric band conversions. The findings of our subgroup analysis suggest that there may be a safety advantage for 1-stage procedures when converting to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and 2-stage procedures when converting to sleeveÂ gastrectomy.",10.1016/j.soard.2019.12.001,,,,551
1362,Bariatric surgery as a novel treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review.,"To systematically review the literature pertaining to the reversal of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and adjustable gastric banding. We conducted a review of the literature using PubMed and searched the reference lists of published studies to identify additional studies. We selected all published articles that were relevant with respect to bariatric surgery and its metabolic effects. Only 9 original articles reporting on DM2 reversal rates after bariatric surgery were identified: 1 randomized controlled trial and 8 observational studies. Other referenced articles serve as background literature. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass leads to a reversal rate of DM2 of 83%. Adjustable gastric banding confers a reversal rate of 62%, and this effect is achieved later after surgery. Bariatric surgery leads to marked and long-lasting weight reduction. A large proportion of patients undergoing bariatric surgery have DM2. In fact, the presence of diabetes mellitus is a compelling argument to perform bariatric surgery in those who are eligible according to international criteria. Glycemic control improves in the months after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, but it improves more rapidly and completely after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. Thus, both types of surgery are capable of improving or even curing DM2, but the mechanisms may differ.",10.1001/archsurg.2011.134,,,,552
1475,Compression anastomosis clip for gastrointestinal anastomosis.,"To investigate the feasibility of compression anastomosis clip (CAC) for gastrointestinal anastomosis proximal to the ileocecal junction. Sixty-six patients undergoing gastrointestinal anastomosis proximal to the ileocecal junction were randomized into two groups according to the anastomotic method, CAC or stapler. The postoperative recovery of patients in CAC and stapled anastomosis groups was similar. No postoperative complication related to the anastomotic method was found in either group. Both upper gastrointestinal contrast radiography at the early postoperative course and endoscopic examination after a 6-mo follow-up showed a better healing at the compression anastomosis. CAC can be used not only in colonic surgery but also in gastrointestinal anastomosis. Our result strongly suggests that CAC anastomosis is safe in various complication circumstances. However, it should be further confirmed with a larger patient sample.",10.3748/wjg.14.4938,,,,553
462,Beware Pathological Findings of the Stomach in Patients Undergoing Bariatric Surgery: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Abnormal anatomic findings are a major concern before performing bariatric surgery, while pathological changes are considered less often. The present study aimed to investigate the incidences of gastric lesions warranting follow-up in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Meta-analyses were conducted to calculate the pooled incidences of gastric lesions in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Fifty-nine studies including 32,789 patients were included: 26 on endoscopic biopsy, 26 on pathological findings of the excised specimen, five on the intraoperative exploration results, and two on both preoperative endoscopy and postoperative specimen. Generally, atrophic gastritis (3.05% (95% CI (confidence interval) 1.53-6.09)), intestinal metaplasia (2.44% (95% CI 1.76-3.25)), and GIST (gastrointestinal stromal tumor) (0.45% (95% CI 0.31-0.60)) were not rarely found. Routine preoperative endoscopy was applied in 16 studies, and the pooled incidences of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia were 2.64% (95% CI 0.78-8.9) and 2.70% (95% CI 0.9-5.42), respectively. Hp. (Helicobacter pylori) screening and eradication were routinely performed in 10 studies, and that was related to a reduced incidence of atrophic gastritis (0.94% (95% CI 0.03-2.92)) vs. 4.31% (95% CI 2.01-9.23). GIST was more likely to be found by intraoperative exploration than by preoperative endoscopy (0.68% (95% CI 0.50-0.93) vs. 0.23% (95% CI 0.11-0.52)). Patients undergoing bariatric surgery demonstrated non-negligible incidences of gastric pathologies warranting follow-up. Preoperative endoscopy and careful intraoperative exploration should be routinely performed, and Hp. screening and eradication are suggested before endoscopy. In condition that such findings are detected, sleeve gastrectomy may be preferred over Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.",10.1007/s11695-020-05029-7,,,,554
1493,"The use of fibrin sealant to prevent major complications following laparoscopic gastric bypass: results of a multicenter, randomized trial.","Published interim results have shown that fibrin sealant (Tissucol/Tisseel Baxter AG, Vienna, Austria) may be effective in preventing anastomotic leaks and internal hernias following laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP). We report the final results of a multicenter, randomized clinical trial evaluating the use of fibrin sealant in LRYGBP. Between January 2004 and December 2005, 340 patients aged 21-65 years with a body mass index (BMI) of 40-59 kg/m(2) undergoing LRYGBP were randomized (1:1) to two treatment groups: fibrin sealant group (applied to gastrojejunal and jejunojejunal anastomoses and over mesenteric openings), and control group (no fibrin sealant; suture of the mesenteric openings). Operative time, early and late complications, reinterventions, time to oral diet initiation, and length of stay were assessed. Overall, 320 patients were included into the study: 160 in the control group and 160 in the fibrin sealant group. All patients completed follow-up assessments at 6 and 12 months, and 60.9% completed assessments at 24 months. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to demographics, operative time, oral diet initiation, hospital stay, and BMI reduction at 6, 12, and 24 months. The incidence of anastomotic leak was numerically, but not significantly, greater in the control group. The overall reintervention rate for specific early complications (<30 days) was significantly higher in the control group (p = 0.016). No deaths or conversions to open laparotomy occurred. The use of fibrin sealant in laparoscopic RYGBP may be beneficial in reducing the reintervention rate for major perioperative (<30 days) complications. Larger studies are needed.",10.1007/s00464-008-9885-0,,,,555
666,Deep neuromuscular blockade improves surgical conditions during gastric bypass surgery for morbid obesity: A randomised controlled trial.,"There is a controversy in the literature whether deep compared with moderate neuromuscular block (NMB) improves surgical conditions for laparoscopic surgery. The primary outcome measure was to examine whether switching from moderate to deep NMB improves surgical conditions for laparoscopic surgery in the obese; secondary outcome measures were changes in intra-abdominal pressure, time required to perform the gastrojejunal anastomosis and peri-operative surgical complications. A single-centre, randomised controlled study. Each patient was taken as their own control and examined twice: at the first evaluation (E1), all patients had a moderate NMB, thereafter patients were randomised to deep or moderate block and a second evaluation (E2) was performed within 10â€Šmin. Patients with excellent rating at E1 were excluded from E2, as their surgical condition could not be further improved. University Hospital France. Patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery under general anaesthesia were included. Main exclusion criteria were hypersensitivity to the drugs used and absence of written informed consent. According to the group assignment, patients received bolus doses of rocuronium or 0.9% saline. Surgical conditions were assessed with a 4-point rating scale. Intra-operative adverse events were assessed with the Kaafarani-classification and postoperative complications with the Clavien-Dindo classification. Eighty-nine patients were initially included and data from 85 could be assessed at E1; surgical rating was excellent in 20, good in 35, acceptable in 18, poor in 12. After excluding those with an excellent rating, the remaining 65 patients were randomly assigned to deep or moderate block. At E2, an improvement of surgical conditions was observed in 29 out of 34 patients with deep block and in four out of 31 with moderate block; Pâ€Š<â€Š0.0001. Poor surgical conditions were more frequently associated with surgical complications (61.5 versus 15.3%; Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001). Switching from moderate to deep block improves surgical conditions. Poor surgical conditions were associated with a higher incidence of surgical complications. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02118844.",10.1097/EJA.0000000000000996,,,,556
1556,Endoscopic evaluation of the gastrojejunostomy in laparoscopic gastric bypass. A series of 340 patients without postoperative leak.,"A significant and potentially deadly complication of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is leakage from the gastrojejunostomy (GJ). The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of intraoperative endoscopy in preventing postoperative anastomotic leakage. The study enrolled 340 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass procedures performed from January 2001 to July 2004. In all cases, an endoscopist performed video gastroscopy to evaluate the integrity of the GJ using air insufflation of the pouch after distal clamping of the Roux limb. Intraoperative leaks were repaired and the anastomosis was retested. Demographic, operative, and endoscopic data were collected and analyzed. Logistic regression was used in both univariate and multivariate modeling to identify independent preoperative variables associated with the presence of intraoperative leak. Model parameters were estimated by the maximum likelihood method. From these estimates, odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed. There were no postoperative anastomotic leaks or mortalities in our series. Overall, endoscopic evaluation of the GJ resulted in the detection of 56 intraoperative leaks (16.4%). There was a significant difference in the incidence of intraoperative leakage for patients older than 40 years (21%) vs those younger than 40 years (10.5%; p = 0.01). In the initial 91 cases, the GJ was performed by the end-to-end anastomosis (EEA) technique; the subsequent 249 were performed with a combination of linear stapling and handsewn technique. There was a trend toward more leakage in the GIA group (18%) versus EEA (12%); however, the difference was not significant (p = 0.188). Age remained an independent risk factor for leak detected intraoperatively in the multivariate logistic regression model after adjusting for covariates. Age >40 years increased the risk of intraoperative leakage by 2.3 times (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2-4.6; p = 0.01). The rate of postoperative anastomotic stricture was the same among patients detected with an intraoperative leak (5.4%) and those without (5.6%; p = 0.934). Endoscopic evaluation of the GJ is a sensitive and reliable technique for demonstrating anastomotic integrity and preventing postoperative morbidity after gastric bypass. Age >40 years was identified as an independent risk factor for intraoperative leak in this series.",10.1007/s00464-005-0118-5,,,,557
1292,Dietary changes in obese patients undergoing gastric bypass or lifestyle intervention: a clinical trial.,"We compared changes in the dietary patterns of morbidly obese patients undergoing either laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery or a comprehensive lifestyle intervention programme. The present 1-year non-randomised controlled trial included fifty-four patients in the lifestyle group and seventy-two in the surgery group. Dietary intake was assessed by a validated FFQ. ANCOVA was used to adjust for between-group differences in sex, age, baseline BMI and baseline values of the dependent variables. Intakes of food groups and nutrients did not differ significantly between the intervention groups at baseline. At 1-year follow-up, the lifestyle group had a significantly higher daily intake of fruits and vegetables (561 (sd 198) v. 441 (sd 213) g, P= 0Â·002), whole grains (63 (sd 24) v. 49 (sd 16) g, P< 0Â·001) and fibre (28 (sd 6) v. 22 (sd 6) g, P< 0Â·001) than the surgery group and a lower percentage of total energy intake of saturated fat (12 (sd 3) v. 14 (sd 3) %, P< 0Â·001). The intake of red meat declined significantly within both groups, vegetables and fish intake were reduced significantly in the surgery group and added sugar was reduced significantly in the lifestyle group. The lifestyle patients improved their dietary patterns significantly (compared with the surgery group), increasing their intake of vegetables, whole grains and fibre and reducing their percentage intake of saturated fat (ANCOVA, all P< 0Â·001). In conclusion, lifestyle intervention was associated with more favourable dietary 1-year changes than gastric bypass surgery in morbidly obese patients, as measured by intake of vegetables, whole grains, fibre and saturated fat.",10.1017/S0007114512004631,,,,558
409,Is duodeno-jejunal bypass liner superior to pylorus preserving bariatric surgery in terms of complications and efficacy?,"Based on recent scientific evidence, bariatric surgery is more effective in the management of morbid obesity and related comorbidities than conservative therapy. Pylorus preserving surgical procedures (PPBS) such as laparoscopic single-anastomosis duodeno-jejunal or duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy are modified duodenal switch (DS) surgical techniques. The duodeno-jejunal bypass liner (DJBL) is a novel surgical method in the inventory of metabolism focused manual interventions that excludes duodeno-jejunal mucosa from digestion, mimicking DS procedures without the risk of surgical intervention. The aim of this article is to summarize and compare differences between safety-related features and weight loss outcomes of DJBL and PPBS. A literature search was conducted in the PubMed database. Records of DJBL-related adverse events (AEs), occurrence of PPBS-related complications and reintervention rates were collected. Mean weight, mean body mass index (BMI), percent of excess of weight loss (EWL%), percent of total weight loss (TWL%) and BMI value alterations were recorded for weight loss outcomes. A total of 11 publications on DJBL and 6 publications on PPBS were included, involving 800 and 1462 patients, respectively. The baseline characteristics of the patients were matched. Comparison of DJBL-related AEs and PPBS-related severe complications showed an almost equal risk (risk difference (RD): -0.03 and confidence interval (CI): -0.27 to 0.21), despite higher rates among patients having received endoscopic treatment. Overall AE and complication rates classified by Clavien-Dindo showed that PPBS was superior to DJBL due to an excess risk level of 25% (RD: 0.25, CI: 0.01-0.49). Reintervention rates were more favourable in the PPBS group, without significant differences in risk (RD: -0.03, CI: -0.27 to 0.20). However, PPBS seemed more efficient regarding weight loss outcomes at 1-year follow-up according to raw data, while meta-analysis did not reveal any significant difference (odds ratio (OR): 1.08, CI: 0.74-1.59 for BMI changes). Only limited conclusions can be made based on our findings. PPBS was superior to DJBL with regard to safety outcomes (GRADE IIB), which failed to support the authors' hypothesis. Surgical procedures showed lower complication rates than the incidence of DJBL-related AEs, although it should be emphasized that the low number of PPBS-related mild to moderate complications reported could be the result of incomplete data recording from the analysed publications. Weight loss outcomes favoured bariatric surgery (GRADE IIB). As the DJBL is implanted into the upper gastrointestinal tract for 6 to 12 months, it seems a promising additional method in the inventory of metabolic interventions.",10.1007/s00423-021-02131-x,,,,559
904,Weight Loss Outcomes in Laparoscopic Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (LVSG) Versus Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB) Procedures: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy (LVSG) have been proposed as cost-effective strategies to manage morbid obesity. The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the postoperative weight loss outcomes reported in randomized control trials (RCTs) for LVSG versus LRYGB procedures. RCTs comparing the weight loss outcomes following LVSG and LRYGB in adult population between January 2000 and November 2015 were selected from PubMed, Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, Current Contents, and the Cochrane database. The review was prepared in accordance with Preferred Reporting of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Nine unique RCTs described over 10 publications involving a total of 865 patients (LVSG, n=437; LRYGB, n=428) were analyzed. Postoperative follow-up ranged from 3 months to 5 years. Twelve-month excess weight loss (EWL) for LVSG ranged from 69.7% to 83%, and for LRYGB, ranged from 60.5% to 86.4%. A number of studies reported slow weight gain between the second and third years of postoperative follow-up ranging from 1.4% to 4.2%EWL. This trend was seen to continue to 5 years postoperatively (8% to 10%EWL) for both procedures. In conclusion, LRYGB and LVSG are comparable with regards to the weight loss outcomes in the short term, with LRYGB achieving slightly greater weight loss. Slow weight recidivism is observed after the first postoperative year following both procedures. Long-term reporting of outcomes obtained from well-designed studies using intention-to-treat analyses are identified as a major gap in the literature at present.",10.1097/SLE.0000000000000374,,,,560
1304,Clinical observation of gastric bypass in treatment of type 2 diabetes.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GBP) is the main surgical procedure used in type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the different types of GBP in treatment of type 2 diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly divided into two groups: those who underwent gastrojejunal loop anastomosis bypass and those who underwent gastrojejunal Roux-en-Y bypass. Blood glucose alterations, operation time, and operation complications were observed. Gastrojejunal loop anastomosis bypass and gastrojejunal Roux-en-Y bypass were both effective in the treatment of selected patients with type 2 diabetes. Compared with gastrojejunal Roux-en-Y bypass, gastrojejunal loop anastomosis bypass had the advantages of easier implementation, shorter operation time, and fewer operation complications. Gastrojejunal loop anastomosis is effective in treatment of type 2 diabetes. It is safe, easy to implement, and worthy of clinical popularization.",,,,,561
1427,Intraoperative fluid replacement and postoperative creatine phosphokinase levels in laparoscopic bariatric patients.,"Morbid obesity and bariatric surgery are both risk factors for the development of postoperative rhabdomyolysis (RML). RML results from injury to skeletal muscle, and a serum creatine phosphokinase (CK) level >1,000 IU/L is considered diagnostic of RML. The aim of this study was to determine if intraoperative intravenous fluid (IVF) volume affects postoperative CK levels following laparoscopic bariatric operations. Prospective, single blinded, and randomized trial was conducted. Patients scheduled to undergo laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, adjustable gastric band, or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass operations were randomized into two groups. Subjects in Group A received 15 ml/kg total body weight (TBW) of IV crystalloid solution during surgery, while subjects in Group B received 40 ml/kg TBW. Preoperative and postoperative CK and creatinine levels and intra- and postoperative urine output were monitored and recorded. Forty-seven patients were assigned to Group A and 53 patients to Group B. Group B patients had significantly higher urine output in the operating room, in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), and on postoperative days 0 and 1. Group B patients also had significantly lower serum creatinine level in the PACU and a trend towards lower creatinine levels on postoperative days 0, 1, and 2. There were no statistical differences in CK levels at any time between the two groups. Four patients in Group A and three patients in Group B developed postoperative RML. Conservative (15 ml/kg) versus liberal (40 ml/kg) intraoperative IVF administration did not change the incidence of RML in patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric operations. Since the occurrence of RML in this patient population is relatively high, postoperative CK levels should be routinely obtained in patients at special risk.",10.1007/s11695-010-0092-4,,,,562
33,Primary Robotic Versus Conventional Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in Morbidly Obese Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Robotic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RRYGB) and conventional laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) are commonly performed as primary bariatric procedures. The aim of this article was to assess the role of RRYGB in patients undergoing primary bariatric procedures. All of the qualified studies were selected from the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases, etc. We mainly compared the outcomes and safety between RRYGB and LRYGB. The outcomes evaluation included surgical effect and surgical safety. In total, 35 studies containing 426,463 patients were selected. The mortalities of patients adopting these 2 bariatric procedures were similar (RRYGB: 59/28,023, 0.21%; LRYGB: 612/397,945, 0.15%). We found no significant difference between RRYGB and LRYGB in the incidence of postoperative complications (30-day: OR=1.06, P =0.18; 1-y: OR=1.06, P =0.92). The incidence of 30-day readmission after the operation was higher in RRYGB patients (OR=1.24, P =0.003). However, we found that the RRYGB group had a lower incidence of anastomotic stricture 1 year after the operation when compared with LRYGB (OR=0.35, P =0.0004). The 1-year %EBMIL of these 2 groups was similar (78.53% vs. 76.02%). There was no significant difference in length of hospital stay (LOS) (WMD=-0.03d, P =0.59), conversion rate (OR=0.84, P =0.75), or anastomotic leak (OR=1.00, P =0.99) between these 2 groups. The mean hospital charges were higher in the RRYGB group ($11234.75 vs. $9468.58). This systematic review and meta-analysis showed no significant advantage of RRYGB in surgical effect or reduction of intraoperative complications. RRYGB may reduce the incidence of some postoperative long-term complications. The mean hospital charges of RRYGB were higher.",10.1097/SLE.0000000000001293,,,,563
1274,Does Roux-en-Y gastrectomy for gastric cancer influence glucose homeostasis in lean patients?,"Cancer gastrectomy seems to benefit type 2 diabetes; however, results are conflicting. In a prospective protocol, including retrospective information, the aim was assessment of changes in glucose profile in patients with both normal and deranged preoperative glucose homeostasis. Patients (N = 164) with curative subtotal or total Roux-en-Y gastrectomy for gastric cancer (n = 92), or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity (RYGB, n = 72) were preoperatively classified into diabetes (including prediabetes) and control group. Postoperative diabetes outcome was stratified as responsive or refractory, and results in controls were correspondingly defined as stable or new-onset diabetes (NOD), according to fasting blood glucose and HbA1c. Dietary intake and biochemical profile was documented. Statistical methods included analysis of variance, multivariate logistic regression, and propensity score matching according to postoperative weight loss. Age of cancer cases was 67.9 Â± 11.5 years, 56.5 % males, initial body mass index (BMI) 24.7 Â± 3.7, current BMI 22.6 Â± 3.8 kg/m(2), and follow-up 102.1 Â± 51.0 months, whereas in bariatric individuals age was 51.4 Â± 10.1 years, 15.3 % males, initial BMI 56.7 Â± 12.2, current BMI 34.8 Â± 8.1 kg/m(2), and follow-up 104.1 Â± 29.7 months. Refractory disease corresponded to 62.5 % (cancer) versus 23.5 % (bariatric) (P = 0.019), whereas NOD represented 69.2 versus 23.8 % respectively (P = 0.016). Weight loss (Î”BMI) was associated with diabetes response in cancer patients but not with NOD. No difference between subtotal and total gastrectomy was detected. Divergent outcomes (refractory vs. responsive) were confirmed in BMI-similar, propensity-matched cancer gastrectomy patients with preoperative diabetes, consistent with weight-dependent and -independent benefits. Diabetes response was confirmed, however with more refractory cases than in bariatric controls, whereas high proportions of NOD occurred. Such dichotomous pattern seems unusual albeit consistent with previous studies.",10.1007/s00464-013-2829-3,,,,564
304,The APB study: apixaban pharmacokinetics in bariatric patients before to 1 year after vertical sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"The optimal regimen for prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism in bariatric surgical patients remains controversial. Direct oral anticoagulants are potentially advantageous over other agents, but inadequate evidence exists regarding their effects in bariatric surgical patients. To investigate single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of apixaban when administered to patients undergoing vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and to determine whether the PK and PD parameters are affected by type of bariatric surgery and weight loss in the immediate and postoperative period up to 12 months. University Hospital and A Bariatric Center of Excellence, Baltimore, Maryland. Adults with a body mass index â‰¥35 kg/m2 approved for bariatric surgery were enrolled in a single-center, open-label, nonrandomized, single-dose clinical study (NCT No. 02406885; www. gov). Apixaban PK and PD parameters were measured after a single 5 mg dose of the drug was given preoperatively and at 1, 6, and 12 months postoperatively in patients undergoing VSG and RYGB. Change in PK parameters was assessed as maximum concentration, time to maximum concentration, elimination half-life, and area under the concentration-time curve from 0-72 hours and change in PD parameters were assessed by chromogenic factor X activity. Of 33 patients enrolled, 28 (14 VSG, 14 RYGB) completed all visits and were analyzed. Most patients (89%) were female, with a mean age of 43.8 years and a body mass index of 48.7 kg/m2. Area under the concentration-time curve from 0-72 hours increased from baseline to 1 month (1009.1 to 1232.9 ng/mL/hr, P = .002), returned to baseline at 6 months (1000.9 ng/mL/hr, P = .88), and decreased significantly at 12 months (841.8 ng/mL/hr, P = .001). Maximum concentration did not change significantly. Predose factor X activity dropped significantly from 113% preoperatively to 89.8 % at 12 months postoperatively (P < .0001). Three-hour postdose factor X activity was significantly lower at 1, 6, and 12 months postoperatively versus preoperatively. However, the magnitude of the decrease from predose to 3-hour postdose was not significantly altered by surgery. The effect of either VSG or RYGB on apixaban PK and PD parameters is minimal. Factor X activity after 5 mg apixaban was lower in postoperative versus preoperative bariatric patients, but this effect appears to be primarily the result of a decrease in factor X activity from bariatric surgery itself and not a postoperative change in apixaban PK and PD parameters. Future studies should investigate the safety, efficacy, and clinical outcomes of apixaban and other direct oral anticoagulants perioperatively and beyond 12 months following bariatric surgery.",10.1016/j.soard.2021.12.023,,,,565
1577,The use of bovine pericardial strips on linear stapler to reduce extraluminal bleeding during laparoscopic gastric bypass: prospective randomized clinical trial.,"A prospective comparison was conducted of extraluminal bleeding following gastric transection with or without staple-line reinforcement by dehydrated bovine pericardium (Peri-Strips Dry--PSD) during laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP). From January 2001 to September 2003, 98 consecutive morbidly obese patients underwent LRYGBP. Patients were randomly allocated to 2 groups according to the use (Group A, n= 50) or not (Group B, n= 48) of Peri-Strips Dry. In both groups, mortality, intra- and postoperative early and late complications, operating-time, number of hemostatic clips used, blood transfusion and any specific event directly related to the prosthetic material were prospectively evaluated. Data were expressed as mean +/- SD except as otherwise indicated. Statistical analysis was done by means of Student t-test and Fisher exact test. P-value cut off for statistical significance was set at 0.05. Intra- and postoperative mortality were absent. Intra-operative methylene blue test was positive in 6/48 (12.5%) of Group B patients (P<0.001). Overall laparotomic conversion was 3/98 patients (3.1%). One/48 Group B patient was converted because of unsatisfactory exposure and one for linear stapler misfire. One/50 Group A patients was converted for short gastric vessels bleeding during dissection. No patients were re-operated or transfused because of extraluminal bleeding. Mean number of clips used was significantly lower in Group A patients (5 vs 23, P<0.001). The operating-time was significantly less in Group A patients (120+/-60 vs 220+/-100 minutes, P<0.01). Gastric staple-lines reinforced with Peri-Strips Dry result in a significant reduction in the number of Endo-clips used and prevent bleeding. A dry operating field was obtained, and operating-time was significantly reduced. No adverse events could be related to the use PSD.",10.1381/0960892042387075,,,,566
1064,Preoperative Methods to Reduce Liver Volume in Bariatric Surgery: a Systematic Review.,"Patients qualified for gastric bypass surgery have an enlarged and fatty liver. An essential step in gastric bypass surgery is elevation of the left liver lobe to expose the gastroesophageal junction. An enlarged and fatty liver complicates the surgical procedure and increases the risk for laceration of the liver. The aim of our study was to evaluate methods to reduce liver volume in patients prior to gastric bypass surgery. A systematic literature search of multiple databases, including PubMed, EMBASE.com, and the Cochrane Library and a hand search of reference lists, was performed. We used the search terms morbid obesity and liver, including their synonyms and controlled terms. Inclusion criteria were as follows: patients with morbid obesity who qualified for bariatric surgery, the use of a preoperative treatment to reduce liver volume, and the use of imaging techniques before and after treatment. In total, 281 patients in 11 different studies were included. Preoperative diets reduced liver size by an average of 14%, alternative methods including nutritional supplements, reduced liver size between 20 and 43%, and an intragastric balloon by 32%. This review showed that nutritional supplements and intragastric balloon are more effective than low calorie diets in reducing liver volume prior to gastric bypass surgery. However, low calorie diet is the preferable method to reduce liver volume, considering the level of evidence and practical applicability. There is a need for well-designed randomized studies with sufficient power in order to confirm the effectiveness of preoperative methods to reduce liver volume.",10.1007/s11695-015-1769-5,,,,567
254,Association of Amount of Weight Lost After Bariatric Surgery With Intracranial Pressure in Women With Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension.,"The idiopathic intracranial hypertension randomized controlled weight trial (IIH:WT) established that weight loss through bariatric surgery significantly reduced intracranial pressure when compared with a community weight management intervention. This substudy aimed to evaluate the amount of weight loss required to reduce intracranial pressure and to explore the effect of different bariatric surgical approaches. IIH:WT was a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Adult women with active idiopathic intracranial hypertension and a body mass index â‰¥35 kg/m2 were randomized to bariatric surgery or a community weight management intervention (1:1). This per-protocol analysis evaluated the relationship between intracranial pressure, weight loss, and the weight loss methods. A linear hierarchical regression model was used to fit the trial outcomes, adjusted for time, treatment arm, and weight. Sixty-six women were included, of whom 23 had received bariatric surgery by 12 months; the mean age was 31 (SD 8.7) years in the bariatric surgery group and 33.2 (SD 7.4) years in the dietary group. Baseline weight and intracranial pressure were similar in both groups with a mean weight of 119.5 (SD 24.1) and 117.9 (SD 19.5) kg and mean lumbar puncture opening pressure of 34.4 (SD 6.3) and 34.9 (SD 5.3) cmCSF in the bariatric surgery and dietary groups, respectively. Weight loss was significantly associated with reduction in intracranial pressure (R2 = 0.4734, p â‰¤ 0.0001). Twenty-four percentage of weight loss (weight loss of 13.3 kg [SD 1.76]) was associated with disease remission (intracranial pressure [ICP] â‰¤ 25 cmCSF). Roux-en-Y gastric bypass achieved greater, more rapid, and sustained ICP reduction compared with other methods. The greater the weight loss, the greater the reduction in ICP was documented. Twenty four percentage of weight loss was associated with disease remission. Such magnitude of weight loss was unlikely to be achieved without bariatric surgery, and hence, consideration of referral to a bariatric surgery program early for those with active idiopathic intracranial hypertension may be appropriate. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02124486; ISRCTN registry number ISRCTN40152829; doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN40152829. This study provides Class II evidence that weight loss after bariatric surgery results in reduction in intracranial pressure in adult women with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. This study is Class II because of the use of a per-protocol analysis.",10.1212/WNL.0000000000200839,,,,568
1504,Incidence of lower limbs deep vein thrombosis after open and laparoscopic gastric bypass: a prospective study.,"Lower limbs deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are major causes of morbidity and mortality and are even higher in bariatric patients. The longer operative time and higher immobility in these patients increase the DVT risk. Although deaths after bariatric surgery have been reported, there is no consensus regarding the prophylaxis of DVT. This study's objective is to determine the incidence of lower limbs DVT in patients submitted to Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass (RYGBP) under prophylaxis by enoxaparin. Patients with body mass index (BMI) equal to or higher than 35 kg/m(2) who submitted to RYGBP by laparotomy or laparoscopy using 40 mg/day of enoxaparin for 15 days were recruited between October 2004 and August 2005. Individuals with previous DVT and heparin allergy were excluded. Patients were tested for DVT using color Doppler ultrasound performed before surgery and on the second and fifth weeks after surgery. The study population included 136 patients, with 126 concluding the protocol. There were 79% (100/126) of female patients aged 19 to 65 years old, with mean of 40 years SD = 10 and BMI between 35 and 61 kg/m(2), mean of 43 kg/m(2) (SD = 5). All patients who submitted to RYGBP were divided as 55% (69/126) by laparoscopy and 45% (57/126) by laparotomy. The incidence rate of lower limbs DVT was 0.79% (1/126). The low incidence rate of DVT found in our study suggests that obesity might not be a major risk factor for venous thromboembolism in patients submitted to RYGBP.",10.1007/s11695-007-9268-y,,,,569
1384,Effects of postbariatric surgery weight loss on adipokines and metabolic parameters: comparison of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy--a prospective randomized trial.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) lead to rapid improvement in insulin sensitivity even before weight loss occurs. Adipokines are closely linked to obesity and insulin resistance. To date, it is unclear whether the different anatomic changes of the various bariatric procedures have different effects on hormones of adipocyte origin. In the present prospective, randomized study, we compared the 1-year follow-up results of LRYGB and LSG concerning weight loss, metabolic control, and fasting adipokine levels. Of 23 nondiabetic morbidly obese patients, 12 were randomized to LRYGB and 11 to LSG. The patients were investigated before and 1 week, 3 months, and 12 months after surgery. The fasting levels of glucose, insulin, lipids, and adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, and fibroblast growth factor-21) were analyzed. The body weight decreased markedly (P <.001) after either procedure (percentage of weight loss 16.4% Â± 1.3%, 24.8% Â± 1.7%, and 34.5% Â± 2.7% after LRYGB and 13.1% Â± 1.1%, 20.7% Â± 1.5%, and 27.9% Â± 2.6% after LSG at 2, 6, and 12 mo, respectively). The Homeostasis Model Assessment Index declined from 8.0 Â± 1.5 preoperatively to 2.9 Â± .2 at 12 months after LRYGB and from 7.5 Â± 1.7 preoperatively to 3.3 Â± .3 at 12 months after LSG. The lipid profiles were normalized. The concentrations of circulating leptin levels decreased by almost 50% as early as 1 week postoperatively and continued to decrease until 12 months postoperatively. Adiponectin increased progressively. The fibroblast growth factor-21 levels did not change over time. No difference was found between the LRYGB and LSG groups. Both procedures led to significant weight loss associated with the resolution of the metabolic syndrome. The serum leptin levels decreased and adiponectin increased with weight loss, paralleled by improved insulin sensitivity.",10.1016/j.soard.2011.01.044,,,,570
1377,"The effects of an amino acid supplement on glucose homeostasis, inflammatory markers, and incretins after laparoscopic gastric bypass.","Protein supplements are routinely used after a laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGB). The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of an amino acid supplement on glucose homeostasis and hormonal and inflammatory markers after LGB. Thirty patients undergoing LGB were randomized to receive or not 24 g of an oral supplement containing a leucine metabolite, glutamine, and arginine twice daily. Changes in weight, glucose, insulin, C-peptide, insulin sensitivity, interleukin (IL) 6, C-reactive protein (CRP), leptin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1, ghrelin, and incretins were assessed preoperatively and 2 weeks and 8 weeks postoperatively. Thirty patients (96.7% female, age 46.9 Â± 8.4 years, body mass index 43.3 Â± 4.1 kg/m(2)) were randomized. The experimental (n = 14) and control (n = 16) groups were not significantly different at baseline. Weight loss was similar for the 2 groups. Fasting glucose decreased significantly at 2 and 8 weeks compared with base line (p < 0.0001) with no difference between the experimental and control groups (p = 0.8), but insulin and calculated insulin sensitivity, which were similar at baseline, became significantly worse in the experimental group 8 weeks after surgery (p = 0.02 for insulin; p = 0.04 for the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance). CRP and IL-6, which were similar at baseline, were found to be significantly higher at 8 weeks in the experimental group (p = 0.018 and p = 0.05, respectively). Leptin and IGF-1 levels decreased significantly from baseline at 2 and 8 weeks (p < 0.0001), but there was no difference between the 2 groups. No significant changes in GLP-1, ghrelin, or gastric inhibitory polypeptide were noticed after 8 weeks. An amino acid supplement had no effect on the early postoperative incretins after LGB. It may have a negative influence on glucose kinetics and degree of inflammation. Future studies are needed to clarify these effects.",10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2010.12.040,,,,571
345,Evaluation of Intensive Telephonic Nutritional and Lifestyle Counseling to Enhance Outcomes of Bariatric Surgery.,"To determine the impact of an intensive perioperative nutritional and lifestyle support protocol on long-term outcomes of bariatric surgery. A retrospective observational study was conducted of 955 patients who underwent gastric bypass surgery between 2005 and 2015. Patients were divided into two cohorts: (1) 2005 through August 2013: these 767 patients were required to participate in the intensive telephone-based nutritional support program from 8Â weeks preoperative through 44Â weeks postoperative; (2) after August 2013, the program was discontinued and 188 patients did not have intensive telephonic nutritional support. Inverse probability weighting was used to obtain weight loss estimates at 1 and 3Â years postoperative. Time-to-event analyses were used to investigate hospitalization rates postoperative. Poisson models were used to investigate healthcare utilization. Patients who participated in the program exhibited 1.97% (95% CI 0.7, 3.3) greater %TWL at 1Â year and 2.2% (95% CI -0.3, 4.1) greater %TWL at 3Â years postoperative than patients who did not participate. Secondary analyses indicated participation in the program was associated with 44% shorter time to first hospitalization postoperative (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). In this health system, intensive nutritional support was associated with greater weight loss at 1 and 3Â years postoperative and higher hospitalization rates.",10.1007/s11695-021-05749-4,,,,572
1332,A controlled clinical trial of the effect of gastric bypass surgery and intensive lifestyle intervention on nocturnal hypertension and the circadian blood pressure rhythm in patients with morbid obesity.,"Nocturnal hypertension, increased night-to-day systolic blood pressure (BP) ratio and nondipper status (night-to-day systolic BP ratio > 0.9) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Our aim was to compare the 1-year effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) versus a program of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) only on nocturnal hypertension and circadian BP rhythm. The study participants were part of a 1-year, controlled clinical trial comparing the effect of RYGB or ILI on obesity-related comorbidities. Ninety participants (49 in the RYGB group) successfully completed 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring at baseline and follow-up and were eligible subsequently for analysis. A total of 71 subjects (79%) had nocturnal hypertension at baseline. The number of subjects with nocturnal hypertension decreased from 42 to 14 in the RYGB group (P â‰¤ .001) and from 29 to 27 (P = .791) in the ILI group. Subjects in the RYGB group had a lesser adjusted odds ratio (OR) of nocturnal hypertension at follow-up (OR 0.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.42; P â‰¤ .001); however, after further adjustment for weight loss, there was no additional beneficial effect of RYGB (P = .674). No differences between groups regarding improvement in the night-to-day systolic BP ratio were found after adjustment for 24-hour systolic pressure (P = .107). Both interventions showed a decrease in the proportion of subjects classified as nondippers, namely, 44% (P â‰¤ .001) and 28% (P = .002) in the RYGB and ILI groups, respectively. Only RYGB was associated with a decrease in the prevalence of nocturnal hypertension. Both interventions showed an improvement in dipper status, although RYGB was more effective.",10.1016/j.surg.2011.12.007,,,,573
1349,"Weight loss, cardiovascular risk factors, and quality of life after gastric bypass and duodenal switch: a randomized trial.","Gastric bypass and duodenal switch are currently performed bariatric surgical procedures. Uncontrolled studies suggest that duodenal switch induces greater weight loss than gastric bypass. To determine whether duodenal switch leads to greater weight loss and more favorable improvements in cardiovascular risk factors and quality of life than gastric bypass. Randomized, parallel-group trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00327912) 2 academic medical centers (1 in Norway and 1 in Sweden). 60 participants with a body mass index (BMI) between 50 and 60 kg/m(2). Gastric bypass (n = 31) or duodenal switch (n = 29). The primary outcome was the change in BMI after 2 years. Secondary outcomes included anthropometric measures; concentrations of blood lipids, glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein, and vitamins; and health-related quality of life and adverse events. Fifty-eight of 60 participants (97%) completed the study. The mean reductions in BMI were 17.3 kg/m(2) (95% CI, 15.7 to 19.0 kg/m(2)) after gastric bypass and 24.8 kg/m(2) (CI, 23.0 to 26.5 kg/m(2)) after duodenal switch (mean between-group difference, 7.44 kg/m(2) [CI, 5.24 to 9.64 kg/m(2)]; P < 0.001). Total cholesterol concentration decreased by 0.24 mmol/L (CI, -0.03 to 0.50 mmol/L) (9.27 mg/dL [CI, -1.16 to 19.3 mg/dL]) after gastric bypass and 1.07 mmol/L (CI, 0.79 to 1.35 mmol/L) (41.3 mg/dL [CI, 30.5 to 52.1 mg/dL]) after duodenal switch (mean between-group difference, 0.83 mmol/L [CI, 0.48 to 1.18 mmol/L]; 32.0 mg/dL [CI, 18.5 to 45.6 mg/dL]; P â‰¤ 0.001). Reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, anthropometric measures, fat mass, and fat-free mass were also greater after duodenal switch (P â‰¤ 0.010 for each between-group comparison). Both groups had reductions in blood pressure and mean concentrations of glucose, insulin, and C-reactive protein, with no between-group differences. The duodenal switch group, but not the gastric bypass group, had reductions in concentrations of vitamin A and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Most Short Form-36 Health Survey dimensional scores improved in both groups, with greater improvement in 1 of 8 domains (bodily pain) after gastric bypass. From surgery until 2 years, 10 participants (32%) had adverse events after gastric bypass and 18 (62%) after duodenal switch (P = 0.021). Adverse events related to malnutrition occurred only after duodenal switch. Clinical experience was greater with gastric bypass than with duodenal switch at the study centers. Duodenal switch surgery was associated with greater weight loss, greater reductions of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, and more adverse events. Improvements in other cardiovascular risk factors and quality of life were similar after both procedures.

165,Gastric cancer after Bariatric Bypass Surgery. Do they relate? (A Systematic Review).,"Bariatric bypass surgery has been an effective treatment for morbid obesity. However, there is an increasing number of reported cases of gastric cancer after bypass surgery. Our systematic review showed an increasing trend of gastric cancer cases after bariatric bypass surgery in the last decade, mostly located in the excluded stomach (77%) and diagnosed in an advanced stage. In addition to known risk factors such as tobacco smoking (17%), H. pylori infection (6%), and family history of gastric cancer (3%), bile reflux, a recently proposed cancer-promoting factor, was also estimated in 18% of the cases. Our data suggest that gastric cancer risk assessment should be considered before gastric bypass surgery, and further investigations are needed to determine the value of post-operative gastric cancer surveillance.",10.1007/s11695-023-06567-6,,,,575
586,Systematic review and meta-analysis of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass against laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for amelioration of NAFLD using four criteria.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) prevalence is rising worldwide, as a direct consequence of the obesity epidemic. Bariatric surgery provides proven NAFLD amelioration, although questions remain regarding whether Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is more effective. To answer this question, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis exclusively comparing RYGB and LSG for amelioration of NAFLD using 4 separate criteria: alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, NAFLD activity score, and NAFLD fibrosis score. Our search included 1290 initial studies, which were narrowed to 20 final studies in the meta-analysis. Overall, both RYGB and LSG significantly improved alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, NAFLD activity score, and NAFLD fibrosis score postoperatively. Direct comparisons of RYGB to LSG in any of the 4 criteria failed to demonstrate superiority. Our findings corroborate the current literature showing that bariatric surgery significantly improves biochemical and histologic parameters in patients with NAFLD. The novel individual comparisons of 4 criteria failed to show superiority between RYGB and LSG in ameliorating NAFLD. Despite several limitations, our study can assist clinicians by supporting the notion that RYGB and LSG may be equally efficacious in ameliorating NAFLD.",10.1016/j.soard.2019.09.060,,,,576
1214,Impact of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus sleeve gastrectomy on vitamin D metabolism: short-term results from a prospective randomized clinical trial.,"To assess postoperative outcomes of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Short-term results on vitamin D and parathormone (PTH) metabolism are reported. One hundred patients were randomly assigned to RYGB (n = 45) or SG (n = 55). Vitamin D, PTH, and calcium were assessed at inclusion and after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months (M1, M3, M6, and M12). Eighty-eight patients completed 1-year follow-up. Mean postoperative excess weight loss (%EWL) at M1, M3, M6, and M12 was 25.39, 43.47, 63.75, and 80.38 % versus 25.25, 51.32, 64.67, and 82.97 % in RYGB and SG, respectively. Vitamin D values were statistically significantly higher after SG compared to RYGB at M3 (61.57 pmol/L, standard deviation [SD] 14.29 vs. 54.81 SD 7.65; p = 0.01) and M12 (59.83 pmol/L, SD 6.41 vs. 56.15 SD 8.18; p = 0.02). Vitamin D deficiency rate decreased from 84.62 to 35 % at M6 (p = 0.04) and 48 % at M12 (p = 0.01) in the SG group, while there was no significant improvement in the RYGB group. Serum parathyroid hormone (sPTH) level was decreased significantly in the SG group by M3 (44.8 ng/L vs. 28.6; p = 0.03), M6 (44.9 ng/L vs. 25.8; p = 0.017), and M12 (41.4 ng/L vs. 20.5; p = 0.017). Secondary hyperparathyroidism rate was 20.83 and 24 % at M1 (p = 1), 16.67 and 8 % at M3 (p = 0.41), 14.29 and 0 % at M6 (p = 0.08), and 15 and 0 % at M12 (p = 0.23) in the RYGB and SG groups, respectively. Patients after RYGB had a significantly higher postoperative vitamin D deficiency and higher sPTH levels than after SG.",10.1007/s00464-013-3276-x,,,,577
989,Cost-Effectiveness of Bariatric Surgery for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Randomized Controlled Trial in China.,"To compare the remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) through treatment with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), and to analyze the cost-effectiveness of medical treatment, LSG, and LRYGB in T2DM patients (BMIâ€Šâ‰¥â€Š28).A 2-group randomized controlled trial was conducted at Diabetes Surgery Centre, Beijing Shijitan Hospital in Beijing, China. Subjects were 80 patients ages 16 to 65 years with a body mass index of 28â€Škg/m or more and duration of T2DM no more than 15 years. Subjects were randomly assigned (1:1) to undergo either LSG (nâ€Š=â€Š40) or LRYGB (nâ€Š=â€Š40) between February 3, 2011 and October 31, 2013. Of those patients, 72 (90%) were available at follow-up at 2 years. These patients included 34 (85%) who underwent LSG and 38 (95%) who underwent LRYGB. This study presents the follow-up data at 2 years, which compared LSG and LRYGB in T2DM patients. Partial remission and complete remission were determined, and weight loss, BMI, changes in abdominal circumference, cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured. The cost-effectiveness of each type of bariatric surgery was analyzed with a Markov simulation model that yielded quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs.From our analysis results, LSG and LRYGB are both have taken a great effect on the reduction of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and bodyweight in patients with T2DM. The cost-effectiveness ratios of medical treatment, LSG, and LRYGB respectively are 1589.02, 1028.97, and 1197.44 dollars per QALY.Our analysis indicates that LSG appear to provide a cost-effective method of T2DM treatment for the patients.",10.1097/MD.0000000000003522,,,,578
119,Metabolic remission precedes possible weight regain after gastric bypass surgery.,"Some patients regain weight to a variable extent from 1â€‰year after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB), though rarely reaching preoperative values. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether, when, and to what extent metabolic remission occurs. Fasting metabolite and lipid profiles were determined in blood plasma collected from a nonrandomized intervention study involving 148 patients before RYGB and at 2, 12, and 60 months post RYGB. Both short-term and long-term alterations in metabolism were assessed. Anthropometric and clinical variables were assessed at all study visits. This study found that the vast majority of changes in metabolite levels occurred during the first 2â€‰months post RYGB. Notably, thereafter the metabolome started to return toward the presurgical state. Consequently, a close-to-presurgical metabolome was observed at the time when patients reached their lowest weight and glucose level. Lipids with longer acyl chains and a higher degree of unsaturation were altered more dramatically compared with shorter and more saturated lipids, suggesting a systematic and reversible lipid remodeling. Remission of the metabolic state was observed prior to notable weight regain. Further and more long-term studies are required to assess whether the extent of metabolic remission predicts future weight regain and glycemic deterioration.",10.1002/oby.23864,,,,579
1607,Surgery for morbid obesity.,"Obesity is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Surgery for morbid obesity may be considered when other conventional measures have failed, and a number of procedures are available. However, the effects of these surgical procedures compared with medical management and with each other are uncertain. To assess the effects of surgery for morbid obesity on weight, comorbidities and quality of life. We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (issue 4, 2001), Medline (SilverPlatter) up to 2001, PubMed (Internet) 01/01/01-19/10/01, Embase (SilverPlatter) up to 09/2001, PsychINFO up to 10/2001, CINAHL (SilverPlatter) up to 07/2001, Science and Social Sciences Citation Index up to 10/12001, British Nursing Index up to 07/2001, Web of Science Proceedings up to 06/2001, BIOSIS up to10/2001, AMED up to 07/2001, National Research Register (issue 2, 2001), reference lists of relevant articles, and handsearched relevant journals. We also contacted experts in the field. Date of the most recent searches: October 2001. Randomised controlled trials comparing different surgical procedures, and randomised controlled trials and non-randomised controlled trials comparing surgery with non-surgical management for morbid obesity. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked independently by two reviewers. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality. 18 trials involving 1891 people were included. One randomised controlled trial and one non-randomised controlled trial compared surgery with non-surgical management, and 11 randomised controlled trials compared different surgical procedures. The overall quality of the trials was variable, with just one trial having adequate allocation concealment. A meta-analysis was not possible due to differences in the surgical procedures performed, measures of weight change and length of follow-up. Compared with conventional management, surgery resulted in greater weight loss (23-28 kg more weight loss at two years), with improvements in quality of life and comorbidities. Some complications of surgery occurred, such as wound infection. Gastric bypass was associated with greater weight loss and fewer revisions, reoperations and/or conversions than gastroplasty, but had more side-effects. Greater weight loss and fewer side-effects and reoperations occurred with adjustable gastric banding than vertical banded gastroplasty, while vertical banded gastroplasty was associated with greater weight loss but more vomiting than horizontal gastroplasty. Some postoperative deaths occurred in the studies. Weight loss was similar between open and laparoscopic procedures. Fewer serious complications occurred with laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopic surgery had a longer operative time, but resulted in reduced blood loss, reduced proportion of patients requiring intensive care unit stay, reduced length of hospital stay, reduced days to return to activities of daily living and reduced days to return to work. The limited evidence suggests that surgery is more effective than conventional management for weight loss in morbid obesity. The comparative safety and effectiveness of different surgical procedures is unclear.",10.1002/14651858.CD003641,,,,580
948,Impact of Intragastric Balloon Before Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass on Patients with Super Obesity: a Randomized Multicenter Study.,"Super obese patients are recommended to lose weight before bariatric surgery. The effect of intragastric balloon (IGB)-induced weight loss before laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGBP) has not been reported. The aim of this prospective randomized multicenter study was to compare the impact of preoperative 6-month IGB with standard medical care (SMC) in LGBP patients. Patients with BMI >45Â kg/m2 selected for LGBP were included and randomized to receive either SMC or IGB. After 6Â months (M6), the IGB was removed and LGBP was performed in both groups. Postoperative follow-up period was 6Â months (M12). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients requiring ICU stay >24Â h; secondary criteria were weight changes, operative time, hospitalization stay, and perioperative complications. Only 115 patients were included (BMI 54.3Â Â±Â 8.7Â kg/m2), of which 55 underwent IGB insertion. The proportion of patients who stayed in ICU >24Â h was similar in both groups (PÂ =Â 0.87). At M6, weight loss was significantly greater in the IGB group than in the SMC group (PÂ <Â 0.0001). Three severe complications occurred during IGB removal. Mean operative time for LGBP was similar in both groups (PÂ =Â 0.49). Five patients had 1 or more surgical complications, all in the IGB group (PÂ =Â 0.02). Both groups had similar hospitalization stay (PÂ =Â 0.59) and weight loss at M12 (PÂ =Â 0.31). IGB insertion before LGBP induced weight loss but did not improve the perioperative outcomes or affect postoperative weight loss.",10.1007/s11695-016-2383-x,,,,581
421,Predictors of change in cardiovascular disease risk and events following gastric bypass: a 7-year prospective multicenter study.,"Change in short-term (i.e., 10-year) and lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has significant heterogeneity. To identify predictors of change in CVD risk and cardiovascular events following RYGB. Between 2006-2009, 1625 adults without a history of CVD enrolled in a prospective cohort study and underwent RYGB at 1 of 10 U.S. hospitals. Participants were followed annually for a maximum of 7 years. Associations between presurgery characteristics (anthropometric, sociodemographic, physical and mental health, alcohol/drug use, eating behaviors) and 1) pre to postsurgery change in 10 year and lifetime atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk scores, respectively, and 2) having a CVD event (nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, angina, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, or CVD-attributed death) as repeated measures (yr 1-7) were evaluated. Observational cohort study at ten hospitals throughout the United States. Presurgery factors independently associated with decreases in both 10-year and lifetime risk scores 1-7 years post-RYGB were higher CVD risk score, female sex, higher household income, and normal kidney function. Additionally, Black race and having diabetes were independently associated with decreases in 10-year risk, while not having diabetes and a higher (better) composite mental health score were independently related to decreases in lifetime risk. A lower (worse) presurgery composite physical health score was associated with a higher CVD event risk (RR = 1.68, per 10 points). This study identified multiple presurgery factors that characterize patients who may have more cardiovascular benefit from RYGB, and patients who might require additional support to improve their cardiovascular health.",10.1016/j.soard.2020.12.013,,,,582
535,The Prognostic Value of the Dutch Sweet Eating Questionnaire on Weight Loss After Metabolic Surgery: a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) have shown different weight loss results. These differences might be partly due to dumping after LRYGB, forcing sweet eaters to switch to a healthy diet. The Dutch Sweet Eating Questionnaire (DSEQ) is validated to measure sweet eating. This study aims to investigate if sweet eating measured with the DSEQ influences weight loss. In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, patients were included between 2013 and 2017 in two Dutch high-volume hospitals, and randomized with a 1:1 ratio between LRYGB and LSG. Primary outcome measure was weight loss. Secondary outcome measure was sweet eating behavior, measured with the DSEQ. Data was collected at baseline, 1Â year and 2Â years postoperatively. Data was analyzed of 623 patients who underwent LRYGB (nâ€‰=â€‰308; 49.4%) or LSG (nâ€‰=â€‰315; 50.6%). Follow-up rates at 2Â years postoperative were 67.1% for weight and 35.3% for DSEQ. At 2Â years postoperative, mean BMI was significantly higher after LSG than LRYGB (respectively 30.88 versus 28.87Â kg/m2, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and the percentage of sweet eaters was significantly higher after LSG than LRYGB (respectively 8.6% versus 2.6%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.049). None of the preoperative sweet eaters were sweet eaters 2Â years after LRYGB (0.0%), versus 11.8% 2Â years after LSG. No correlation was found between postoperative sweet eating behavior and %EBMIL. No significant correlation was found between preoperative or postoperative sweet eating measured with the DSEQ and weight loss. The decision-making for the procedure type is more complex than weight loss and dietary habits, and should also involve quality of life and presence of comorbidities. These factors should be addressed in future research along with longer term results. Dutch Trial Register NTR-4741.",10.1007/s11695-020-04527-y,,,,583
28,Systematic review of long-term effectiveness of endoscopic gastrojejunostomy in patients presenting with gastric outlet obstruction from periampullary malignancies.,"Recently, endoscopic ultrasound-guided (EUS) gastrojejunostomy (GJ) has emerged as an alternative option to surgical palliation and endoscopic duodenal stenting for malignant gastric outlet obstruction (GOO). Although early success rates are commonly reported with the technique, there is a paucity of data regarding the long-term efficacy of this approach. In this study, we investigated long-term outcomes in patients that underwent EUS-guided GJ for palliation of periampullary malignancies. From a total of 192 studies that were reviewed, 6 studies with a follow-up time frame of a minimum of 5Â months were analyzed, totaling 238 patients. Outcome variables included technical success rate, clinical success rate, adverse events, symptom recurrence, and re-intervention rates. The cohort of 238 patients had a technical success rate of 93.7% and a clinical success rate of 92.9%. A total of 25 patients (10.5%) experienced adverse events associated with EUS-GJ. A total of 14 patients (5.9%) experienced recurrence of GOO symptoms within 5Â months. A total of 14 patients (5.9%) underwent re-intervention with the first 5Â months. This systematic review shows that data are scarce regarding long-term effectiveness of EUS-guided GJ. Even though early success rates have been reported, further studies are needed to focus on long-term efficacy of this approach. Until such studies become available, surgical palliation should continue to be the treatment of choice for patients with malignant GOO with a prolonged life expectancy.",10.1007/s00464-024-10943-3,,,,584
1290,Evaluation of the Swedish adjustable gastric band VC (SAGB-VC) in an Australian population: early results.,"The Swedish adjustable gastric band VC (SAGB-VC) has been in use in Australia since 2007. We evaluated its efficacy and safety. We retrospectively analyzed the prospective clinical data of patients who received the implant between November 2007 and June 2009 at 3 Australian bariatric centres. In all, 1176 patients (mean age 45.9 [standard deviation (SD) 12.3] yr, mean body mass index 43.4 [SD 7.6]) received the SAGB-VC. At a mean follow-up of 11 (SD 3) months, weight reduced by a mean of 18.4 (SD 11.1) kg with an excess weight loss of 37.8% (SD 19.9%). Body mass index decreased (from mean 43.4 [SD 7.7] to mean 36.7 [SD 6.5], p < 0.001). Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) was reported in 167 patients and hypertension in 373. Improvement occurred in 73.5% of patients with T2DM and 31% with hypertension, with patient-reported reduction or cessation of medication. Metabolic syndrome indices improved during follow-up: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (mean 1.3 [SD 0.3] v. mean 1.4 [SD 0.3] mmol/L, p < 0.001), triglycerides (mean 1.6 [SD 0.8] v. mean 1.3 [SD 0.7] mmol/L, p < 0.001), waist circumference (men 141 [SD 103] to 121 [SD 15] cm, women 117 [SD 14] to 105 [SD 14] cm, both p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (90.5 [SD 75.2] v. 53.3 [SD 61.9] nmol/L, p < 0.001). The complication rate was 4.2%. The SAGB-VC is safe and effective for treating obesity and its comorbidities. The results are reproducible in separate Australian centres and consistent with published literature.",10.1503/cjs.011511,,,,585
601,Bariatric Surgery Among Medicare Subgroups: Short- and Long-Term Outcomes.,"This study sought to examine weight change, postoperative adverse events, and related outcomes of interest among age-qualified (AQ) and disability-qualified (DQ) Medicare recipients compared with non-Medicare (NM) patients undergoing anÂ initial bariatric procedure. The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS-2) is an observational cohort study of 2,458 adults who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) bariatric surgery. Weight, percentage body fat, functional status, and comorbidities, as well as postoperative adverse events, were assessed at baseline and annually for 5 years. The 1,943 participants who reported insurance typeÂ were categorized into the following groups: AQ, DQ, or NM. The median preoperative BMI ranged from 45 to 48 kg/m2 across groups. For RYGB, 5-year BMI loss was approximately 30% for all groups, and for LAGB, BMI loss was 12% to 15%. Diabetes remission after 5 years was also similar across groups within procedure types (RYGB: 33%-40%; LAGB: 13%-19%). The frequency of adverse events after RYGB ranged from 4.1% for NM participants to 6.7% for DQ participants. After LAGB, there were no adverse events for the AQ group, whereas 3% of DQ participants and 1.8% of NM participants had at leastÂ one adverse event. Medicare participants experienced substantial BMI loss and diabetes remission, with a frequency of adverse events similar to that of NM participants.",10.1002/oby.22613,,,,586
164,Five-year Comorbidity Outcomes in Laparoscopic Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (LVSG) and Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB): A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy (LVSG) is now the most commonly performed bariatric procedure; however, it remains to be elucidated if it delivers equivalent long-term comorbid disease resolution outcomes similar to the longer established laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate the comparative 5-year outcomes of both procedures. Electronic databases (Pubmed, EMBASE, CINAHL) were searched for RCTs conducted in adults (>18y) that compared the 5-year- outcomes of LVSG to LRYGB and described comorbidity outcomes were included. Where data allowed, effect sizes were calculated using the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman estimation method for random effects model. Presence of bias was assessed with Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 and funnel plots, and certainty of evidence evaluated by GRADE. The study prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018112054). Three RCTs (LVSG=254, LRYGB=255) met inclusion criteria and reported on chronic disease outcomes. Improvement and/or resolution of hypertension favoured LRYGB (odds ratio 0.49, 95% CI 0.29, 0.84; P =0.03). Trends favoring LRYGB were seen for type 2 diabetes and dysplidemia, and LVSG for sleep apnea and back/joint conditions ( P >0.05). The certainty of evidence associated with each assessed outcome ranged from low to very low, in the setting of 'some' to 'high' bias assessed as being present. Both LRYGB and LVSG are effective in providing long-term improvements in commonly experienced obesity-related comorbidities; however, the limited certainty of the evidence does not allow for strong clinical conclusions to be made at this time regarding benefit of one procedure over the other.",10.1097/SLE.0000000000001156,,,,587
1584,Laparoscopic vertical banded gastroplasty and laparoscopic gastric bypass: a comparison.,"Vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) and gastric bypass (GBP) are the two bariatric procedures recommended by NIH consensus conference. Recent advancement in laparoscopic (L) techniques has made LVBG and LGBP alternatives for the conventional open approach. From December 2000 to February 2002, 80 patients (24 men and 56 women; mean age 32 years, range 18-57) with morbid obesity (mean BMI 43.2 kg/m(2), range 36-59.8) were enrolled in a prospective trial and randomly assigned to LVBG or LGBP. Changes in quality of life were assessed using the Gastro-intestinal quality of life index (GIQLI). The conversion rate was zero for LVBG and 2.5% (1/40) for LGBP. There has been no mortality. Surgical time was significantly longer for LGBP (209 minvs 126 min for LVBG, P<0.001). Mean hospital stay was 3.5 days for the LVBG vs 5.7 days for LGBP (P<0.001). Postoperative analgesic usage was also less for LVBG patients (mean dose 1.4 vs 2.4, P<0.05). Early complication rate was higher in the LGBP group (17.8% vs 2.5%, P<0.001). All 3 major complications were in the LGBP group, of which 2 were related to anastomotic leakage (5%). Late complications consisted of upper GI bleeding, stenosis and others observed in 4 LGBP patients (10%) and 2 LVBG patients (5%). Mean follow-up was 20 months (range 18 to 30). BMI fell significantly in both groups, with significant improvement of obesity-related co-morbidities. LGBP had significantly better excess weight loss than LVBG (62.9% vs 55.4% at 1 year and 71.4% vs 53.1% at 2 years), as well as lower BMI than LVBG (29.6 vs 31.1 at 1 year and 28.5 vs 31.9 at 2 years). There was no difference in the reduction of obesity-related laboratory abnormalities at 1 year except a lower hemoglobin in LGBP (11.8 vs 13.8, P<0.05). Preoperative GIQLI scores were similar between the groups; however, at 1 year, LGBP patients had better GIOLI scores than LVBG patients (121 vs 106, P<0.01). LVBG had improvement in physical condition, social function and emotional conditioning but deterioration in GI symptoms which resulted in no increase in total GIQLI score. LGBP was a time-consuming demanding technique with a higher early complication rate compared with LVBG. Although both operations resulted in significant weight reduction and decrease in obesity-related co-morbidities, LGBP had a trend of greater weight loss and significantly better GIQLI than LVBG at the cost of a significant long-term trace element deficiency state. Each patient should be individualized for the operations according to the patient's decision.",10.1381/096089204323093390,,,,588
1068,Endoscopic Therapeutic Option for Weight Loss and Control of Type 2 Diabetes: the Duodenal-Jejunal Bypass Liner.,"For a long time, obesity has been known as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which is one of the main causes of death in developed countries. This risk is due to the coexistence of other factors associated with obesity, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and abnormalities in glycemic metabolism. Obesity is also a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, and it is not surprising that the global prevalence of this disease continues to increase. Surgical intervention is now the most effective modality to treat severe obesity and its comorbidities. However, endoluminal interventions performed entirely through the gastrointestinal tract by using endoscopic devices offer the potential for an outpatient weight loss procedure that may be safer, less invasive, and more cost-effective, compared with current surgical approaches. Given the emerging role of endoscopic procedures in the treatment of obesity and rapid changes in endoscopic technologies and techniques, this review considers the current state of endoscopic management of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Endoscopic techniques attempt to mimic some of the anatomic features of bariatric surgery and rely on gastric restriction and duodenal exclusion. The endoscopic placement of the duodenal-jejunal bypass liner in morbidly obese patients induces significant weight loss. Additionally, early studies reported significant improvements in several parameters of glucose homeostasis in morbidly obese patients with type 2 diabetes. In this article we will review the available results obtained with the duodenal-jejunal bypass liner.",,,,,589
1453,Vitamin status after bariatric surgery: a randomized study of gastric bypass and duodenal switch.,"Bariatric surgery is widely performed to induce weight loss. The objective was to examine changes in vitamin status after 2 bariatric surgical techniques. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2 Scandinavian hospitals. The subjects were 60 superobese patients [body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)): 50-60]. The surgical interventions were either laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or laparoscopic biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. All patients received multivitamins, iron, calcium, and vitamin D supplements. Gastric bypass patients also received a vitamin B-12 substitute. The patients were examined before surgery and 6 wk, 6 mo, and 1 y after surgery. Of 60 surgically treated patients, 59 completed the follow-up. After surgery, duodenal switch patients had lower mean vitamin A and 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and a steeper decline in thiamine concentrations than did the gastric bypass patients. Other vitamins (riboflavin, vitamin B-6, vitamin C, and vitamin E adjusted for serum lipids) did not change differently in the surgical groups, and concentrations were either stable or increased. Furthermore, duodenal switch patients had lower hemoglobin and total cholesterol concentrations and a lower BMI (mean reduction: 41% compared with 30%) than did gastric bypass patients 1 y after surgery. Additional dietary supplement use was more frequent among duodenal switch patients (55%) than among gastric bypass patients (26%). Compared with gastric bypass, duodenal switch may be associated with a greater risk of vitamin A and D deficiencies in the first year after surgery and of thiamine deficiency in the initial months after surgery. Patients who undergo these 2 surgical interventions may require different monitoring and supplementation regimens in the first year after surgery. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00327912.",10.3945/ajcn.2009.27583,,,,590
894,Outcomes of laparoscopic gastric bypass in a randomized clinical trial compared with a concurrent national database.,"RCTs are the standard for assessing medical interventions, but they may not be feasible and their external validity is sometimes questioned. This study aimed to compare results from an RCT on mesenteric defect closure during laparoscopic gastric bypass with those from a national database containing data on the same procedure, to shed light on the external validity of the RCT. Patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery within an RCT conducted between 1 May 2010 and 14 November 2011 were compared with those who underwent the same procedure in Sweden outside the RCT over the same time interval. Primary endpoints were severe complications within 30 days and surgery for small bowel obstruction within 4 years. Some 2507 patients in the RCT were compared with 8485 patients in the non-RCT group. There were no differences in severe complications within 30 days in the group without closure of the mesenteric defect (odds ratio (OR) for RCT versus non-RCT 0Â·94, 95 per cent c.i. 0Â·64 to 1Â·36; Pâ€‰=â€‰0Â·728) or in the group with closure of the defect (OR 1Â·34, 0Â·96 to 1Â·86; Pâ€‰=â€‰0Â·087). There were no differences between the RCT and non-RCT cohorts in reoperation rates for small bowel obstruction in the mesenteric defect non-closure (cumulative incidence 10Â·9 versus 9Â·4 per cent respectively; hazard ratio (HR) 1Â·20, 95 per cent c.i. 0Â·99 to 1Â·46; Pâ€‰=â€‰0Â·065) and closure (cumulative incidence 5Â·7 versus 7Â·0 per cent; HR 0Â·82, 0Â·62 to 1Â·07; Pâ€‰=â€‰0Â·137) groups. The relative risk for small bowel obstruction without mesenteric defect closure compared with closure was 1Â·91 in the RCT group and 1Â·39 in the non-RCT group. The efficacy of mesenteric defect closure was similar in the RCT and national registry, providing evidence for the external validity of the RCT.",10.1002/bjs.10448,,,,591
1314,Percutaneous transhepatic biliary stenting vs. surgical bypass in advanced malignant biliary obstruction: cost- effectiveness analysis.,"This study aims to compare the clinical outcomes and costs between percutaneous transhepatic biliary stenting (PTBS) and surgical bypass. We randomly assigned 142 patients with unresectable malignant biliary obstruction between 2005 and 2010 to receive PTBS or surgical bypass as palliative treatment. PTBS was successfully performed in 70 patients who formed the PTBS group (failed in 7 patients). Sixty five patients underwent surgical bypass treatment. Additional gastrojejunostomy was performed in five patients. The effectiveness of biliary drainage, hospital stay, complications, cost, survival time and mortality were compared. Patients in PTBS group had shorter hospital stay and lower initial and overall expense than the surgical group (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in effectiveness of biliary drainage (p=0.9307) or survival time between two groups (p=0.4826). Early complications of PTBS group was significantly lower than surgical group (3/75 vs. 11/65, p=0.0342). Late complication in PTBS group did not differ significantly from surgical group (9/70 vs. 6/65, p=0.6823). The survival curves in the two groups showed no significant difference (p=0.1032). PTBD is a better palliative treatment than surgical bypass for unresectable malignant biliary obstruction for its high effectiveness of biliary drainage and acceptable expense and complication.",10.5754/hge12324,,,,592
474,Standardized reporting of co-morbidity outcome after bariatric surgery: low compliance with the ASMBS outcome reporting standards despite ease of use.,"Despite the publication of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) Outcome Reporting Standards in 2015, there is still a great variety in definitions used for reporting remission of co-morbidities after bariatric surgery. This hampers meaningful comparison of results. To assess compliance with the ASMBS standards in current literature, and to evaluate use of the standards by applying them in a report on the outcomes of 5 co-morbidities after bariatric surgery. Two clinics of the Dutch Obesity Clinic, location Den Haag and Velp, and three affiliated hospitals: Haaglanden Medical Center in Den Haag, Groene Hart Hospital in Gouda, and Vitalys Clinic in Velp. A systematic search in PubMed was conducted to identify studies using the ASMBS standards. Besides, the standards were applied to a cohort of patients who underwent a primary bariatric procedure between November 2016 and June 2017. Outcomes of co-morbidities were determined at 6 and 12 months after surgery. Ten previous studies applying ASMBS definitions were identified by the search, including 6 studies using portions of the definitions, and 4 using complete definitions for 3 co-morbidities or in a small population. In this study, the standards were applied to 1064 patients, of whom 796 patients (75%) underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and 268 patients (25%) underwent sleeve gastrectomy. At 12 months, complete remission of diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin <6%, off medication) was reached in 63%, partial remission (glycosylated hemoglobin 6%-6.4%, off medication) in 7%, and improvement in 28% of patients (n = 232/248, 94%). Complete remission of hypertension (normotensive, off medication) was noted in 8%, partial remission (prehypertensive, off medication) in 23% and improvement in 63% (n = 397/412, 96%). Remission rate for dyslipidemia (normal nonhigh-density lipoprotein, off medication) was 57% and improvement rate was 19% (n = 129/133, 97%). Resolution of gastroesophageal reflux disease (no symptoms, off medication) was observed in 54% (n = 265/265). Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome improved in 90% (n = 157/169, 93%). Compliance with the ASMBS standards is low, despite ease of use. Standardized definitions provided by the ASMBS guideline could be used in future research to enable comparison of outcomes of different studies and surgical procedures.",10.1016/j.soard.2020.07.011,,,,593
1549,"Clinical evaluation of fibrin glue in the prevention of anastomotic leak and internal hernia after laparoscopic gastric bypass: preliminary results of a prospective, randomized multicenter trial.","Gastro-jejunal anastomotic leak and internal hernia can be life-threatening complications of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP), ranging from 0.1-4.3% and from 0.8-4.5% respectively. The safety and efficacy of a fibrin glue (Tissucol) was assessed when placed around the anastomoses and over the mesenteric openings for prevention of anastomotic leaks and internal hernias after LRYGBP. A prospective, randomized, multicenter, clinical trial commenced in January 2004. Patients with BMI 40-59 kg/m2, aged 21-60 years, undergoing LRYGBP, were randomized into: 1) study group (fibrin glue applied on the gastro-jejunal and jejuno-jejunal anastomoses and the mesenteric openings); 2) control group (no fibrin glue, but suture of the mesenteric openings). 322 patients, 161 for each arm, will be enrolled for an estimated period of 24 months. Sex, age, operative time, time to postoperative oral diet and hospital stay, early and late complications rates are evaluated. An interim evaluation was conducted after 15 months. To April 2005, 204 patients were randomized: 111 in the control group (mean age 39.0+/-11.6 years, BMI 46.4 +/- 8.2) and 93 in the fibrin glue group (mean age 42.9+/-11.7 years, BMI 46.9+/-6.4). There was no mortality or conversion in both groups; no differences in operative time and postoperative hospital stay were recorded. Time to postoperative oral diet was shorter for the fibrin glue group (P = 0.0044). Neither leaks nor internal hernias have occurred in the fibrin glue group. The incidence of leaks (2 cases, 1.8%) and the overall reoperation rate were higher in the control group (P=0.0165). The preliminary results suggest that Tissucol application has no adverse effects, is not time-consuming, and may be effective in preventing leaks and internal hernias in morbidly obese patients undergoing LRYGBP.",10.1381/096089206775565249,,,,594
353,The Impact of Bariatric Surgery Versus Non-Surgical Treatment on Blood Pressure: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The purpose of this study was to compare bariatric surgery versus non-surgical treatment on blood pressure for patients with obesity. Nineteen RCTs (1353 total patients) were included. In the pooled analyses, bariatric surgery reduces more systolic blood pressure (WMD:â€‰-â€‰3.937Â mmHg, CI95%:â€‰-â€‰6.000 toâ€‰-â€‰1.875, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001, I2â€‰=â€‰0%), diastolic blood pressure (WMD:â€‰-â€‰2.690Â mmHg, CI95%:â€‰-â€‰3.994 toâ€‰-â€‰1.385, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001, I2â€‰=â€‰0%) and more antihypertensives. In subgroup analyses, patients after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, with poor control of hypertension (BPâ€‰>â€‰130/80Â mmHg) and diabetes mellitus (HbA1Câ€‰>â€‰7.0%, FPGâ€‰>â€‰7.0Â mmol/L), elder patients (>â€‰45Â years), non-severe obesity (BMIâ€‰<â€‰40Â kg/cm2, body weightâ€‰<â€‰120Â kg), less waist circumference (<â€‰115Â cm) tend to decrease more blood pressure. Besides, patients after surgery also lost more weight (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), decreased more waist circumference (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), fasting plasma glucose (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), glycosylated hemoglobin (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), triglycerides (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), hsCRP (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001), increased more high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and had better remission of metabolic syndrome (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Changes in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, renal function, resting heart rate, and 6-min walking test were not significantly different. Therefore, bariatric surgery is more effective than non-surgical treatment in controlling patients' blood pressure.",10.1007/s11695-021-05671-9,,,,595
1586,Post-anesthesia recovery after infusion of propofol with remifentanil or alfentanil or fentanyl in morbidly obese patients.,"The type of opioid used during general anesthesia in the morbidly obese influences recovery and the postoperative period. In a randomized clinical trial, the postoperative recovery profile and early period after general anesthesia with remifentanil, fentanyl and alfentanil were compared in morbidly obese patients. 60 morbidly obese patients with BMI >35 kg/m(2) (mean 43.31) undergoing open Roux-en-y gastric bypass were randomly divided into 3 groups: remifentanil (R), fentanyl (F), and alfentanil (A). Dosage of opioids was based on ideal body weight (IBW): fentanyl 5 mcg/kg for intubation followed by infusion of 0.025-0.05 mcg/kg/min; alfentanil 15 mcg/kg initially, then 1.0-1.5 mcg kg/min; and remifentanil 1 mcg/kg followed by infusion of 0.25-1.5 mcg/kg/min. Anesthesia was induced with infusion of propofol and oxygen with N(2)O (1:1). After anesthesia, the duration to response to verbal command, spontaneous respiration, adequate respiration, and safe extubation were recorded. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting were recorded. Using verbal scale for evaluation of postoperative pain, the early postoperative analgesia requirements were assessed. Demographic profiles and duration of procedure did not differ between groups. A total dose of propofol was significantly lower in Group R compared with Groups A and F (P <0.05). Duration to spontaneous respiration, adequate respiration and safe extubation were significantly shorter in Group R compared with Group F (P <0.05). Shortly after anesthesia, significantly more patients in Group R required additional dose of analgesic than in Group F (P <0.05). Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) occurred significantly more often in Group R compared with Group F (P <0.05). Recovery profile of Group A was more similar to Group R, and postoperative pain and PONV evaluation more similar to Group F. In morbidly obese individuals, alfentanil or fentanyl and remifentanil can be safely used, but there is a higher rate of PONV and postoperative pain in the remifentanil group.",10.1381/096089204323013488,,,,596
1165,Primary banded Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a systematic review.,"Primary banding of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass remains controversial. Though there are surgeons who believe it should be the standard practice as it results in superior weight loss and prevents weight regain in the long term, there are others who are concerned about the risk of food intolerance and complications related to band. This review investigates published English language literature systematically to find out the advantages and disadvantages of primary banding of a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.",10.1007/s11695-014-1346-3,,,,597
238,The effects of bariatric surgery on cognition in patients with obesity: aÂ systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Obesity impairs cognition. Bariatric surgery can result in substantial weight loss in patients with severe obesity; however, the impact of bariatric surgery on cognitive function remains controversial. To quantify the effect of bariatric surgery on cognition in patients with severe obesity, we performed a meta-analysis of 20 studies retrieved from PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase. Of these, 6 cohort studies found that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass leads to better performance for immediate verbal memory function (standardized mean difference [SMD] = .56; 95% confidence interval [CI]: .30-.82, P < .0001; I2 = 0%) and delayed memory function (SMD = .64; 95% CI: .38-.90, P < .00001; I2 = 0%) during in the short term. Similarly, positive impacts on immediate verbal memory function (SMD = .46; 95% CI: .09-.83, P < .00001) and delayed memory function (SMD = .84; 95% CI: .46-1.22, P < .0001) were identified during a long-term follow-up. The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass group showed no improvements in attention, cognitive speed, and executive function compared with the control obese group. In 14 longitudinal studies (12 single-arm pre-post comparison studies and 2 cohort studies whose control group had no follow-up cognitive data), patients performed better postoperatively than preoperatively in all cognitive domains during repeated assessments. The analysis for the 20 operative groups showed that individuals treated with bariatric surgery had higher scores after repeated assessment of most neuropsychological tests except for animal fluency and letter fluency than baseline scores. These findings suggest that patients with severe obesity may obtain immediate verbal and delayed memory function benefits from Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.",10.1016/j.soard.2022.07.007,,,,598
1656,Results of the surgical treatment of obesity.,"A prospective, randomized trial comparing vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) and vertical gastric bypass (GB) for obesity was completed in 106 patients who did not differ in baseline body mass index (BMI = kg/m2) or length of follow-up. The goal of this surgery was to return patients to within 50% of their ideal weight, i.e., a body mass index less than 35 kg/m2, and to accomplish this while maintaining a low risk for malnutrition as well as other morbidity and mortality. Success was defined as a BMI less than 35 kg/m2 because the mortality risk increases rapidly above this degree of obesity. Surgical failures were encountered in 43% of the 54 patients in the VBG group, all of whom had division between the vertical staple lines. The main causes of failure were stenosis and enlargement of the gastroplasty orifice. Surgery failed in 23% of the GB-treated patients, due to perforation of the vertical staple line. An isolated gastric bypass (IGB) not dependent on staples was performed as the remedial operation for the failures of both VBG and GB. IGB was significantly better than VBG or GB, with a success rate of 83% compared with 39% for VBG and 58% for GB. Subsequent experience since completion of this randomized trial in 54 consecutive patients supports IGB for primary, as well as remedial, operations for the morbidly obese (BMI = 40 to 50 kg/m2), as well as for patients who are super obese (BMI greater than 50 kg/m2).",10.1016/s0002-9610(05)80420-9,,,,599
864,Obstructive sleep apnea: the effect of bariatric surgery after 12Â months. A prospective multicenter trial.,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep disorder, particularly in bariatric patients. It is known to be tightly linked with metabolic abnormalities and cardiovascular morbidity. Obesity is the most noteworthy individual risk factor for OSA. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) on OSA one year after surgery. In this prospective multicenter study standard overnight cardiorespiratory recording was conducted 12 months after bariatric surgery in 132 patients who had OSA in the baseline recording prior to the operation. The main outcome measures were changes in the prevalence of OSA and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). In addition, the changes in anthropometric and demographic measurements including weight, body mass index (BMI), and waist and neck circumference were evaluated. A sleep symptom questionnaire was administered at baseline and at 12 months. The prevalence of OSA decreased from 71% at baseline to 44% at 12 months after surgery (pÂ <Â 0.001). OSA was cured in 45% and cured or improved in 78% of the patients, but moderate or severe OSA still persisted in 20% of the patients after the operation. De novo OSA occurred in eight percent of the patients, and total AHI decreased from 27.8 events/h to 9.9 events/h (pÂ <Â 0.001). LRYGB is effective in treating OSA. However, the findings demonstrate that a postoperative cardiorespiratory recording is needed in order to identify the patients with persistent moderate to severe OSA after the operation.

451,Comparison of gastrojejunostomy techniques and anastomotic complications: a systematic literature review.,"There are several ways to perform the gastrojejunostomy (GJ) anastomosis in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). Surgeons typically use a variation of three techniques: Hand-sewn anastomosis (HSA), Linear stapled (LS) and Circular stapled anastomosis (CSA). The purpose of this literature review is to determine which of the GJ techniques, if any, is superior and results in the least amount of postoperative complications, with a specific focus on rates of marginal ulcers, postoperative bleeding, and strictures. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane electronic databases were consulted for studies on LRYGB procedures utilizing a GJ anastomosis, from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2019. Cochrane and PRISMA screening methods were used to select the studies. Eleven studies published between 2015 and 2019 were selected and included 135,899 patients that underwent LRYGB with a GJ anastomosis. Sample sizes ranged from 114 to 49,331 patients. Four studies reported that CSA had statistically significant higher rates of marginal ulcers when compared to HSA and LS techniques. Three studies concluded that CSA had statistically significant higher rates of postoperative bleeding when compared to HSA and LS. Five studies observed that CSA had statistically significant higher rates of strictures when compared to HSA and LS techniques. There was no consensus whether HSA or LS was superior in terms of reduced postoperative complications. This study revealed statistically significant increases in rates of postoperative bleeding, marginal ulcer, and strictures with the use of mechanical circular staplers at the GJ anastomosis in LRYGB. Based on our results, avoiding the use of mechanical circular staplers can result in fewer postoperative complications. Nevertheless, there are limitations to retrospective studies which may influence the results and therefore a randomized controlled trial directly comparing HSA, CSA, and LS should be performed to truly determine which technique is superior.",10.1007/s00464-020-08142-x,,,,601
1341,Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity and diabetes remission at 1 month after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in patients randomized to omentectomy.,"Early after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), there is improvement in type 2 diabetes, which is characterized by insulin resistance. We determined the acute effects of RYGB, with and without omentectomy, on hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity. We also investigated whether preoperative diabetes or postoperative diabetes remission influenced tissue-specific insulin sensitivity after RYGB. We studied 40 obese (BMI 48 Â± 8 kg/m(2)) participants, 17 with diabetes. Participants were randomized to RYGB alone or in conjunction with omentectomy. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps with isotopic-tracer infusion were completed at baseline and at 1 month postoperatively to assess insulin sensitivity. Participants lost 11 Â± 4% of body weight at 1 month after RYGB, without an improvement in peripheral insulin sensitivity; these outcomes were not affected by omentectomy, preoperative diabetes, or remission of diabetes. Hepatic glucose production (HGP) and the hepatic insulin sensitivity index improved in all subjects, irrespective of omentectomy (P â‰¤ 0.001). Participants with diabetes had higher baseline HGP values (P = 0.003) that improved to a greater extent after RYGB (P = 0.006). Of the 17 participants with diabetes, 10 (59%) had remission at 1 month. Diabetes remission had a group Ã— time effect (P = 0.041) on HGP; those with diabetes remission had lower preoperative and postoperative HGP. Peripheral insulin sensitivity did not improve 1 month after RYGB, irrespective of omentectomy, diabetes, or diabetes remission. Hepatic insulin sensitivity improved at 1 month after RYGB and was more pronounced in patients with diabetes. Improvement in HGP may influence diabetes remission early after RYGB.",10.2337/dc11-1383,,,,602
15,Safety and Efficacy of Barbed Sutures Compared to Non-barbed Sutures in Bariatric Surgery: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Mastering intracorporeal suturing is challenging in the evolution from conventional to laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Among various techniques competing for superiority in overcoming this hurdle, we focus on exploring the potential of barbed sutures through a meta-analysis that compares outcomes to those of conventional non-barbed sutures in bariatric surgery. We conducted a comprehensive search on PubMed, Scopus, and Embase to identify studies comparing barbed sutures with non-barbed sutures in bariatric surgeries, focusing on outcomes such as operative time, suturing time, postoperative complications, and hospital stay. The statistical analysis was carried out using RStudio version 4.3.2. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane Q test and I2 statistics. Incorporating data from 11 studies involving a total of 27,442 patients, including 3,516 in the barbed suture group across various bariatric surgeries, our analysis demonstrates a significant reduction in suturing time (mean difference -4.87; 95% CI -8.43 to -1.30; pâ€‰<â€‰0.01; I2â€‰=â€‰99%) associated with the use of barbed sutures. Specifically, in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, we observed a significant decrease in operative time (mean difference -12.11; 95% CI -19.27 to -4.95; pâ€‰<â€‰0.01; I2â€‰=â€‰93%). Subgroup analyses and leave-one-out analyses consistently supported these findings. Furthermore, we found that the mean body mass index did not significantly predict the mean difference in operative time outcome. No significant differences emerged in hospital stay or postoperative complications, including leak, bleeding, stenosis, and bowel obstruction (pâ€‰>â€‰0.05). Our study findings address barbed sutures as a potential alternative for laparoscopic intracorporeal suturing in bariatric surgery.",10.1007/s11695-024-07382-3,,,,603
910,"Influence of bariatric surgery on quality of life, body image, and general self-efficacy within 6 and 24 months-a prospective cohort study.","It has been proven that bariatric surgery affects weight loss. Patients with morbid obesity have a significantly lower quality of life (QOL) and body image compared with the general population. To evaluate QOL, body image, and general self-efficacy (GSE) in patients with morbid obesity undergoing bariatric surgery within clinical parameters. Monocentric, prospective, longitudinal cohort study. Patients completed the short form 36 (SF-36) for QOL, body image questionnaire, and GSE scale 3 times: before surgery and within 6 months and 24 months after surgery. Influence of gender, age, and type of procedure, either laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, were analyzed. Thirty patients completed the questionnaires before and within 6 and 24 months after surgery. SF-36 physical summary score improved significantly from 34.3Â±11.0 before surgery to 46.0Â±10.4 within 6 months (P<.001) and to 49.8Â±8.2 within 24 months (P<.001) after surgery. SF-36 mental summary score improved significantly from 42.1Â±14.7 before surgery to 52.3Â±8.4 within 6 months (P<.001) and to 48.4Â±12.2 within 24 months (P<.001) after surgery. There were no significant differences between gender, age, and type of operation. Body image and GSE improved significantly after bariatric surgery (P<.001), and both correlated to the SF-36 mental summary score. QOL, body image, and GSE improved significantly within 6 months and remained stable within 24 months after bariatric surgery. Improvements were independent of gender, age, and type of operation. Mental QOL was influenced by body image and GSE.",10.1016/j.soard.2016.08.017,,,,604
809,Glycemic Control after Sleeve Gastrectomy and Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass in Obese Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) has weight-independent effects on glycemia in obese type 2 diabetic patients, whereas sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is less well characterized. This study aims to compare early weight-independent and later weight-dependent glycemic effects of LRYGB and LSG. Eighteen LRYGB and 15 LSG patients were included in the study. Glucose, insulin, GLP-1, and GIP levels were monitored during a modified 30Â g oral glucose tolerance test before surgery and 2Â days, 3Â weeks, and 12Â months after surgery. Patients self-monitored glucose levels 2Â weeks before and after surgery. Postoperative fasting blood glucose decreased similarly in both groups (LRYGB vs. SG; baseline-8.1â€‰Â±â€‰0.6 vs. 8.2â€‰Â±â€‰0.4Â mmol/l, 2Â days-7.8â€‰Â±â€‰0.5 vs. 7.4â€‰Â±â€‰0.3Â mmol/l, 3Â weeks-6.6â€‰Â±â€‰0.4 vs. 6.6â€‰Â±â€‰0.3Â mmol/l, respectively, PÂ <â€‰0.01 vs. baseline for both groups; 12Â months-6.6â€‰Â±â€‰0.4 vs. 5.9â€‰Â±â€‰0.4, respectively, PÂ <â€‰0.05 for LRYGB and PÂ <â€‰0.001 for LSG vs. baseline, PÂ =â€‰ns between the groups at all times). LSG, but not LRYGB, showed increased peak insulin levels 2Â days postoperatively (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEM; LSG +â€‰58â€‰Â±â€‰14%, PÂ <â€‰0.01; LRYGB -â€‰8â€‰Â±â€‰17%, PÂ =â€‰ns). GLP-1 levels increased similarly at 2Â days, but were higher in LRYGB at 3Â weeks (AUC; 7525â€‰Â±â€‰1258 vs. 4779â€‰Â±â€‰712Â pmolâ€‰Ã—â€‰min, respectively, PÂ <â€‰0.05). GIP levels did not differ.

615,Preoperative intragastric balloon in morbid obesity is unable to decrease early postoperative morbidity of bariatric surgery (sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass): a clinical assay.,"There are few studies that investigate the usefulness of the preoperative intragastric balloon (IGB). This study will evaluate if pre-surgical weight loss with IGB reduces morbidity and mortality after surgery. Prospective randomised study of patients with morbid obesity treated with gastric bypass or vertical gastrectomy, with two arms: the balloon arm (B-arm), where an IGB was inserted within the 6 months before surgery, and the control arm (C-arm). The study included 66 patients: 65.6% women, 69.6% with bypass. Age: 43Â years (SD 10.2) B-arm and 42.6Â years (SD 9.2) in the C-arm. We found 34.4% therapeutic failures in IGB. The mean body weight loss, %EWL and BMI reduction before surgery was 16.2Â kg (SD 9.84) B-arm versus 4.7 (SD 8.70) in the C-arm, 23.6% versus 4.7% (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and 6.04 versus 1 (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), respectively. The hospital stay was 7 days (p25-75: 5-8) B-arm and 7Â days (p25-75: 5-9) in the C-arm (p = 0.937). Post-surgical morbidity with IGB was 25% versus 29.5% in the C-arm, p = 0.689. The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent of post-surgical morbidity was 23 patients. The B-arm presented 54.5% moderate-severe post-surgical adverse events (12.5%) versus 82.6% in the C-arm (23.5%), p = 0.111. The cost of placing a balloon was more than 4000 Euros each. The preoperative balloon does not achieve a reduction in the post-surgical morbidity, nor does it reduce the hospital stay or rate of re-operations.

1154,The efficacy of prophylactic IVC filters in gastric bypass surgery.,"Patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery have a high risk for thromboembolic events. Over the last decade, the use of prophylactic IVC filters (IVCF) has drastically increased for patients who are considered high risk. However, the role and efficacy of prophylactic IVCF placement remain controversial, and the literature is limited to a few retrospective studies. We conducted a systematic review of the literature. A total of 21 articles were analyzed, and eight relevant retrospective studies were chosen for review of data. Data from laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery were compared to open gastric bypass surgery The relevant eight retrospective studies included a total of 597 patients. Patients had IVCFs before laparoscopic gastric bypass (41Â %) and before open gastric bypass (59Â %). There were 5 postoperative pulmonary emboli (PE) (0.84Â %), 21 DVTs (3.52Â %), 5 minor IVCF-related complications (0.84Â %), 2 major IVCF-related complications (0.34Â %), and 10 deaths (1.68Â %). The rate of postoperative PE was the same in the laparoscopic group and the open group (0.84Â %). The rate of DVT in the laparoscopic group was 5.02Â %, and in the open group, it was 2.23Â %. It is estimated that 55Â % of bariatric surgeons use IVCF in high-risk patients. Prospective research that supports the use of IVCF is very limited, and individualized placement relies on retrospective studies only. In addition, patient characteristics associated with high risk vary between different studies. Our review showed that most of the published studies support the use of prophylactic IVCF and found it to be safe. On the other hand, the largest and most recent retrospective cohort study does not support their use. The efficacy of prophylactic IVCFs before gastric bypass surgery in high-risk patients has not been established.",10.1007/s00464-014-3746-9,,,,607
539,Surgical outcome of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for resolution of type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Bariatric procedures are considered superior to medical therapies in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) are the most commonly used procedures for weight loss and comorbidity resolution worldwide. However, it is not yet known whether the degree of T2DM is influenced by the choice of bariatric procedure. To quantitatively compare T2DM resolution over 1-5 years follow-up by LRYGB and LSG in morbidly obese patients. We searched the selected databases for full-text English language clinical studies that compared the effectiveness of LRYGB and LSG for T2DM resolution. Review manager 5.3 was used for data analysis, and the overall effect summary was represented in a forest plot. From 1,650 titles retrieved by an initial search, we selected nine studies for this research. We found insignificant differences for T2DM resolution by LRYGB and LSG, with an odds ratio of 0.93 (95%CI: 0.64-1.35, Z statistics = 0.38, P = 0.71). Additionally, subset analyses for T2DM resolution showed insignificant differences after 24 mo (Ï‡ 2 = 1.24, df = 4, P = 0.87, overall Z effect = 0.23), 36 mo (Ï‡ 2 = 0.41, df = 2, P = 0.81, overall Z effect = 0.51), and 60 mo (Ï‡ 2 = 4.75, df = 3, P = 0.19, overall Z effect = 1.20) by LRYGB and LSG. This study reports a T2DM remission rate of 82.3% by LRYGB and 80.7% by LSG. This study reports similar T2DM resolution rates by both LRYGB and LSG during 1-5 years of follow-up. However, long-term follow-up of 10 years is needed to further substantiate these findings.",10.3748/wjg.v26.i8.865,,,,608
941,Long-term and midterm outcomes of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative studies.,"This study aimed to compare midterm and long-term weight loss and resolution of co-morbidity with laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). LRYGB and LSG are the most common procedures performed in bariatric surgery. However, their weight loss efficacy in the midterm and long-term has not been well compared. A meta-analysis was performed by systematically identifying comparative studies conducted until the end of June 2016 that investigated weight loss outcome and resolution of co-morbidities (type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and obstructive sleep apnea) with LRYGB and LSG in the midterm (3-5 years) and long term (â‰¥5 years). The primary endpoint was weight loss after LRYGB versus LSG. The secondary endpoint was resolution of co-morbidities after these procedures. Fourteen studies comprising 5264 patients were eligible. Follow-up ranged from 36 months to 75.8Â±8.4 months. The pooled result for weight loss outcomes did not show any significant difference in midterm weight loss (standardized mean difference = -0.03; 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.38-.33; P = .88) but a significant difference in the long-term weight loss outcome favoring LRYGB (standardized mean difference = .17; 95% CI, .05-.28; P= .005). The pooled results demonstrated no significant difference for resolution of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Despite the insignificant difference between LRYGB and LSG in midterm weight loss, LRYGB produced better weight loss in the long-term. There was no significant difference between the 2 procedures for co-morbidity resolution.",10.1016/j.soard.2016.08.011,,,,609
56,Sex- and operation-dependent effects on 5-year weight loss results of bariatric surgery.,"Weight loss response after bariatric surgery is highly variable, and several demographic factors are associated with differential responses to surgery. Preclinical studies demonstrate numerous sex-specific responses to bariatric surgery, but whether these responses are also operation dependent is unknown. To examine sex-specific weight loss outcomes up to 5 years after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Single center, university, United States. Retrospective, observational cohort study including RYGB (n = 5057) and vertical SG (n = 2041) patients from a single, academic health center. Percentage total weight loss (TWL) over time was examined with generalized linear mixed models to determine the main and interaction effects of surgery type on weight loss by sex. TWL demonstrated a strong sex-by-procedure interaction, with women having a significant advantage with RYGB compared with SG (adjusted difference at 5 yr: 8.0% [95% CI: 7.5-8.5]; P < .001). Men also experienced greater TWL over time with RYGB or SG, but the difference was less and clinically insignificant (adjusted difference at 5 yr: 2.9% [2.0-3.8]; PÂ < .001; P interaction between sex and procedure type = .0001). Overall, women had greater TWL than men, and RYGB patients had greater TWL than SG patients (adjusted difference at 5 yr: 3.1% [2.4-3.2] and 6.9% [6.5-7.3], respectively; both P < .0001). Patients with diabetes lost less weight compared with those without (adjusted difference at 5 yr: 3.0% [2.7-3.2]; P < .0001). Weight loss after bariatric surgery is sex- and procedure-dependent. There is an association suggesting a clinically insignificant difference in weight loss between RYGB and SG among male patients at both the 2- and 5-year postsurgery time points.",10.1016/j.soard.2024.01.013,,,,610
990,"Rate of Death and Complications in Laparoscopic and Open Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass. A Meta-analysis and Meta-regression Analysis on 69,494 Patients.","Morbid obesity is a life threatening condition. Currently, surgery represents the only effective and durable therapeutic option to treat it. The first aim of the study was to estimate and compare the major surgical complications and the 30-day rate of mortality between laparoscopic and open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB and RYGB). The second aim was to evaluate the change in outcomes, complications, and deaths, with increased experience over the time period of the review. A random effect of the meta-analysis and meta-regression was used to evaluate surgical complications (i.e., reoperation, stenosis, bleeding, surgical site infection, fistula, internal hernia, and incisional ventral hernia) and the rate of mortality after LRYGB and RYGB over time. A search of literature from 2000 to 2014 led to the selection of 17 papers. When looking at surgical techniques separately, we observed a higher rate of mortality for open surgery (death rate 0.82Â %, 95Â % CIâ€‰=â€‰0.49-1.23) compared to laparoscopic surgery (death rate 0.22Â %, 95Â % CIâ€‰=â€‰0.09-0.40). This difference resulted highly significant when the two techniques were formally compared (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The improving of surgery technique resulted in a mean rate of mortality reduction of 0.069Â %. Laparoscopy represents the approach of choice for bariatric surgery. Contemporary reports of LRYGB show low mortality rates and progressive decline in postoperative complications. Laparoscopic bariatric surgery requires advanced laparoscopic skills, and probably an extended learning curve is not accounted for by current mortality statistics.",10.1007/s11695-016-2231-z,,,,611
61,Smoking Is Correlated to Internal Hernia After Gastric Bypass Surgery: a Post hoc Analysis of Data from a Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Internal herniation is a well-known complication of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (L-RYGB). The aim of this study was to evaluate smoking as an independent risk factor for internal herniation after L-RYGB. This study was performed as an exploratory post hoc analysis of data from a previous published randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to compare closure and non-closure of mesenteric defects in patients undergoing L-RYGB. The primary outcome of this study was to assess the significance of smoking as a risk factor for internal herniation after L-RYGB. Secondary outcome was early postoperative complications defined as Clavien-Dindo grade â‰¥ 2. Four hundred one patients were available for post hoc analysis. The risk of internal herniation was significantly higher among patients who were smoking preoperatively (hazard ratio (HR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (c.i.) 1.3 to 4.5; p = 0.005). This result persisted after adjusting for other patient characteristics (HR 2.2, 1.2 to 4.2; p = 0.016). 6.0% of the patients had postoperative complications within the first 30 days. 4.9% of these patients were smoking and 6.3% were not smoking, p = 0.657. 11.0% of the patients underwent surgery due to internal herniation by 5 years after the primary procedure. Smoking is a significant risk factor for internal herniation but did not increase risk for 30 days postoperative complications.",10.1007/s11695-024-07097-5,,,,612
1177,ERCP with the overtube-assisted enteroscopy technique: a systematic review.,"Overtube-assisted enteroscopy (OAE) techniques have increased the ability to perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in patients with altered upper gastrointestinal anatomy, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of OAE-ERCP in patients with different configurations of upper gastrointestinal anatomy. A systematic review was performed following a literature search for papers published between 1966 and August 2013. The following databases were searched: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Cochrane library, and Scopus. The following end points were analyzed: diagnostic and therapeutic success rates, cannulation success rate, ERCP success rate, type of enteroscopy, types of intervention, complications. A total of 23 relevant reports on OAE procedures, including single-balloon, double-balloon, and spiral enteroscopy, were analyzed. Studies included a total of 945 procedures in 679 patients (age 2â€Š-â€Š91 years) who had a variety of postsurgical upper gastrointestinal anatomical configurations. Among patients who underwent Roux-en-Y with gastric bypass, endoscopic success was 80â€Š% and ERCP success was 70â€Š%. In patients who had undergone a Roux-en-Y with either a pancreaticoduodenectomy, pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy, or hepaticojejunostomy, endoscopic success was 85â€Š% and ERCP success was 76â€Š%. In patients who had undergone a Billroth II procedure, endoscopic success was 96â€Š% and ERCP success was 90â€Š%. In patients with native papilla who underwent successful endoscopy, cannulation was successful in 90â€Š% of patients compared with 92â€Š% in patients with an anastomosis. Overall ERCP success for all attempts was approximately 74â€Š%. Interventions included sphincterotomy, pre-cut papillotomy, anastomotic stricturoplasty, stone removal, stent insertion, stent replacement, and balloon dilation of stenotic anastomosis. There were 32 major complications among the 945 procedures (3.4â€Š%). Both endoscopic and ERCP success rates were highest in patients with Billroth II anatomy, followed by those with pancreaticoduodenectomy and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy; the lowest success rates were in patients with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Cannulation rates appeared to be equivalent in patients with both native papilla and biliary-enteric or pancreaticoenteric anastomoses. The diagnostic and therapeutic potential of balloon-assisted ERCP were high and the adverse event rate was low.",10.1055/s-0034-1365698,,,,613
1473,"Finding the optimal dose of vitamin D following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a prospective, randomized pilot clinical trial.","Vitamin D deficiency is common following bariatric surgery and is due to a combination of baseline deficiency and postoperative malabsorption. There are few prospective studies evaluating the appropriate dose of vitamin D to prevent and treat vitamin D deficiency following bariatric surgery. We evaluated three doses of vitamin D3 (800, 2,000, and 5,000 IU/day) in a prospective, randomized pilot trial of 45 patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Serum 25 hydroxy Vitamin D (25OHD), intact PTH (iPTH), calcium, and urine calcium/creatinine ratios were measured at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Due to a high dropout rate at 24 months, we focus on the 12-month data. At 12 months, the 800-, 2,000-, and 5,000-IU groups had a mean +/- SD increase in 25OHD of 27.5 +/- 40.0, 60.2 +/- 37.4, and 66.1 +/- 42.2 nmol/L, respectively (p = 0.09) with a maximum increase in each group of 87.4, 114.8, and 129.8 nmol/L. Forty-four percent, 78%, and 70% achieved 25OHD levels >or=75 nmol/L (p = 0.38). Results for the 6- and 24-month time points were similar to the 12-month results. Mean weight loss at 24 months of the study was not different among groups (p = 0.52). Serum calcium did not change significantly, and there were no cases of hypercalcemia or sustained hypercalciuria. Higher doses of vitamin D supplementation trend towards higher levels of 25OHD. Vitamin D replacement as high as 5,000 IU /day is safe and necessary in many patients to treat vitamin D deficiency following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass yet is still suboptimal in others.",10.1007/s11695-008-9680-y,,,,614
1039,Robotic vs. Laparoscopic Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"We aim to summarize the available literature on patients treated with robotic RYGB and compare the clinical outcomes of patients treated with robotic RYGB with those treated with the standard laparoscopic RYGB. A systematic literature search of PubMed and Scopus databases was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Fourteen comparative and 11 non-comparative studies were included in this study, reporting data on 5145 patients. This study points to comparable clinical outcomes between robotic and laparoscopic RYGB. Robotic-assisted RYGB was associated with significantly less frequent anastomotic stricture events, reoperations, and a decreased length of hospital stay compared with the standard laparoscopic procedures; however, these findings should be interpreted with caution given the low number and poor quality of the studies currently available in the literature.",10.1007/s11695-015-1870-9,,,,615
1600,Clinical and cost effectiveness of surgery for morbid obesity: a systematic review and economic evaluation.,"To assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of surgery for people with morbid obesity. A systematic review of randomised control trials (RCTs), prospective clinical trials and economic evaluations identified from 14 electronic databases (including Medline, Cochrane library and Embase from their inception to October 2001), bibliographies and consultation with experts and manufacturers was performed to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of different surgical procedures and nonsurgical management for morbid obesity. An economic evaluation was undertaken to assess cost effectiveness in the UK. People diagnosed as morbidly obese, defined as a body mass index (BMI) (weight in kilograms/height in metres(2)) >40 kg/m(2), or with a BMI>35 kg/m(2) with serious comorbid disease, in whom previous nonsurgical interventions had failed. The outcomes assessed included weight change, quality of life, peri- and postoperative morbidity and mortality, revision rates and obesity comorbidities. Cost effectiveness was modelled from these data and presented as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Included studies differed in methodological quality. Surgery resulted in a significantly greater loss of weight (23-37 kg more weight) than nonsurgical treatment, which was maintained to 8 years and led to improvements in quality of life and comorbidities. The economic evaluation of surgery compared with nonsurgical management suggested that surgery was cost effective at pound 11000 per QALY. Comparisons of the different types of surgery were equivocal. Surgery for morbid obesity appears to be clinically and cost effective. Because of the nature of the evidence, particularly the uncertainty in the clinical and economic evaluations, it is difficult to distinguish between the different surgical procedures.",10.1038/sj.ijo.0802394,,,,616
943,Early reduction of resting energy expenditure and successful weight loss after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Weight loss and body composition changes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) may influence resting energy expenditure (REE). The effect of lower REE after the procedure on long-term weight remains to be elucidated. To evaluate the effects of RYGB on REE and body composition 6 months after RYGB and to find out whether postsurgery REE affects weight at 12 and 18 months SETTING: Tertiary referral hospital, southern Brazil METHOD: A prospective study involving 30 RYGB patients aged>18 years was performed. Body composition was evaluated by X-ray absorptiometry and REE by indirect calorimetry. All patients were assessed before RYGB and 6 months postoperatively. Further analysis of weight was carried out at 12 and 18 months. Baseline body mass index was 49Â±9 kg/mÂ² and mean weight was 128Â±19 kg, half of which comprised fat mass (50Â±5%). Baseline mean REE was 2297Â±182 kcal/d. The percent total weight loss was 26Â±7%, 32Â±9%, and 34Â±9% at 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively. The percent excess weight loss gradually increased from 54 Â± 12% at 6 months, to 67 Â± 18% at 12 months, and 71 Â± 19% at 18 months. REE was significantly lower at follow-up (-405Â±108 kcal/d; P<.001). Furthermore, an inverse correlation between REE at 6 months and percent excess weight loss at 18 months (r =-.612; P = .035) was observed in the subgroup of patients whose REE decreased>405 kcal/d at 6 months. Patients undergoing RYGB who had a substantial drop in REE at 6 months may exhibit less long-term weight loss.",10.1016/j.soard.2016.08.027,,,,617
1267,Prophylactic preperitoneal mesh placement in open bariatric surgery: a guard against incisional hernia development.,"Incisional hernia is one of the most common late complications of open bariatric surgery. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of preperitoneal prosthetic enforcement of midline incisions during open bariatric surgery in preventing incisional hernia development. This study randomized 64 morbidly obese patients admitted to undergo open bariatric surgery into two equal groups (I and II). A prophylactic sheet of polypropylene mesh was fixed in the preperitoneal space during wound closure in group I while in group II the wound was closed conventionally. This study included 51 females and 13 males ranged in age from 19 to 60 years. No significant difference was observed in mean age, mean preoperative body weight, mean body mass index, mean hospital stay, and mean follow-up period of either group. Three open procedures were done: vertical banded gastroplasty, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and vertical sleeve gastrectomy. No significant difference in mean operative time in either group for each operation was noted. Early postoperative wound complications were similar in either group. Incisional hernia incidence was significantly higher in group II, nine cases (28.1%), than in group I, one case (3.1%). Using prophylactic preperitoneal Prolene mesh during wound closure in open bariatric surgery is safe and effective in preventing incisional hernia development.",10.1007/s11695-013-0915-1,,,,618
1298,Gastrointestinal function and eating behavior after gastric bypass and duodenal switch.,"Duodenal switch provides greater weight loss than gastric bypass in severely obese patients; however, comparative data on the changes in gastrointestinal symptoms, bowel function, eating behavior, dietary intake, and psychosocial functioning are limited. The setting for the present study was 2 university hospitals in Norway and Sweden. Participants with a body mass index of 50-60 kg/m(2) were randomly assigned to gastric bypass (n = 31) or duodenal switch (n = 29) and followed up for 2 years. Of the 60 patients, 97% completed the study. Their mean weight decreased by 31.2% after gastric bypass and 44.8% after duodenal switch. At inclusion and 1 and 2 years of follow-up, the participants completed the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, a bowel function questionnaire, the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire-R21, a 4-day food record, and the Obesity-related Problems scale. Compared with the gastric bypass group, the duodenal switch group reported more symptoms of diarrhea (P = .0002), a greater mean number of daytime defecations (P = .007), and more anal leakage of stool (50% versus 18% of participants, respectively; P = .015) after 2 years. The scores for uncontrolled and emotional eating were significantly and similarly reduced after both operations. The mean total caloric intake and intake of fat and carbohydrates were significantly reduced in both groups. Protein intake was significantly reduced only after gastric bypass (P = .008, between-group comparison). Psychosocial function was significantly improved after both operations (P = .23, between the 2 groups). Gastrointestinal side effects and anal leakage of stool were more pronounced after duodenal switch than after gastric bypass. Both procedures led to reduced uncontrolled and emotional eating, reduced caloric intake, and improved psychosocial functioning.",10.1016/j.soard.2012.06.006,,,,619
1122,Is laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy a lower risk bariatric procedure compared with laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass? A meta-analysis.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is the current ""gold standard"" bariatric procedure in the United States. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has recently become a commonly performed procedure for many reasons, including patients' perception that LSG has less complexity and invasiveness, and lower risk. Our objective was to review the literature and compare the leak rates, morbidity, and mortality for LRYGB versus LSG. Publications from 2002 to 2012 with n greater than or equal to 25 and postoperative leak rate reported were included. Statistical analysis included chi-square according to patient number. Twenty-eight (10,906 patients) LRYGB and 33 (4,816 patients) LSG articles were evaluated. Leak rates after LRYGB versus LSG were 1.9% (n = 206) versus 2.3% (n = 110), respectively (P = .077). Mortality rates were .4% (27/7,117) for LRYGB and .2% (7/3,594) for LSG (PÂ =Â .110). Timing from surgery to leak ranged from 1 to 12Â days for LRYGB versus 1 to 35Â days for LSG. Leak and mortality rates after LRYGB and LSG were comparable. The appropriate procedure should be tailored based on patient factors, comorbidities, patient and surgeon comfort level, surgeon experience, and institutional outcomes.",10.1016/j.amjsurg.2014.08.002,,,,620
719,Food Intolerance 1Â Year After Banded Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass.,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the food intolerance after banded Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), correlating the data of food ingestion. METHODS: This is an observational prospective study, which evaluated the individuals before and 3, 6, and 12Â months after banded RYGB. We performed an anthropometric evaluation and an assessment of the habitual food ingestion and applied a food tolerance questionnaire. RESULTS: The study group was comprised of 75 individuals, 89% of them female, with a percentual weight loss of 29.73â€‰Â±â€‰6.79%. The observed results were that food intolerance increased over time and 1Â year after surgery, only 2.7% reported to ingest any type of food, while the greatest difficulty was related to red meat (80%). Regarding vomits, after surgery, this proportion significantly increased after 3, 6, and 12Â months. Preoperatively, the mean protein ingestion was 98Â g, which decreased to 50Â g after 3 and 6Â months and to 51Â g after 12Â months. As a conclusion, food intolerance significantly increased following banded RYGB, leading to a crescent dissatisfaction regarding food and an increase in the vomits frequency.",10.1007/s11695-018-3544-x,,,,621
187,"Changes in Plasma Metabolomic Profile Following Bariatric Surgery, Lifestyle Intervention or Diet Restriction-Insights from Human and Rat Studies.","Although bariatric surgery is known to change the metabolome, it is unclear if this is specific for the intervention or a consequence of the induced bodyweight loss. As the weight loss after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) can hardly be mimicked with an evenly effective diet in humans, translational research efforts might be helpful. A group of 188 plasma metabolites of 46 patients from the randomized controlled WÃ¼rzburg Adipositas Study (WAS) and from RYGB-treated rats (n = 6) as well as body-weight-matched controls (n = 7) were measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. WAS participants were randomized into intensive lifestyle modification (LS, n = 24) or RYGB (OP, n = 22). In patients in the WAS cohort, only bariatric surgery achieved a sustained weight loss (BMI -34.3% (OP) vs. -1.2% (LS), p â‰¤ 0.01). An explicit shift in the metabolomic profile was found in 57 metabolites in the human cohort and in 62 metabolites in the rodent model. Significantly higher levels of sphingolipids and lecithins were detected in both surgical groups but not in the conservatively treated human and animal groups. RYGB leads to a characteristic metabolomic profile, which differs distinctly from that following non-surgical intervention. Analysis of the human and rat data revealed that RYGB induces specific changes in the metabolome independent of weight loss.",10.3390/ijms24032354,,,,622
1249,Perioperative outcomes after totally robotic gastric bypass: a prospective nonrandomized controlled study.,"Perioperative short-term outcomes could be improved after totally robotic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (TR-RYGBP) compared with conventional laparoscopic gastric bypass. This is a nonrandomized controlled prospective study (N = 200) to evaluate perioperative short-term outcomes. The primary endpoint was to investigate risk factors for 30-day surgical complications. Mean total operative time was shorter in patients who underwent TR-RYGBP (130 vs 147 minutes; P < .0001). However, postoperative surgical complications rate (13% vs 1%; P = .001), and mean overall hospital stay (9.3 vs 6.7 days; P < .0001) were higher after TR-RYGBP. By multivariate analysis, robotic surgery (hazard ratio [HR] = 15.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8 to 280; P = .01), and conversion to laparotomy (HR = 18.8; 95% CI, 1.7 to 250.8; P = .014) were independent risk factors for 30-day surgical complications. Although robotic gastric bypass reduces mean operative time, TR-RYGBP is associated with an increased postoperative surgical complications rate and longer hospitalization.",10.1016/j.amjsurg.2012.07.049,,,,623
104,Surgical approaches for achalasia and obesity: a systematic review and patient-level meta-analysis.,"Synchronous and metachronous presentations of achalasia and obesity are increasingly common. There is limited data to guide the combined or staged surgical approaches to these conditions. A systematic review (MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science) and patient-level meta-analysis of published cases were performed to examine the most effective surgical approach for patients with synchronous or metachronous presentations of achalasia and obesity. Thirty-three studies with 93 patients were reviewed. Eighteen patients underwent concurrent achalasia and bariatric surgery, with the most common (nâ€‰=â€‰12, 72.2%) being laparoscopic Heller's myotomy (LHM) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). This combination achieved 68.9% excess weight loss and 100% remission of achalasia (mean follow-up: 3Â years). Seven (6 RYGB, 1 biliopancreatic diversion) patients had bariatric surgery following achalasia surgery. Of these, all 6 RYGBs had satisfactory bariatric outcomes, with complete remission of their achalasia (mean follow-up: 1.8Â years). Sixty-eight patients underwent myotomy following bariatric surgery; the majority (nâ€‰=â€‰55, 80.9%) were following RYGB. In this scenario, per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) achieved higher treatment success than LHM (nâ€‰=â€‰33 of 35, 94.3% vs. nâ€‰=â€‰14 of 20, 70.0%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.021). Moreover, conversion to RYGB following a restrictive bariatric procedure during achalasia surgery was also associated with higher achalasia treatment success. In patients with concurrent achalasia and obesity, LHM and RYGB achieved good outcomes for both pathologies. For those with weight gain post-achalasia surgery, RYGB provided satisfactory weight loss, without adversely affecting achalasia symptoms. For those with achalasia after bariatric surgery, POEM and conversion to RYGB produced greater treatment success.",10.1007/s00423-023-03143-5,,,,624

263,Late (â‰¥5â€‰y) Complications of Laparoscopic Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (LVSG) and Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB): A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"There is a paucity of data that compares the relative complication profiles of laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy (LVSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) at 5 years. The aim was to compare late complications of LVSG and LRYGB. We updated our previous systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of primary LVSG and LRYGB procedures in adults, to review late (5 years) complication outcomes (PROSPERO 112054). Electronic databases were searched from January 2015 to July 2021 for publications meeting inclusion criteria. The Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman random effects model was utilized to estimate weighted mean differences where meta-analysis was possible. Bias and certainty of evidence was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations. Four randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria (n=531; LVSG=272, LRYGB=259). No late treatment-related mortality was reported with either procedure. A significant reduction in surgical reoperations (odds ratio: 0.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.27-0.82, P =0.01) and endoscopic interventions (odds ratio: 0.29, 95% confidence interval: 0.12-0.71, P =0.02) were reported at 5 years post-LVSG relative to LRYGB. Reoperations were more frequently performed for reflux management in LVSG and for internal hernia repairs in LRYGB. Complications requiring medical management were common following both procedures. Limitations included few eligible studies for inclusion, and varying definitions of medically managed complications. LRYGB is associated with a higher proportion of surgical and endoscopic interventions at 5 years compared with LVSG. More high-quality, long-term studies are required to further elucidate both surgical and nutritional long-term outcomes post these procedures.",10.1097/SLE.0000000000001065,,,,626
1238,Bile acids and gut peptide secretion after bariatric surgery: a 1-year prospective randomized pilot trial.,"Increased delivery of bile acid salts (BA) to distal L-cells and altered TGR5 receptor activation may contribute to the early and substantial increases in gut peptide secretion seen after bariatric surgery. To further elucidate a potential role of BA in the secretion of GLP-1 and PYY, we analyzed plasma BA concentrations in 14 morbidly obese patients undergoing gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy in a prospective, randomized 1-year trial. Patients received a standard test meal and blood was collected before and after eating, prior to, and 1 week, 3 months, and 12 months after surgery. Pre-surgery, basal BA concentrations were significantly lower in bariatric patients than in healthy controls. One year post-surgery, bariatric patients expressed variably increased BA concentrations (gastric bypass patients âˆ¼2 fold increase, Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.05). However, whereas in both patient groups, marked increases in GLP-1 and PYY and improved glycemic control was seen already 1 week and 3 months post-surgery, changes in plasma BA followed a different pattern: basal and postprandial plasma BA concentrations increased much slower, more progressively with significant increases only 1-year post-surgery. Based on these findings, BA do not appear to be key mediators of the early increase in GLP-1 and PYY response in post-bariatric patients.",10.1002/oby.20522,,,,627
895,"Effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on insulin secretion and sensitivity, glucose homeostasis, and diabetic control: A prospective cohort study in Chinese patients.","To report on the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass operation for obesity on measures of adiposity, insulin secretion and sensitivity, glucose homeostasis, and improvement in diabetic control in Chinese patients. This was a prospective cohort study of 152 participants (81% with diabetes) who were recruited for bariatric operation. Mean body mass index was decreased by 18.1% from 30.31Â Â±Â 5.38Â kg/m2 at baseline to 24.45Â Â±Â 3.79Â kg/m2 at 2Â years (PÂ <Â .001). Indices of insulin secretion, including serum c-peptide (both fasted and at various time points during an oral glucose tolerance test) improved at the 3-year follow-up, with a significant improvement in insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. The effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 3Â years postoperative on adiposity were paralleled by a significant improvement in insulin secretion and sensitivity, and glucose tolerance.",10.1016/j.surg.2016.11.027,,,,628
519,Reoperation Incidence and Severity Within 6Â Months After Bariatric Surgery: a Propensity-Matched Study from Nationwide Data.,"Data about incidence and severity of reoperations up to 6Â months after bariatric surgery are currently limited. The aim of this cohort study was to evaluate the incidence and severity of reoperations after initial bariatric surgical procedures and to compare this between the 3 most frequent current surgical procedures (sleeve, gastric bypass, gastric banding). Nationwide observational cohort study using data from French Hospital Information System (2013-2015) to evaluate incidence and severity of reoperations within 6Â months after bariatric surgery. Hazard ratios (HR) of longitudinal comparison between historical propensity-matched cohorts were estimated from a Fine and Gray's model using competing risk of death. Cumulative reoperation rates increased from postoperative day-30 to day-180. Consequently, 31.1 to 90.0% of procedures would have been missed if the reoperation rate was based solely on a 30-day follow-up. Reoperation rate at 6Â months was significantly higher after gastric bypass than after sleeve (HR 0.64; IC 95% [0.53-0.77]) and corresponded to moderate-risk reoperations (HR 0.65; IC 95% [0.53-0.78]). Reoperation rate at 6Â months was significantly higher after gastric banding than after sleeve (HR 0.08; IC 95% [0.07-0.09]) and corresponded to moderate-risk reoperations (HR 0.08; IC 95% [0.07-0.10]). Cumulative incidence of reoperations increased from 30Â days to 6Â months after sleeve, gastric bypass, or gastric banding and corresponded to moderate-risk surgical procedures. Consequently, 30-day reoperation rate should no longer be considered when evaluating complications and surgical performance after bariatric surgery.",10.1007/s11695-020-04570-9,,,,629
1038,Effect of Duodenal-Jejunal Bypass Surgery on Glycemic Control in Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"To determine whether upper gastrointestinal tract (UGI) bypass itself has beneficial effects on the factors involved in regulating glucose homeostasis in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). A 12-month randomized controlled trial was conducted in 17 overweight/obese subjects with T2D, who received standard medical care (SC, n = 7, BMI = 31.7 Â± 3.5 kg/m(2) ) or duodenal-jejunal bypass surgery with minimal gastric resection (DJBm) (n = 10; BMI = 29.7 Â± 1.9 kg/m(2)). A 5-h modified oral glucose tolerance test was performed at baseline and at 1, 6, and 12 months after surgery or starting SC. Body weight decreased progressively after DJBm (7.9 Â± 4.1%, 9.6 Â± 4.2%, and 10.2 Â± 4.3% at 1, 6, and 12 months, respectively) but remained stable in the SC group (P < 0.001). DJBm, but not SC, improved: (1) oral glucose tolerance (decreased 2-h glucose concentration, P = 0.039), (2) insulin sensitivity (decreased homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, P = 0.013), (3) early insulin response to a glucose load (increased insulinogenic index, P = 0.022), and (4) overall glycemic control (reduction in HbA1c with fewer diabetes medications). DJBm causes moderate weight loss and improves metabolic function in T2D. However, our study cannot separate the benefits of moderate weight loss from the potential therapeutic effect of UGI tract bypass itself on the observed metabolic improvements.",10.1002/oby.21190,,,,630
912,"Evaluation of the biochemical, inflammatory and oxidative profile of obese patients given clinical treatment and bariatric surgery.","We investigated the biochemical and inflammatory parameters as well as biomarkers of oxidative stress in morbidly obese patients before and after bariatric surgery and clinical treatment. This study was conducted using 60 individuals (10 men and 50 women) distributed into 3 groups: the control group, 20 non-diabetic obese patients given clinical treatment, the bariatric group, 20 non-diabetic obese patients given a Roux-en-Y bypass gastroplasty, and the bariatric diabetic group, 20 diabetic obese patients given a Roux-en-Y bypass gastroplasty. Measurements were made before and 1, 3, 6, and 12months after surgery and clinical treatment. We showed a significant decrease in body weight, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference, accompanied by a decrease in the lipid profile and glucose and glycated hemoglobin concentrations in the groups that received bariatric surgery. The concentrations of lipid peroxidation, carbonyl protein and NPSH, as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, significantly decreased in both groups after surgery. The concentrations of inteleukin-6, inteleukin-1, TNF-Î± and resistin were also significantly lower, while adiponectin concentrations significantly increased 12months after bariatric surgery. No significant alterations were observed in the biochemical, inflammatory or oxidative parameters of the control group. Our findings demonstrate a decrease in body mass and a subsequent improvement in biochemical, metabolic and anthropometric parameters in patients given bariatric surgery. This may contribute to the reduction of oxidative damage in these patients and consequently a reduction in the risk of the development and progression of multiple co-morbidities associated with obesity.",10.1016/j.cca.2016.12.012,,,,631
117,Bariatric Surgery Before and After the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: a Comparative Study of Cases Before the Onset of the Pandemic in a High-Volume Academic Center.,"At the beginning of the pandemic, studies showed a higher risk of severe surgical complications and mortality among patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection, which led to the suspension of elective surgery. Confinement and lockdown measures were shown to be associated with weight gain and less access to medical and surgical care in patients with obesity, with negative health consequences. To evaluate the safety of bariatric surgery during the pandemic, we compared 30-day complications between patients who underwent bariatric surgery immediately before with those who underwent bariatric surgery during the opening phase of the pandemic. Observational analytical study of a non-concurrent cohort of patients who underwent bariatric surgery in 2 periods: pre-pandemic March 1 to December 31, 2019, and pandemic March 1 to December 31, 2020. Surgical complications were defined using the Clavien-Dindo classification. Pre-pandemic and pandemic groups included 256 and 202 patients who underwent primary bariatric surgery, respectively. The mean age was 37.6 + 10.3 years. The overall complication rate during the first 30 days of discharge was 7.42%. No differences between groups were observed in severe complications (pre-pandemic 1.56% vs. pandemic 1.98%, p: 0.58). No mortality was reported. Overall 30-day readmission was 3.28% with no differences between groups. The findings of this study did not find a difference in the rate of severe complications, nor also we report severe COVID-19 complications in this high-risk population. During the pandemic, with appropriately implemented protocol, the resumption of bariatric surgery is possible with no increased risk for patients.",10.1007/s11695-023-06677-1,,,,632
19,Sex-differential testosterone response to long-term weight loss.,"Obesity-associated gonadal dysfunction is a common comorbidity in patients seeking weight loss interventions. We examined the incremental effect of weight loss on gonadal axes in men and women over 3 years. Changes in sex hormones were compared between dietary intervention (Diet) and bariatric procedures: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). Additional analysis assessed changes in corticotropic, somatotropic and thyroid axes after weight loss interventions. This prospective, observational study included 61 adults with Body Mass Index >30â€‰kg/m2, mean age 51 (SDâ€‰=â€‰11) years. Endocrine parameters were measured at baseline and at 6 timepoints over 36-months. For each 1â€‰kg of weight lost, between baseline and 36 months, total testosterone increased by 0.6% (95% CI: 0.2%, 1.0%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.002) in males and decreased by 0.8% (95% CI: -1.4%, -0.3%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.003) in females. These changes remained statistically significant when controlled for age and for menopausal status in females. At 36 months, in comparison with Diet, RYGB women had lower total testosterone by 54% (95% CI: -90%, -17%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.004), reduced free androgen index (FAI) by 65% (95% CI; -114%, -17%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.009) while SG had reduced FAI by 39% (95% CI; -77%, 0%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.05). No such differences between groups were noted for male subjects. Adrenocorticotropic hormone declined by 0.3% (95% CI: 0.0, -0.5%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.05), insulin-like growth factor-1 increased by 0.4% (95% CI; 0.2%, 0.7%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.005), without such thyrotrophin change for each 1â€‰kg of weight loss, for entire cohort, over 36 months. The testosterone changes observed in this study were proportional to the amount of weight loss. In females, reduction in androgens was independent of age and menopausal status and more pronounced after bariatric procedures. This study finding warrants further clinical research to explore an impact of androgen reduction on functional and cognitive status in postmenopausal women. The observed changes in pituitary hormones may contribute to the metabolic benefits of bariatric surgery.",10.1038/s41366-024-01591-7,,,,633
957,Time to Glycemic Control - an Observational Study of 3 Different Operations.,"Medical treatment fails to provide adequate control for many obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A comparative observational study of bariatric procedures was performed to investigate the time at which patients achieve glycemic control within the first 30 postoperative days following sleeve gastrectomy (SG), mini-gastric bypass (MGB), and diverted sleeve gastrectomy with ileal transposition (DSIT). Included patients had a body mass index (BMI) â‰¥30Â kg/m2; T2DM for â‰¥3Â years, HbA1CÂ >Â 7Â % for â‰¥3Â months, and no significant weight change (>3Â %) within the prior 3Â months. Surgical procedures performed were SG (nÂ =Â 49), MGB (nÂ =Â 93), and DSIT (nÂ =Â 109). The primary endpoint was the day within the first postoperative month on which mean fasting capillary glucose levels reached <126Â mg/dL. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of glycemic control. The cohort included 251 patients with a mean BMI of 36.04Â Â±Â 5.76Â kg/m2; age, 52.84Â Â±Â 8.52Â years; T2DM duration, 13.09Â Â±Â 7.54Â years; HbA1C, 8.82Â Â±Â 1.58Â %. On the morning of surgery, mean fasting plasma glucose was 177.63Â Â±Â 51.3Â mg/dL; on day 30, 131.35Â Â±Â 28.7Â mg/dL (pÂ <Â 0.05). Mean fasting plasma glucose of <126Â mg/dL was reached in the DSIT group (124.36Â Â±Â 20.21Â mg/dL) on day 29, and in the MGB group (123.61Â Â±Â 22.51Â mg/dL), on day 30. The SG group did not achieve target mean capillary glucose level within postoperative 30Â days. During the first postoperative month, glycemic control (<126Â mg/dL) was achieved following DSIT and MGB, but not SG. Preoperative BMI and postprandial C-peptide levels were independent predictors of early glycemic control following DSIT.",10.1007/s11695-016-2344-4,,,,634
1658,Psychosocial and physical activity changes after gastric restrictive procedures for morbid obesity.,"Gastric restrictive procedures for morbid obesity are frequently performed to reduce problems arising from the physical limitations and social isolation of massive obesity. Numerous reports have described changes in weight after gastric restrictive operations, yet few studies have documented changes in the secondary effects of obesity. This report deals with changes in psychosocial status and physical activity occurring in 240 patients who remained in the study 3 years after surgery. These patients were members of a group of 310 patients who were entered into a prospective randomized trial to assess the relative benefits of three forms of gastric restrictive procedure. Prior to operation, and at yearly intervals after operation, the physical activities and psychosocial status of each patient was assessed by a standardized semi-structured interview. At the time of the three-year interview the median weight loss for these patients was 29.5 kg which represents 53% of excess weight lost. This weight loss was associated with a marked reduction in the amount of food eaten. There was a significant increase in the number of patients smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day and a mild increase in alcohol intake. There were significant improvements in the level of self-image and state of happiness. The social lives and sex lives of the majority of patients were improved and a significantly greater number of patients reported being in a stable emotional relationship at 3 years after operation than did so pre-operatively. There was a marked increase in the number of patients in full-time or part-time employment from 38% prior to surgery to 60% at 3 years after operation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",10.1111/j.1445-2197.1990.tb07469.x,,,,635
287,Effects of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Versus Sleeve Gastrectomy on Body Composition for Patients with a BMIâ€‰>â€‰35Â kg/m2 at 1 Year After Surgery.,"Effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) versus sleeve gastrectomy (SG) on body composition have not been well compared. This meta-analysis aimed to compare changes in fat mass (FM) and lean tissue mass (LTM) for patients with a BMIâ€‰>â€‰35Â kg/m2 at 1Â year after RYGB and SG. PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched ending in December 2021 for eligible studies which reported baseline and postsurgical BMI, FM, and LTM. Of 17 eligible studies, 831 patients were included, 484 following RYGB and 347 following SG. Weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were from a random-effects model. For patients with a BMIâ€‰>â€‰35Â kg/m2, RYGB resulted in a more substantial reduction of BMI (-â€‰14.13Â kg/m2 [95%CIâ€‰-â€‰14.74,â€‰-â€‰13.53] versusâ€‰-â€‰11.96Â kg/m2 [95%CIâ€‰-â€‰12.81,â€‰-â€‰11.11], Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and FM (-â€‰26.22Â kg [95%CIâ€‰-â€‰28.31,â€‰-â€‰24.12] versusâ€‰-â€‰21.50Â kg [95%CIâ€‰-â€‰25.52,â€‰-â€‰17.48], Pâ€‰=â€‰0.042) than SG, and a relatively weaker impact on LTM (-â€‰8.28Â kg [95%CIâ€‰-â€‰9.33,â€‰-â€‰7.22] versusâ€‰-â€‰10.12Â kg [95%CIâ€‰-â€‰11.55,â€‰-â€‰8.68], Pâ€‰=â€‰0.043). This meta-analysis study indicates that RYGB is superior to SG in reducing excess FM for patients with a BMIâ€‰>â€‰35Â kg/m2 and seems to be more beneficial when LTM preservation is taken into consideration.",10.1007/s11695-022-06006-y,,,,636
940,Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding: a Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial Comparing 5-Year Results of two Different Bands in 103 Patients.,"Various types of adjustable gastric bands are used during LAGB, but there is insufficient data comparing different bands in the long term. We carried out a prospective randomized study to compare two different bands. Between January 1, 2009 and January 31, 2010, 103 morbidly obese patients were randomized between SAGB and MiniMizer Extra adjustable gastric bands. The SAGB was used in 49 and MiniMizer Extra in 54 patients. Weight loss, comorbidities, long-term complications, and quality of life were evaluated after 5Â years. Patient baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. The mean patient age was 45.9Â Â±Â 11.7Â years, and mean preoperative BMI was 47.5Â Â±Â 7.3Â kg/m2. A total of 90 of 103 patients (87.3Â %) completed the 5-year follow-up. The mean excess weight loss was 44.1 and 50.3Â % in SAGB and MiniMizer groups, respectively (pÂ =Â 0.14). A proportion of patients who reached a BMIÂ <Â 35Â kg/m2 was significantly larger in MiniMizer Extra group (52.9 vs 25.5Â %; pÂ =Â 0.01). Complications developed in 15 patients (14.5Â %) and consisted of 5 band erosions, 4 port-related complications, 3 band slippages, and 3 band intolerances. All five band erosions developed in MiniMizer Extra group, but the difference was not significant (pÂ =Â 0.058). No difference was found regarding postoperative complications, resolution of comorbidities, and quality of life between compared groups. SAGB and MiniMizer Extra bands demonstrated similar long-term results regarding the weight loss, resolution of comorbidities, morbidity, and quality of life.",10.1007/s11695-016-2416-5,,,,637
55,Improvement in Pulmonary Hypertension Following Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery: a Brief Review and Meta-analysis.,"We reviewed the available evidence on the outcome of metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH). Five studies examining 174 patients were included; the mean age was 54.5â€‰Â±â€‰9.27Â years; the mean BMI before surgery and at the end of follow-up were 47.2â€‰Â±â€‰5.95Â kg/m2 and 37.4â€‰Â±â€‰2.51Â kg/m2, respectively. Furthermore, the results showed a significant decrease in the right ventricle systolic pressure (RVSP) after MBS with a mean difference of 10.11% (CI 95%: 3.52, 16.70, I2â€‰=â€‰85.37%, pâ€‰=â€‰â€‰<â€‰0.001), at 16.5Â  Â± Â 3.8Â month follow-up with a morbidity rate of 26% and 0 mortality. Thirty-day postoperative complications included respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary edema, and anastomotic leak. There appears to be a significant improvement in PH with a decrease in medication requirements after MBS.",10.1007/s11695-024-07162-z,,,,638
1328,Comparison of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) with other bariatric procedures; a systematic review of the randomised controlled trials.,"Bariatric surgery can provide efficient weight loss and improvement in obesity-related co-morbidities in adults. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) comprised 30.3% of all bariatric procedures between 2009 and 2010 in the UK. This review evaluates the level 1 evidence for change in co-morbidities, quality of life (QoL) and weight provided by LAGB compared with other bariatric procedures. Systematic literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL (1988 to May 2011) was performed. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Studies with non-surgical comparators, open gastric banding procedures or adolescent participants were excluded. Primary outcome was change in co-morbidities. Secondary outcomes included QoL, weight loss, complications, operation time and length of stay. Five RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Vertical banded gastroplasty, sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass were compared to LAGB. Co-morbidities were reported in two studies and QoL in one. LAGB was comparable to other procedures for both of these outcomes. All five trials showed LABG to be effective in weight loss, however all comparative procedures resulted in greater weight loss. Operative time and length of hospital stay were significantly shorter with LAGB. Short-term complications were found to be consistently lower in the LAGB group. Evidence was divided with respect to long-term complications. Co-morbidities and QoL are poorly reported and showed no difference between LAGB and other bariatric procedures. Evidence suggests that LAGB is not the most effective surgical procedure to reduce weight. LAGB is associated with lower early complications and shorter operative time and length of stay, and therefore may be preferable to patients.",10.1016/j.surge.2012.02.001,,,,639
946,The Impact of Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch (BPD/DS) Over 9Â Years.,"There is limited information on the multiple long-term effects of the biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD/DS). Patients who consented to a BPD/DS from 1999 to 2010 were evaluated for weight change, complications, comorbidity resolution, body composition, quality of life, and depressive symptoms during visits at 1, 3,5, 7, and 9Â years. Descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, and pair-wise comparisons were calculated for each of the five follow-up cohorts vs. the baseline cohort. Between 1999 and 2010, 284 patients received a BPD/DS; 275 patients (69.8Â % women) age 42.7Â years, BMI 53.4Â kg/m2 qualified for baseline analysis. Two hundred seventy-five patients were available in year 1; 275 patients in year 3; 273 patients in year 5; 259 patients in year 7; and 228 patients in year 9. Gender distribution was not different. BMI was 30.1 at 1Â year and 32.0 at 9Â years. Body fat was reduced to 26Â % after 2Â years. Complications requiring surgery were significant. Nutritional problems developed in 29.8Â % of patients over the course of observation. The baseline Beck Depression Index (BDI) was 13.9 and 7.2 in year 1. Year 1 through 9 remained unchanged. There were significant positive changes in quality of life between baseline and year 1 for most domains. These positive changes were maintained for the follow-up cohorts. After surgery the resolution of comorbidities continued for the 9Â years. Weight loss during the first year was well maintained, resolving comorbidities and improving quality of life. Rates of surgical complications resemble other bariatric procedures. Long-term nutrient deficiencies are of concern.",10.1007/s11695-016-2371-1,,,,640
356,"Technical Feasibility, Outcomes, and Patient SatisfactionÂ After Needlescopic and Laparoscopic Bariatric Surgery: a Randomized Study.","Needlescopic instruments create a 3-mm incision and may result in less pain and superior cosmesis. There is limited understanding of the effectiveness of needlescopic instruments in patients with a body mass index (BMI) > 35 kg/m2. We report perioperative outcomes and perception of body image with use of needlescopic instruments after bariatric surgery. Laparoscopic bariatric procedures were performed on 30 adults at a single academic medical center from January to December 2017. Patients were randomized to conventional laparoscopy (LAP) or needlescopic (NEED) surgery. The Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire (MBSRQ) and Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire (PSAQ) were completed at 6 months and 1 year. Univariate analysis was performed on perioperative outcomes and survey scores. Surgery was completed on patients in the LAP group (N = 13) and compared to the NEED group (N = 17). The mean BMI was 41.4 kg/m2 LAP and 41.1 kg/m2 NEED. The most common procedure was Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), with 13 RYGB in LAP and 12 RYGB in NEED (P = 0.76).The operative time was not significantly different between the LAP and the NEED group (209.5 Â± 66.1 vs 181.9 Â± 58.1 min, P = 0.48). There was no leak or mortality in the 30-day follow-up period. Within MBSRQ, the patient's appearance self-evaluation score was similar between LAP and NEED (2.5 Â± 0.6 vs 2.4 Â± 0.6, P = 0.61). Within PSAQ, the mean satisfaction score for incision appearance was also similar between LAP and NEED (16.1Â± 2.9 vs 15.4 Â± 4.6, P = 0.85). Incision-related perceptions remained consistent at 6 months and 1 year after bariatric surgery. Needlescopic instruments are safe and a viable alternative to use during bariatric surgery. Appearance and perception of scar were similar between groups. Further studies with needlescopic instruments should include patients with a BMI > 35 kg/m2 and compare additional factors associated with body image.",10.1007/s11695-021-05675-5,,,,641
1507,Effects of dexmedetomidine in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass.,"Obese patients may be sensitive to the respiratory depressant effect of opioid analgesics. Alternative methods for analgesia may be beneficial for management of bariatric surgery. We evaluated the effect of dexmedetomidine on anesthetic requirements during surgery, hemodynamic, recovery profile and morphine use in the postoperative period. Eighty adult patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery were randomly assigned to one of two study groups; Group D (40 patients) received dexmedetomidine (0.8-microg/kg bolus, 0,4 microg kg(-1) h) and Group P (40 patients) received normal saline (placebo) in the same volume and rate. Intraoperative and postoperative mean blood pressure and heart rate were recorded. The total amount of intraoperative fentanyl and propofol required to maintain anesthesia were measured. Recovery profile, pain score and total amount of morphine used via patient controlled analgesia (PCA) were assessed. During surgery, dexmedetomidine decreased the total amount of intraoperative fentanyl and propofol required for maintenance of anesthesia compared to placebo. Patients who received dexmedetomidine showed significant decrease of intraoperative and postoperative mean blood pressure, heart rate. In the postoperative period, dexmedetomidine decreased pain scores and PCA morphine use significantly and showed better recovery profile as compared to the placebo Group. There was no difference in the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) between both groups. The intraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine decreased the total amount of propofol and fentanyl required to maintain anesthesia, offered better control of intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamics, decreased postoperative pain level, decreased the total amount of morphine used and showed better recovery profile compared with placebo.",,,,,642
628,Changes in Gut Microbiome after Bariatric Surgery Versus Medical Weight Loss in a Pilot Randomized Trial.,"Gut microbiota likely impact obesity and metabolic diseases. We evaluated the changes in gut microbiota after surgical versus medical weight loss in adults with diabetes and obesity. We performed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to identify the gut microbial composition at baseline and at 10% weight loss in adults with diabetes who were randomized to medical weight loss (MWL, nâ€‰=â€‰4), adjustable gastric banding (AGB, nâ€‰=â€‰4), or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB, nâ€‰=â€‰4). All participants were female, 75% reported black race with mean age of 51Â years. At similar weight loss amount and glycemic improvement, the RYGB group had the most number of bacterial species (10 increased, 1 decreased) that significantly changed (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) in relative abundance. Alpha-diversity at follow-up was significantly lower in AGB group compared to MWL and RYGB (observed species for AGB vs. MWL, pâ€‰=â€‰0.0093; AGB vs. RYGB, pâ€‰=â€‰0.0093). The relative abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii increased in 3 participants after RYGB, 1 after AGB, and 1 after MWL. At similar weight loss and glycemic improvement, the greatest alteration in gut microbiota occurred after RYGB with an increase in the potentially beneficial bacterium, F. prausnitzii. Gut microbial diversity tended to decrease after AGB and increase after RYGB and MWL. Future studies are needed to determine the impact and durability of gut microbial changes over time and their role in long-term metabolic improvement after bariatric surgery in adults with type 2 diabetes.

1367,"Early improvement in glycemic control after bariatric surgery and its relationships with insulin, GLP-1, and glucagon secretion in type 2 diabetic patients.","The surgical treatment of obesity ameliorates metabolic abnormalities in patients with type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the early effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on metabolic and hormonal parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Ten patients with T2DM (BMI, 39.7 Â± 1.9) were evaluated before and 7, 30, and 90 days after RYGB. A meal test was performed, and plasma insulin, glucose, glucagon, and glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1) levels were measured at fasting and postprandially. Seven days after RYGB, a significant reduction was observed in HOMA-IR index from 7.8 Â± 5.5 to 2.6 Â± 1.7; p < 0.05 was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in body weight. The insulin and GLP-1 curves began to show a peak at 30 min after food ingestion, while there was a progressive decrease in glucagon and blood glucose levels throughout the meal test. Thirty and 90 days after RYGB, along with progressive weight loss, blood glucose and hormonal changes remained in the same direction and became more expressive with the post-meal insulin curve suggesting recovery of the first phase of insulin secretion and with the increase in insulinogenic index, denoting improvement in Î²-cell function. Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between changes in GLP-1 and insulin levels measured at 30 min after meal (r = 0.6; p = 0.000). Our data suggest that the RYGB surgery, beyond weight loss, induces early beneficial hormonal changes which favor glycemic control in type 2 diabetes.",10.1007/s11695-011-0412-3,,,,644

1402,Beta cell function after weight loss: a clinical trial comparing gastric bypass surgery and intensive lifestyle intervention.,"The effects of various weight loss strategies on pancreatic beta cell function remain unclear. We aimed to compare the effect of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) on beta cell function. One year controlled clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00273104). One hundred and nineteen morbidly obese participants without known diabetes from the MOBIL study (mean (s.d.) age 43.6 (10.8) years, body mass index (BMI) 45.5 (5.6) kg/mÂ², 84 women) were allocated to RYGB (n = 64) or ILI (n = 55). The patients underwent repeated oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) and were categorised as having either normal (NGT) or abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT). Twenty-nine normal-weight subjects with NGT (age 42.6 (8.7) years, BMI 22.6 (1.5) kg/mÂ², 19 women) served as controls. OGTT-based indices of beta cell function were calculated. One year weight reduction was 30% (8) after RYGB and 9% (10) after ILI (P < 0.001). Disposition index (DI) increased in all treatment groups (all P<0.05), although more in the surgery groups (both P < 0.001). Stimulated proinsulin-to-insulin (PI/I) ratio decreased in both surgery groups (both P < 0.001), but to a greater extent in the surgery group with AGT at baseline (P < 0.001). Post surgery, patients with NGT at baseline had higher DI and lower stimulated PI/I ratio than controls (both P < 0.027). Gastric bypass surgery improved beta cell function to a significantly greater extent than ILI. Supra-physiological insulin secretion and proinsulin processing may indicate excessive beta cell function after gastric bypass surgery.",10.1530/EJE-10-0804,,,,646
1208,Laparoscopic gastric plication versus mini-gastric bypass surgery in the treatment of morbid obesity: a randomized clinical trial.,"Laparoscopic gastric plication (LGP) is emerging as a safe and effective bariatric procedure. However, there are no reports on the comparison between the efficacy and complications of LGP and laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass (LMGB), which is still an investigational bariatric procedure. The objective of this study was to compare safety and efficacy of LGP and LMGB in the treatment of morbid obesity in a one-year follow-up study. Forty patients met the National Institutes of Health criteria and were randomly assigned to receive either LGP (n = 20) or LMGB (n = 20) by a block randomization method. Early and late complications, body mass index (BMI), excess weight loss, and obesity-related co-morbidities were determined at the 1-year follow-up. Operative time and mean length of hospitalization were shorter in the LGP group (71.0 minutes versus 125.0 minutes, P<.001, and 1.6 days versus 5.2 days; P<.001, respectively). The mean percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) at 12 months follow-up was 66.9% in the LMGB group and 60.8% in the LGP group (P = .34). Improvement was observed in all co-morbidities in both groups, with the exception of hyperlipidemia, which remained unresolved in 4 patients. Lower incidence of iron deficiency occurred in the LGP group (P = .035). Rehospitalization and reoperation were not required in any cases. Considering the cost of instruments used in the LMGB procedure and operative time, LGP saved approximately $2,500 per case compared with LMGB. Both LGP and LMGB are effective weight loss procedures. LGP proved to be a simpler and less costly procedure compared with LMGB with a lower risk of iron deficiency during a 1-year follow-up study.",10.1016/j.soard.2013.07.012,,,,647
316,Effects of Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy on Bone Mineral Density and Bone Turnover Markers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"There is a growing interest in the post-operative bone-related effects of bariatric surgery. However, little is known about the comparative effects of the most commonly performed bariatric procedures, namely Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). To systematically assess the differences in areal bone mineral density (aBMD) and biochemical and hormonal markers of bone metabolism among patients undergoing RYGB and SG. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies aBMD at different sites, as well as bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), 25-OH-vitamin D, calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) after RYGB and SG. Fourteen studies were included (717 patients, 50.63% in the RYGB arm). Based on data collected at 1Â year, 2Â years andâ€‰>â€‰2Â years, there were no significant differences in aBMD measurements at the total hip, lumbar spine, femoral neck, and the whole body with no statistical heterogeneity among different comparisons. Patients in the RYGB group showed significantly higher concentrations of BALP at 1Â year (SMDâ€‰=â€‰0.52, 95%CI, 0.23-0.81, pâ€‰=â€‰0.0004) and PTH atâ€‰>â€‰2Â years of follow-up (SMDâ€‰=â€‰0.68, 95%CI, 0.31-1.05, pâ€‰=â€‰0.0003) compared to the SG group. There were no significant differences in aBMD measurements at the hip, lumbar spine, femoral neck, and the total body following RYGB and SG procedures. However, BALP and PTH concentrations were significantly higher after RYGB surgeries compared to SG. Attention should be paid to patients undergoing RYGB to prevent the expected skeletal fragility over time.",10.1007/s00268-021-06429-1,,,,648
243,Loop versus Roux-en-Y duodenojejunal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy for type 2 diabetes: short-term outcomes of a single-center randomized controlled trial.,"Duodenojejunal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (DJB-SG) is a novel bariatric surgery composed of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and duodenojejunal anastomosis. Both loop and Roux-en-Y DJB-SGs were reported to have acceptable hypoglycemic and weight loss outcomes, but it remains unclear which reconstruction method is better regarding therapeutic efficacy and safety for type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study was undertaken to prospectively compare the short-term therapeutic outcomes and surgical safety of loop versus Roux-en-Y DJB-SG. University hospital. A total of 96 patients with T2D with body mass index of 27.5-40 kg/m2 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to undergo loop or Roux-en-Y DJB-SG from January 2020 to December 2020. The primary end point was to determine the 1-year T2D remission rate. Additionally, medical cost, operative outcomes, weight loss, metabolic improvement, nutritional status, and gastrointestinal disorders at 1-year follow-up also were determined. The preoperative data were comparable at baseline. The 1-year follow-up rate was 89.6% (43 of 48 patients) for loop DJB-SG and 93.8% (45 of 48 patients) for Roux-en-Y DJB-SG. The T2D remission rates were 93.02% (40 of 43) for loop DJB-SG and 88.89% (40 of 45) for Roux-en-Y DJB-SG at 1-year follow-up. Loop DJB-SG patients exhibited higher total weight loss (30.85% Â± 7.24% versus 26.11% Â± 7.12%), shorter operative times, and less medical cost than Roux-en-Y DJB-SG patients. However, there was no statistical difference regarding lipid profiles, major postoperative complications, nutritional status, and gastrointestinal disorders between the 2Â groups. Despite similar hypoglycemic effects, loop DJB-SG was simpler and exhibited better weight loss and less medical cost than Roux-en-Y DJB-SG. Thus, loop DJB-SG was better than Roux-en-Y DJB-SG for T2D.",10.1016/j.soard.2022.07.003,,,,649

The role of probiotic supplementation after bariatric procedures remains to be determined. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07 supplementation on nutritional and metabolic parameters after RYGB. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Patients were assigned to receive either a probiotic supplement (FloraVantageÂ®) or placebo for three consecutive months, beginning 7Â days after surgery. Anthropometric and biochemical indexes were evaluated in the preoperative period and at the end of the study. Following RYGB, serum 25-OH vitamin D increased in both groups compared to baseline; however, this increase was significant only in the probiotic group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.004). Vitamin B12 levels tended to be higher in the probiotic group compared to the placebo group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.063), and triglyceride levels showed a significant reduction in the probiotic group only (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). In addition, a significant reduction was observed in the anthropometric parameters and glycemic profile (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) in both groups.

172,DEPRESSIVE AND EATING DISORDERS IN PATIENTS POST-BARIATRIC SURGERY WITH WEIGHT REGAIN: A DESCRIPTIVE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY.,"Although bariatric surgery is today's gold standard treatment for obesity, weight regain affects the success rate of the procedure. Recent studies have identified psychiatric and neurological factors as possible causes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of psychiatric diseases on the outcome and long-term success of bariatric surgeries and find a weight regain threshold that has an acceptable sensibility to mental health-related issues to be used in research and clinical studies. This is a observational study of bariatric patients submitted to Roux-en-Y bypass or sleeve gastrectomy, with a postoperative time of 2-10 years to access weight regain, depression, and binge-eating disorder. Of 217 patients studied, 163 were women and 54 were men, with an average postoperative time of 5.2Â±2.6 years. Weight regain was experienced in 35% of the patients, binge-eating disorder in 24.9%, and depression in 24%. Theâ€‰greater weight before surgery, body mass index (BMI), percentage increase to maximum weight loss, and time postoperatively all have a significant positive correlation with weight regain (p=0.045, p=0.026, p<0.001, and p<0.001, respectively). A significant association between binge-eating disorder, depression, and anxiety with weight regain (p=0.004, p=0.008, and p=0.001, respectively) was found. The significant weight regain rates with significant impact on psychiatric disorders highlight the need for continuous postoperative monitoring focused on the psychiatric aspects of obesity to aid surgeries' long-term success.",10.1590/0102-672020230002e1725,,,,651
358,Gastrointestinal Hormones and Î²-Cell Function After Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial (Oseberg).,"Whether Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) differentially affect postprandial gastrointestinal hormones and Î²-cell function in type 2 diabetes remains unclear. We aimed to compare gastrointestinal hormones and Î²-cell function, assessed by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) 5 weeks and 1 year after surgery, hypothesizing higher glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels and greater Î²-cell response to glucose after RYGB than after SG. This study was a randomized, triple-blind, single-center trial at a tertiary care center in Norway. The primary outcomes were diabetes remission and IVGTT-derived Î²-cell function. Participants with obesity and type 2 diabetes were allocated (1:1) to RYGB or SG. We measured gastrointestinal hormone profiles and insulin secretion as Î²-cell glucose sensitivity (Î²-GS) derived from 180-minute OGTTs. Participants were 106 patients (67% women), mean (SD) age 48 (10) years. Diabetes remission rates at 1 year were higher after RYGB than after SG (77% vs 48%; P = 0.002). Incremental area under the curve (iAUC0-180) GLP-1 and Î²-GS increased more after RYGB than after SG, with 1-year between-group difference 1173 pmol/L*min (95% CI, 569-1776; P = 0.0010) and 0.45 pmol/kg/min/mmol (95% CI, 0.15-0.75; P = 0.0032), respectively. After surgery, fasting and postprandial ghrelin levels were higher and decremental AUC0-180 ghrelin, iAUC0-180 glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, and iAUC0-60 glucagon were greater after RYGB than after SG. Diabetes remission at 1 year was associated with higher Î²-GS and higher GLP-1 secretion. RYGB was associated with greater improvement in Î²-cell function and higher postprandial GLP-1 levels than SG.",10.1210/clinem/dgab643,,,,652
1047,FGF 19 and Bile Acids Increase Following Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass but Not After Medical Management in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.,"This study aims to quantify changes in fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) and bile acids (BAs) in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes randomized to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) vs intensive medical management (IMM) and matched for similar reduction in HbA1c after 1 year of treatment. Blood samples were drawn from patients who underwent a test meal challenge before and 1 year after IMM (nâ€‰=â€‰15) or RYGB (nâ€‰=â€‰15). Mean HbA1c decreased from 9.7 to 6.4% after RYGB and from 9.1 to 6.1% in the IMM group. At 12 months, the number of diabetes medications used per subject in the RYGB group (2.5â€‰Â±â€‰0.5) was less than in the IMM group (4.6â€‰Â±â€‰0.3). After RYGB, FGF19 increased in the fasted (93â€‰Â±â€‰15 to 152â€‰Â±â€‰19 pg/ml; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.008) and postprandial states (area under the curve (AUC), 10.8â€‰Â±â€‰1.9 to 23.4â€‰Â±â€‰4.1 pgâ€‰Ã—â€‰h/mlâ€‰Ã—â€‰10(3); Pâ€‰=â€‰0.006) but remained unchanged following IMM. BAs increased after RYGB (AUC Ã—10(3), 6.63â€‰Â±â€‰1.3 to 15.16â€‰Â±â€‰2.56 Î¼Mâ€‰Ã—â€‰h; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.003) and decreased after IMM (AUC Ã—10(3), 8.22â€‰Â±â€‰1.24 to 5.70â€‰Â±â€‰0.70; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01). No changes were observed in the ratio of 12Î±-hydroxylated/non-12Î±-hyroxylated BAs. Following RYGB, FGF19 AUC correlated with BAs (râ€‰=â€‰0.54, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.04) and trended negatively with HbA1c (râ€‰=â€‰-0.44; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.09); these associations were not observed after IMM. BA and FGF19 levels increased after RYGB but not after IMM in subjects who achieved similar improvement in glycemic control.

1645,Changes in measured resting energy expenditure after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for clinically severe obesity are not related to bypass limb-length.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) for clinically severe obesity (CSO) results in a 'paradoxical' response of the measured resting energy expenditure (MREE) in which the MREE remains within the predicted range based upon the Harris-Benedict (HB) equation, despite a significant decrease in caloric intake to 500-1000 kcal/day. The mechanism for this response is unknown. A study was undertaken to determine whether the changes in MREE after RYGB are related to limb-length of the gastric bypass. A prospective clinical trial of varying limb-lengths based on body mass index (BMI) in patients having RYGB for CSO. The records of patients who underwent RYGB for CSO and had MREE measured at baseline, 6 months and 12 months postoperation were reviewed. MREE was performed using a Med Graphics CCM system after an overnight fast or at least 4 hours after a light meal, and a 30 minute rest in a supine position in a neutral environment, on the same day of the week between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Patients were selected for RYGB in accordance with NIH recommendations. RYGB was performed in a standardized fashion with the Roux limb-length varied as follows: (A) BMI < or = 51 kg/m2 - 75 cm limb (n = 20); (B) BMI < or = 51 kg/m2 - 150 cm limb (n = 16); (C) BMI > or = 51 kg/m2 - 150 cm limb (n = 18); or (D) BMI > or = 51 kg/m2 - 250 cm limb (n = 6). Data from 60 patients (nine male, 51 female; mean age 39 years; mean baseline BMI 51.5 +/- 10 kg/m2; mean baseline weight 145 +/- 32 kg) were analyzed. There were no significant differences in MREE or percentage HB-predicted energy expenditure between the groups. These data suggest that the observed changes in MREE following RYGB for CSO are not related to the limb-length of the bypass.",10.1381/096089298765554331,,,,654
882,Type 2 diabetes remission rates 1-year post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and validation of the DiaRem score: the Ontario Bariatric Network experience.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is associated with the remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). There are a number of scoring systems available that help predict type 2 diabetes remission rates after bariatric surgery; however, relatively few have been validated externally. The DiaRem score, comprised of four preoperative variables (age, haemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], sulfonylurea and insulin-sensitizing agent use and insulin use), allows for the identification of patients who are most likely to have DM remission following RYGB. Our primary objective was to determine the variables predictive of DM remission 1 year post-RYGB, determine how well the DiaRem score predicts DM remission 1 year post-RYGB and identify the optimal cut-off DiaRem score. The study is based on results of RYGB performed across multiple centres in Ontario, Canada, overseen by the Centre for Surgical Invention and Innovation in Hamilton, with direction from the Ontario Bariatric Network. Regression analysis was used to determine the predictive value of demographic and clinical variables and that of the DiaRem score. The optimal DiaRem cut-off score was determined using sensitivity and specificity analysis. Of 3874 patients in the Ontario Bariatric Registry between January 2010 and February 2015, 915 had complete 1-year follow-up data. Among these, 15 were not classified as having DM at baseline and were excluded. Of the remaining 900 patients with type 2 diabetes and who underwent RYGB surgery, 333 (37.0%) had DM remission at 1-year follow-up. Three of four DiaRem variables (age, HbA1c, insulin use), in addition to use of any hypoglycaemic agent, were associated with DM remission. DiaRem score had moderate predictive value. A DiaRem score cut-off of <5 had a sensitivity of 71.8% and specificity of 71.3%. This study provides guidance to clinicians in using the DiaRem score to inform the selection and prioritization of patients to ensure timely access to bariatric surgery for those who are likely to benefit the most.",10.1111/cob.12189,,,,655

1059,Anaemia and related nutrient deficiencies after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To obtain a pooled risk estimate on the long-term impact of anaemia and related nutritional deficiencies in patients receiving Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. Systematic review and meta-analysis. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched to identify English reports published before 16 May 2014. Articles with case numbers >100, follow-up period >12â€…months, and complete data from both before and after surgery were selected. Outcomes of interest were changes in baseline measurements of proportion of patients with anaemia, by haemoglobin, haematocrit, ferritin, iron, vitamin B12 and folate levels. Two reviewers independently reviewed data and selected six prospective and nine retrospective studies with a total of 5909 patients. A random effect model with inverse variance weighting was used to calculate summary estimates of outcomes at 6, 12, 24 and 36â€…months postoperatively. Proportion of patients with anaemia was 12.2% at baseline, which, respectively, increased to 20.9% and 25.9% at 12 and 24â€…months follow-up, consistent with decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit levels. Although the serum iron level did not change substantially after surgery, the frequency of patients with ferritin deficiency increased from 7.9% at baseline to 13.4% and 23.0% at 12 and 24â€…months, respectively, postoperation. Vitamin B12 deficiency increased from 2.3% at baseline to 6.5% at 12â€…months after surgery in those subjects receiving RYGB. There was no obvious increase in folate deficiency. RYGB surgery is associated with an increased risk of anaemia and deficiencies of iron and vitamin B12, but not folate. Ferritin is more sensitive when serum iron level is within normal range.",10.1136/bmjopen-2014-006964,,,,657

This study aimed to assess plasma phospholipid fatty acid profiles following adjustable gastric banding (AGB), which restricts dietary fat intake, versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), which also promotes fat malabsorption. Serial measures were obtained before and 1 and 6Â months from women undergoing RYGB (Nâ€‰=â€‰13) and AGB (Nâ€‰=â€‰5). Measures included the composition of plasma fatty acids in phospholipids, dietary intake, and body fat mass. Friedman and Mann-Whitney tests were used to assess differences over time and between groups, respectively, pâ€‰<â€‰0.05. Dietary intake of fats decreased equally at 1 and 6Â months following RYGB and AGB. By 6Â months, the RYGB group lost more body fat. There were no remarkable changes in EFA in plasma phospholipids following AGB. However, following RYGB, a transient increase in 20:4N6 (+18Â %) and a decrease in 20:3N6 at 1 (-47Â %) and 6Â months (-47Â %) were observed. Similar changes were observed in N3 fatty acids following RYGB, including a transient increase in 22:6N3 (+11Â %) and decreases in 20:5N3 (-79 and -67Â % at 1 and 6Â months, respectively). EFA status improved following surgery in the RYGB group. We demonstrate alterations in plasma EFA following RYGB. The status of EFA improved, but the decrease in 20:5N3, the precursor for anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, may be a concern.",10.1007/s11695-015-1876-3,,,,658
691,Does the RYGB common limb length influence hypertension remission and cardiometabolic risk factors? Data from the GATEWAY trial.,"Although Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) results in significant weight loss and cardiometabolic risk factors improvements; there is no consensus whether limb lengths may influence these results. To evaluate the correlations between the common limb length (CLL) and hypertension remission rate, cardiometabolic risk factors, and nutritional parameters after RYGB. Private Hospital, Brazil. GATEWAY is a randomized trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of RYGB on hypertension improvement and other cardiometabolic risk factors in patients with grade I and II obesity compared with medical therapy. The follow-up was 1 year. We measured the entire bowel in all patients and used a 150-cm alimentary limb and a 100-cm biliopancreatic limb. Univariate logistic regression was used to estimate the relationship between CLL and hypertension remission. Pearson and Spearman correlation were used to evaluate the correlation between the CLL and the percentage changes of cardiometabolic risk factors and nutritional parameters. From 100 randomized patients, 45 were submitted to RYGB and completed the follow-up. Mean CLL was 466.3 Â± 86.4 cm. Of patients, 55.6% from the RYGB group showed remission of hypertension. CLL length was not significantly associated with hypertension remission (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] for 50 units increase in CLL: .97 [.68; 1.38], Pâ€¯=â€¯.88). Consistently, we found no correlations between CLL and all changes in cardiometabolic risk factors and nutritional parameters. In a proximal RYGB, CLL does not influence hypertension remission, cardiometabolic risk factors, and nutritional parameters.",10.1016/j.soard.2018.11.022,,,,659
249,Effects of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy on Î²-Cell Function at 1 Year After Surgery: A Systematic Review.,"Bariatric surgery is a highly effective obesity treatment resulting in substantial weight loss and improved glucose metabolism. We hereby aimed to summarize available evidence of the effect of the 2 most common bariatric surgery procedures, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG), on dynamic measures of Î²-cell function (BCF). A systematic search of the literature was conducted in 3 bibliographic databases for studies reporting effects of RYGB and/or SG on BCF assessed using dynamic metabolic perturbation (oral or intravenous bolus stimulation), performed before and 1 year (Â±3 months) after surgery. Twenty-seven unique studies (6 randomized controlled trials and 21 observational studies), involving a total of 1856 obese adults, were included for final analysis. Twenty-five and 9 studies report effects of RYGB and SG on BCF, respectively (7 studies compared the 2 procedures). Seven studies report results according to presurgical diabetes status. Owing to variable testing procedures and BCF indices reported, no meta-analysis was feasible, and data were summarized qualitatively. For both surgical procedures, most studies suggest an increase in BCF and disposition index, particularly when using oral stimulation, with a more pronounced increase in diabetic than nondiabetic individuals. Additionally, limited indications for greater effects after RYGB versus SG were found. The quality of the included studies was, in general, satisfactory. The considerable heterogeneity of test protocols and outcome measures underscore the need for a harmonization of BCF testing in future research.",10.1210/clinem/dgac446,,,,660
1009,Intraabdominal Pressure and Postoperative Discomfort in Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) Surgery: a Randomized Study.,"High intraabdominal pressure (IAP) during laparoscopic surgery has been associated with postoperative discomfort. Effects on nausea and access have not been subjected to randomized studies. In cholecystectomy, lower IAP may cause less pain, but nausea and surgical access in RYGB surgery have not been investigated. We studied the influence of two IAP levels on surgical access, operation time, postoperative pain, and nausea. Fifty consecutive female gastric bypass patients were randomized to intraabdominal pressure of 12 (IAP12) or 18 (IAP18)â€‰mm Hg. Surgeons and personnel were blinded to randomization; study groups were well matched for age and BMI. Operative time was noted in minutes. Visual analogue scales were used for assessing access and for patients assessing pain (abdomen-shoulder) and nausea (supine-standing) at six time points during the first 16 postoperative hours. Rescue medication was recorded. In 3/25 patients in the IAP12 group, the code was broken due to access problems vs. 0/25 in the IAP18 group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.1398). Operative time did not differ. Access was significantly better for IAP18 (92.2â€‰Â±â€‰2.3 vs. 69.3â€‰Â±â€‰4.2; pâ€‰=â€‰0.0001). Postoperative shoulder pain was maximal after 6Â h but throughout less than in the abdomen (pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001); there were no differences in pain between IAP18 and IAP12 (pâ€‰=â€‰0.7408). Postoperative nausea was significantly greater standing than supine but without differences between groups. Higher IAP gives better surgical access in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with no negative effect on pain or nausea.",10.1007/s11695-016-2091-6,,,,661
1610,The effect of erythromycin on bile excretion and proximal small bowel motility following divided gastric bypass surgery: a prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial.,"No conclusive data exists supporting the use of any prokinetic agent in the postoperative setting. The study was designed to examine the effect of erythromycin on small bowel motility in a placebo-controlled trial of post gastric bypass patients utilizing a standardized nuclear medicine test. A consecutive series of 21 patients undergoing elective gastric bypass surgery for morbid obesity between September 1999 and March 2001 were enrolled in this prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial. Standard open, divided gastric bypass was performed. Patients were randomized to receive either erythromycin 250 mg i. v. (11 patients) or placebo (10 patients) every 8 hours. On postoperative day 2, a hepatic iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan was obtained. Tracer movement through the biliary tree and proximal small bowel was quantified and compared. Tracer clearance from the liver and biliary tree was no different between groups from time of injection through 1 hour. Tracer material clearance from the duodenum into the jejunum was no different between the erythromycin and control groups at 1 hour, 37% +/- 13% and 37% +/- 22% respectively (P = 0.95). At 4 hours, clearance was greater in the erythromycin group, 77% +/- 6%, compared to control, 60% +/- 20% (P = 0.036). The rate of tracer change between hour 1 and 4 (slope) was steeper in the erythromycin group (P = 0.048). Erythromycin increases intestinal transit in the postoperative setting.",10.1381/096089202320995538,,,,662
1443,"International multicenter study of safety and effectiveness of Swedish Adjustable Gastric Band in 1-, 3-, and 5-year follow-up cohorts.","No long-term, international, multicenter studies of the effectiveness and safety of the SAGB in morbid obesity have been previously published. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of the Swedish Adjustable Gastric Band (SAGB) at 6 bariatric centers in Australia, Europe, and Brazil, with < or =5 years of follow-up; the effect on patient covariates; and changes in co-morbidity. A 2-phase study design was used, involving both retrospective and prospective data. SAGB was implanted by way of the pars flaccida 1, 3, and 5 years previously. The retrospective phase entailed a review of the records. The prospective phase included a subset of eligible patients who agreed to undergo additional clinical assessments. The percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL), patient level predictors, change in co-morbidities, and complications were analyzed. A total of 481 patients in 3 mutually exclusive follow-up cohorts (1 yr, n = 200; 3 yr, n = 184; 5 yr, n = 97) participated in the present study. Of these 481 patients, 339 (1 yr, n = 139; 3 yr, n = 131; 5 yr, n = 69) underwent prospective evaluations. The mean %EWL was 43.5% + or - 21.8%, 57.7% + or - 25.9%, and 49.8% + or - 27.6% and the mean change in body mass index was -7.64, -10.75, and -9.52 in the 1-, 3-, and 5-year cohorts, respectively (P <.001). Gender and age did not predict the %EWL; however, a greater preoperative body mass index was inversely related to the %EWL. Longer postimplantation times were associated with greater improvement in co-morbidities and with greater frequencies of reoperation. Fewer than 15% of the patients in the 5-year cohort had undergone band removal and 10% required band revisions. No fatal or life-threatening complications occurred. SAGB is safe and effective in inducing weight loss and improvement of co-morbidities in morbidly obese patients at international bariatric centers at 1, 3, and 5 years postoperatively.",10.1016/j.soard.2009.04.012,,,,663
603,Bariatric surgery for Prader-Willi syndrome was ineffective in producing sustainable weight loss: Long term results for up to 10 years.,"Obesity control in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is notoriously difficult. The role of bariatric surgery in PWS remains controversial as long-term data are lacking. To evaluate the 10-year outcomes of bariatric surgery in PWS. This was a prospective observational study on PWS patients who received bariatric surgery and multidisciplinary follow-up programmes for obesity control. Outcomes on weight reduction and comorbidity resolution were evaluated. Between 2008 and 2013, five PWS patients (two males, mean age 19.2 Â± 3.0 years) with body mass index of 47.3 Â± 6.9 kg m-2 received sleeve gastrectomy (n = 2), one anastomosis gastric bypass (n = 2), and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 1) after failing all non-operative weight loss programmes. The median follow-up was 8.4 Â± 2.2 years. The best mean percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) was achieved at 2 years (24.7%). %TWL dropped to 23.3% at 3 years, 11.9% at 5 years, 4.1% at 8 years, and 0% at 10 years. Each patient had at least three comorbidities preoperatively, but none of them had resolution of any one of the comorbidities at the last follow-up. Bariatric surgery could not produce sustainable long-term weight loss or comorbidity resolution in PWS. This study suggests that bariatric surgery cannot be recommended to PWS patients as a standard treatment.",10.1111/ijpo.12575,,,,664
29,Short-term effects of gastric bypass versus sleeve gastrectomy on high LDL cholesterol: The BASALTO randomized clinical trial.,"There has been a substantial increase in the use of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) to treat morbid obesity despite observational evidence demonstrating the superiority of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) for reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The main aim was to ascertain whether high LDL cholesterol levels should be considered when selecting the most appropriate surgical procedure for each patient (RYGB or SG). In this single-center, randomized clinical trial using intention-to-treat analysis, 38 patients with severe obesity and elevated levels of LDL cholesterol were randomly assigned to undergo RYGB or SG. The primary outcome was LDL cholesterol remission at 12 months, defined as LDL cholesterolâ€‰<â€‰3.36 nmol/l without lipid-lowering medications. Secondary outcomes included changes in weight, other comorbidities, qualitative lipoprotein traits, cholesterol esters, glycoproteins, cholesterol absorption and synthesis metabolites and complications. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed that LDL cholesterol remission occurred in 66.6% of RYGB patients compared to 27.8% of SG patients (pâ€‰=â€‰0.019). Among patients completing follow-up, RYGB demonstrated superior remission (80.0% vs. 29.4%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.005). Exclusive benefits of RYGB included a reduction in large, medium, and small LDL particles. Cholesterol absorption markers showed differential behavior after both techniques: campesterol (Î” -15.2Â Âµg/mg, 95% CI -30.2 to -0.1) decreased after RYGB, and sitosterol (Î” 21.1Â Âµg/mg, 95% CI 0.9 to 41.2), cholestanol (Î” 30.6Â Âµg/mg, 95% CI 14.8 to 57.9) and campesterol (Î” 18.4Â Âµg/mg, 95% CI 4.4 to 32.3) increased after SG. No differences in weight loss, cholesterol esters, glycoproteins, cholesterol synthesis metabolites or postoperative complications were observed between techniques. In conclusion, RYGB is superior to SG in terms of short-term of high LDL cholesterol remission. Furthermore, RYGB also led to a greater improvement in lipoprotein parameters that confer an atherogenic profile. Therefore, the presence of elevated levels of LDL cholesterol should be considered when determining the optimal bariatric surgery procedure for each patient.

12,Effect of tailoring biliopancreatic limb length based on total small bowel length versus standard limb length in one anastomosis gastric bypass: 1-year outcomes of the TAILOR randomized clinical superiority trial.,"Tailoring the biliopancreatic limb length in one anastomosis gastric bypass is proposed as beneficial in retrospective studies, yet randomized trials are lacking. The aim of this double-blind, single-centre RCT was to ascertain whether tailoring biliopancreatic limb length based on total small bowel length (TSBL) results in superior outcomes after one anastomosis gastric bypass compared with a fixed 150â€…cm biliopancreatic limb length. Eligible patients, meeting International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders (IFSO) criteria for metabolic bariatric surgery, scheduled for primary one anastomosis gastric bypass surgery, and willing to be randomized, underwent TSBL measurement during surgery. When TSBL measurement was feasible, patients were randomly assigned to a standard 150â€…cm biliopancreatic limb length or a tailored biliopancreatic limb based on TSBL: TSBL less than 500â€…cm, biliopancreatic limb 150â€…cm; TSBL 500-700â€…cm, biliopancreatic limb 180â€…cm; and TSBL greater than 700â€…cm, biliopancreatic limb 210â€…cm. The primary outcome was percentage total weight loss at 5 years. Between September 2020 and August 2022, 212 patients were randomized into the standard biliopancreatic limb group (105 patients) or the tailored biliopancreatic limb group (107 patients). The mean(s.d.) TSBL was 657(128)â€…cm (range 295-1020â€…cm). In the tailored group, 150, 180, and 210â€…cm biliopancreatic limb lengths were applied to 8.4%, 53.3%, and 38.3% of patients respectively. The mean(s.d.) 1-year percentage total weight loss was 32.8(6.9)% in the standard group and 33.1(6.2)% in the tailored group (P = 0.787). Nutritional deficiencies and short-term complications showed no significant differences. Tailoring biliopancreatic limb length based on TSBL is safe and feasible. One year after surgery, it is not superior to a standard biliopancreatic limb length of 150â€…cm in terms of percentage total weight loss. Dutch Trial Register, NL7945.",10.1093/bjs/znae219,,,,666
121,Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Improves Adiponectin to Leptin Ratio and Inflammatory Profile in Severely Obese Women with and without Metabolic Syndrome: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Obesity is a troubling public health problem as it increases risks of sleep disorders, respiratory complications, systemic arterial hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome (MetS). As a measure to counteract comorbidities associated with severe obesity, bariatric surgery stands out. This study aimed to investigate the adiponectin/leptin ratio in women with severe obesity with and without MetS who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and to characterize the biochemical, glucose, and inflammatory parameters of blood in women with severe obesity before and after RYGB. Were enrolled females with severe obesity undergoing RYGP with MetS (n = 11) and without (n = 39). Anthropometric data and circulating levels of glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), non-HDL total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), adiponectin, and leptin were assessed before and 6 months after RYGB. Significant reductions in weight, body mass index, and glucose, total cholesterol, LDL, and leptin were observed after surgery, with higher levels of HDL, adiponectin, and adiponectin/leptin ratio being observed after surgery compared to the preoperative values of those. This study demonstrated that weight loss induced by RYGB in patients with severe obesity with or without MetS improved biochemical and systemic inflammatory parameters, particularly the adiponectin/leptin ratio.",10.3390/nu15153312,,,,667
435,"Role of Gastrointestinal Hormones as a Predictive Factor for Long-Term Diabetes Remission: Randomized Trial Comparing Metabolic Gastric Bypass, Sleeve Gastrectomy, and Greater Curvature Plication.","Long-term studies comparing the mechanisms of different bariatric techniques for T2DM remission are scarce. We aimed to compare type 2 diabetes (T2DM) remission after a gastric bypass with a 200-cm biliopancreatic limb (mRYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), and greater curvature plication (GCP), and to assess if the initial secretion of gastrointestinal hormones may predict metabolic outcomes at 5Â years. Forty-five patients with mean BMI of 39.4(1.9)kg/m2 and T2DM with HbA1c of 7.7(1.9)% were randomized to mRYGB, SG, or GCP. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters, fasting concentrations of PYY, ghrelin, glucagon, and AUC of GLP-1 after SMT were determined prior to and at months 1 and 12 after surgery. At 5-year follow-up, anthropometrical and biochemical parameters were determined. Total weight loss percentage (TWL%) at year 1 and GLP-1 AUC at months 1 and 12 were higher in the mRYGB than in the SG and GCP. TWL% remained greater at 5Â years in mRYGB group -â€‰27.32 (7.8) vs. SG -â€‰18.00 (10.6) and GCP -â€‰14.83 (7.8), pÂ =â€‰0.001. At 5Â years, complete T2DM remission was observed in 46.7% after mRYGB vs. 20.0% after SG and 6.6% after GCP, pÂ <â€‰0.001. In the multivariate analysis, shorter T2DM duration (OR 0.186), pÂ =â€‰0.008, and the GLP-1 AUC at 1Â month (OR 7.229), pÂ =â€‰0.023, were prognostic factors for complete T2DM remission at 5-year follow-up. Long-term T2DM remission is mostly achieved with hypoabsortive techniques such as mRYGB. Increased secretion of GLP-1 after surgery and shorter disease duration were the main predictors of T2DM remission at 5Â years.",10.1007/s11695-020-05192-x,,,,668
1570,"Beneficial effects of humidified, warmed carbon dioxide insufflation during laparoscopic bariatric surgery: a randomized clinical trial.","Recent data has shown that the use of warmed, humidified carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation during laparoscopic surgery may be associated with better outcomes. We performed a randomized, doubleblind, prospective controlled clinical trial of 30 patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP). Patients were randomized into 2 groups. The first group (group 1, n=15) received standard (dry, room temperature) CO2 for insufflation during the surgery, while the second group (group 2, n=15) received warmed (35 degrees C) and humidified (95%) CO2. Patients received postoperative analgesia from morphine delivered via a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. Pain scores (on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain) were measured postoperatively at 3 h, 6 h, 1 day and 2 days. The amount of morphine that was delivered through the PCA was also measured at the same time intervals. Operating-room (OR) time, core temperature, and total hospital length of stay were documented. Postoperative pain as documented by pain scores and narcotic usage were not statistically different in the 2 groups. We demonstrated a statistically significant difference (mean+/-SD) in OR time (76+/-16 min vs 101+/-34 min, P=0.02), total hospital length of stay (3.2+/-.4 days vs 4.0+/-.9 days, P=0.01) and end-of-case core temperature (36.2+/-.5 degrees C vs 35.7+/-.6 degrees C, P=0.02) in group 2 compared with group 1. The use of warmed, humidified CO2 insufflation in bariatric patients undergoing LRYGBP was not associated with any significant benefit with regards to postoperative pain.",10.1381/0960892052993530,,,,669
952,Diabetes improvement and resolution following laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy (LVSG) versus laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) procedures: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is growing in both developed and developing countries and is strongly linked with the prevalence of obesity. Bariatric surgical procedures such as laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy (LVSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) are increasingly being utilized to manage related comorbid chronic conditions, including type 2 diabetes. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was undertaken using the PRISMA guidelines to investigate the postoperative impact on diabetes resolution following LVSG versus LRYGB. Seven RCTs involving a total of 732 patients (LVSG nÂ =Â 365, LRYGB nÂ =Â 367) met inclusion criteria. Significant diabetes resolution or improvement was reported with both procedures across all time points. Similarly, measures of glycemic control (HbA1C and fasting blood glucose levels) improved with both procedures, with earlier improvements noted in LRYGB that stabilized and did not differ from LVSG at 12Â months postoperatively. Early improvements in measures of insulin resistance in both procedures were also noted in the studies that investigated this. This systematic review of RCTs suggests that both LVSG and LRYGB are effective in resolving or improving preoperative type 2 diabetes in obese patients during the reported 3- to 5-year follow-up periods. However, further studies are required before longer-term outcomes can be elucidated. Areas identified that need to be addressed for future studies on this topic include longer follow-up periods, standardized definitions and time point for reporting, and financial analysis of outcomes obtained between surgical procedures to better inform procedure selection.",10.1007/s00464-016-5202-5,,,,670
892,Midterm effects of bariatric surgery in patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes.,"To assess the extent and durability of the glucose-lowering effect of bariatric surgery (BS) in patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Even though BS in patients with insulin-treated T2D is likely to increase, data on the midterm effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy in this group of patients are scant. University hospital. Prospective observational study (4.9Â±1.9 yr) on T2D outcomes, changes in hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), and diabetes therapy in individuals with insulin-treated T2D undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 24) or sleeve gastrectomy (n = 50). Diabetes remission was initially observed in 20 of 74 individuals, but relapse occurred in 13 of the 20 (65.0%) patients. Overall, marked initial reduction of HbA1C and high rates of insulin cessation were observed (HbA1C nadir 5.9%Â±0.9%, insulin cessation rate 66.2%). However, these were followed by progressive deterioration of HbA1C (HbA1C at last follow-up 7.4%Â±1.3%; P<.001) and need for insulin therapy reintroduction (rate of insulin cessation at last follow-up visit 54%; P = .04). In multivariate analysis, larger maximum percent excess weight loss and nonbasal bolus insulin therapy were identified as significant predictors of diabetes remission, insulin cessation, and durability of HbA1C<7%. In insulin-treated patients with T2DM, BS is associated with a low likelihood of midterm diabetes remission. Overall, in this group of patients, the marked initial improvement of glycemic control and insulin independence are of limited durability. In addition, in this group of patients, the need for prandrial insulin and lower postsurgical weight loss may hamper the beneficial effects of BS on glycemic control.",10.1016/j.soard.2016.12.030,,,,671
1109,Health-Related Quality-of-Life (HRQoL) on an Average of 12 Years After Gastric Bypass Surgery.,"It is evident that morbidly obese patients have a low health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL), and this low HRQoL has become a common reason for them to seek bariatric surgery. Several HRQoL studies demonstrate a dramatic postoperative improvement, but most of these have had a short follow-up period. An observational, cross-sectional study for HRQoL was conducted to study 486 patients (average age of 50.7â€‰Â±â€‰10.0 years, with 84 % of them being female) operated with gastric bypass (GBP) in the period 1993 to 2003 at the University Hospitals of Ã–rebro and Uppsala. Mean follow-up after gastric bypass was 11.5â€‰Â±â€‰2.7 years (range 7-17). Two HRQoL instruments were used, SF-36 and the Obesity-related Problems scale (OP). The study group was compared with two control groups, both matched for age and gender, one from the general population and one containing morbidly obese patients evaluated and awaiting bariatric surgery. The study group scored better in the SF-36 domains (all four physical domains and the vitality subscore) and OP scale compared to obese controls, but their HRQoL scores were lower than those of the general population. HRQoL was better among younger patients and in the following subgroups: men, patients with satisfactory weight loss, satisfied with the procedure, free from co-morbidities and gastrointestinal symptoms, employment, good oral status and those not hospitalised or regularly followed up for non-bariatric reasons. Long-term follow-up after GBP for morbid obesity showed better scores in most aspects of HRQoL compared to obese controls but did not achieve the levels of the general population. Patients with better medical outcome after gastric bypass operation had better HRQoL.",10.1007/s11695-014-1513-6,,,,672
1222,Patient factors associated with undergoing laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding vs Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for weight loss.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding are 2 commonly performed bariatric procedures in the US with different profiles for risk and effectiveness. Little is known about factors that might lead patients to proceed with one procedure over the other. We recruited and interviewed patients seeking bariatric surgery from 2 academic centers in Boston (response rate 70%). We conducted multivariable analyses to identify patient perceptions and clinical and behavioral characteristics that correlated with undergoing gastric banding (n = 239) vs gastric bypass (n = 297). After adjustment for socio-demographic and clinical factors, we found that older patients (odds ratio [OR] 1.03; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.05) and those with higher quality of life scores and higher levels of uncontrolled eating were more likely to undergo gastric banding as opposed to gastric bypass. In contrast, patients with type 2 diabetes (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.77), those who desired greater weight loss, and those who were willing to assume higher mortality risk to achieve their ideal weight were less likely to proceed with gastric banding. After initial adjustment, male sex and lower body mass index were associated with a likelihood of undergoing gastric banding; however, these factors were no longer significant after adjustment for other significant correlates such as patients' perceived ideal weight, predilection to assume risk to lose weight, and eating behavior. Patients' diabetes status, quality of life, eating behavior, ideal weight loss, and willingness to assume mortality risk to lose weight were associated with whether patients proceeded with gastric banding as opposed to gastric bypass. Other clinical factors were less important.",10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2013.08.004,,,,673
1620,Prevention of gallstone formation in morbidly obese patients undergoing rapid weight loss: results of a randomized controlled pilot study.,"An increased risk of gallstone (GS) formation has been linked to obesity and to episodes of rapid and significant weight loss. Previous reports have suggested that bile salt therapy (ursodeoxycholic acid) or prostaglandin inhibition (ibuprofen) may prevent gallstone formation in this high-risk group. The purpose of this study was to investigate GS prevention following bariatric surgery. Randomized double blind controlled trial. Sixty patients without gallstones preoperatively (gender, 9 male, 51 female; average preop wt, 349.6 lb; mean age, 38 years) were randomly assigned to receive urso (600 mg/day, n = 20), ibuprofen (600 mg/d, n = 20), or placebo (n = 20). At the time of standard open gastric bypass, intraoperative ultrasonography confirmed the absence of stones or microcalculi, and bile samples were collected via puncture of the gallbladder for bile lipid analysis. Following recovery and resumption of a bariatric diet, study medication was prescribed for the first 6 months postop. Gallbladder emptying and GS formation were assessed using ultrasonograms preop and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postop (gallbladder emptying following a high-fat liquid test meal was assessed preop, and at 3 and 6 months postop). Forty-one (68.3%, 8 male, 33 female) of the original 60 patients completed all phases of the study (15 urso, 15 ibuprofen, 11 placebo). The average weight loss was 98.5 +/- 7.2 lb over the 12-month period following bariatric surgery. Twenty-nine (71%) of 41 patients who completed the study developed GS. Of those who formed stones, 12 (41%) developed symptomatic GS and 8/12 (67%) underwent cholecystectomy (4 refused operation). Preoperative gallbladder emptying studies showed no differences in emptying between groups (urso 29%, ibuprofen 32%, and placebo 30%). There was no correlation found between the cholesterol saturation index (CSI mean 205.15, range 67-360) and the incidence of GS. There was a statistical difference (P < 0.01) between the ursodeoxycholic acid group and the ibuprofen group with respect to the incidence of stone formation. There was correlation between weight loss (mean 99 lb, range 21-278 lb) and GS formation, in that patients who lost more weight had a greater tendency to form gallstones. Complete medical compliance was achieved in only 17/60 (28%) of patients originally enrolled. This pilot study confirms the high incidence of gallstone formation (71% of assessed patients) associated with rapid weight loss in patients undergoing gastric bypass. Despite active enrollment in a supervised prevention trial, the two therapies investigated to reduce gallstone formation were not efficacious, likely because compliance with medical therapy was poor. These findings highlight the significant risk of gallstone formation in this patient cohort even when prevention strategies are utilized.",10.1006/jsre.2001.6322,,,,674
1630,Comparison of pulmonary function and postoperative pain after laparoscopic versus open gastric bypass: a randomized trial.,"Impairment of pulmonary function is common after upper abdominal operations. The purpose of this study was to compare postoperative pulmonary function and analgesic requirements in patients undergoing either laparoscopic or open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GBP). Seventy patients with a body mass index of 40 to 60 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic (n = 36) or open (n = 34) GBP. The two groups were similar in age, gender, body mass index, pulmonary history, and baseline pulmonary function. Pulmonary function studies were performed preoperatively and on postoperative days 1, 2, 3, and 7. Oxygen saturation and chest radiographs were performed on both groups preoperatively and on postoperative day 1. Postoperative pain was evaluated using a visual analog scale and the amount of narcotic consumed was recorded. Data are presented as mean +/- standard deviation. Laparoscopic GBP patients had significantly less impairment of pulmonary function than open GBP patients on the first three postoperative days (p < 0.05). By the 7th postoperative day, all pulmonary function parameters in the laparoscopic GBP group had returned to within preoperative levels, but only one parameter (peak expiratory flow) had returned to preoperative levels in the open GBP group. On the first postoperative day, laparoscopic GBP patients used less morphine than open GBP patients (46 +/- 31 mg versus 76 +/- 39 mg, respectively, p < 0.001), and visual analog scale pain scores at rest and during mobilization were lower after laparoscopic GBP than after open GBP (p < 0.05). Fewer patients after laparoscopic GBP than after open GBP developed hypoxemia (31% versus 76%, p < 0.001) and segmental atelectasis (6% versus 55%, p = 0.003). Laparoscopic gastric bypass resulted in less postoperative suppression of pulmonary function, decreased pain, improved oxygenation, and less atelectasis than open gastric bypass.",10.1016/s1072-7515(01)00822-5,,,,675
1643,Complications following Swedish adjustable gastric banding: a long-term follow-up.,"The Swedish adjustable gastric band (SAGB) has been in use since 1985. The aim of this study was to analyze short and long-term complications linked to the SAGB. Between August 1990 and December 1996, we operated on a series of 326 patients (78 men and 248 women) at the Huddinge University Hospital and the Norra Alvsborg County Hospital. The mean age of patients at surgery was 40 years (range 19-62). The mean preoperative weight was 125 kg (range 81-181). The mean excess weight was 80%. The mean time of follow-up was 28 months (range 6-76). Complications requiring reoperation included two (0.6%) band dislocations, six (1.8%) band leakages, and 16 (4.6%) band migrations-erosions. The most common reason for abdominal reoperation, band migration, was attributed to overfilling of the band system. In the patients in whom migration occurred, the bands had been filled with a mean volume of 12.6 ml fluid. In the remaining patients, the mean volume was 8.7 ml. The most common complication not requiring reoperation was reflux disease (4.7%). In cases with a small pouch, this complication did not seem to be a serious problem. The mean excess weight loss in the 296 patients without complications was 68%. The overall long-term complication rate following SAGB is reasonable. With improved operating technique and closer follow-up, it should be possible to reduce the complication rate further. Reoperation because of band migration appears to be related to overfilling of the system and should therefore be avoidable in most cases.",10.1381/096089299765553647,,,,676
890,Long-term hypovitaminosis D and secondary hyperparathyroidism outcomes of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a systematic review.,"Pre-operative Vitamin D deficiency is markedly prevalent in prospective bariatric surgery patients. While bariatric surgery leads to significant weight loss, it can exacerbate or prolong Vitamin D deficiency. We systematically reviewed the literature to assess whether secondary hyperparathyroidism is maintained in the medium to long term in patients following the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. A comprehensive literature search was conducted through Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Dare, Cochrane library and HTA database. The search terms used were bariatric surgery, gastric bypass and hyperparathyroidism. Fourteen studies were included (nÂ =Â 2688 subjects). Parathyroid hormone levels rose gradually from a mean pre-operative level of 5.69Â Â±Â 1.2Â pmol/L to 6.36Â Â±Â 0.77Â pmol/L, 7.59Â Â±Â 0.73Â pmol/L and 8.29Â Â±Â 1.41Â pmol/L at 2Â years, between 2 and 5Â years, and beyond 5Â years, respectively. Vitamin D levels slowly fell to a mean of 20.50Â Â±Â 4.37Â ng/mL and 20.76Â Â±Â 3.80Â ng/mL between follow-up intervals 2-5Â years and beyond 5, respectively. It appears that hyperparathyroidism persists at 5-year follow-up after gastric bypass, despite most patients being supplemented with calcium and Vitamin D.",10.1111/obr.12525,,,,677
130,Optimal Small Bowel Limb Lengths of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.,"Gastric bypass and biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) have come full circle, from a loop configuration to a Roux-en-Y and finally back to a loop configuration as one anastomosis gastric bypass and single-anastomosis duodenal switch. Most surgeons performing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) do not measure the common channel (CC) length and most surgeons performing BPD do not measure the biliopancreatic limb length (BPL). The small bowel length in humans is variable from as short asâ€‰<â€‰400Â cm to as long asâ€‰>â€‰1000Â cm. The combination of these two facts means that even if surgeons keep the limb lengths constant, surgeons will get variable limb length due to the variability of small bowel length in patients. Hence, outcomes of weight loss, resolution of medical problems, or developing nutritional deficiencies which are related to limb length are variable. In this article, we evaluate the published literature related to the effect of varying the Roux limb, BPL, CC, and total alimentary limb lengths on the outcomes of RYGB. We have focused on historical and current randomized controlled trials as well as systematic reviews and meta-analysis to outline the current literature and our interpretation of this literature.",10.1007/s13679-023-00513-4,,,,678
924,Vitamin D3 Loading Is Superior to Conventional Supplementation After Weight Loss Surgery in Vitamin D-Deficient Morbidly Obese Patients: a Double-Blind Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial.,"Bariatric patients often suffer from vitamin D deficiency (VDD), and both, morbid obesity and VDD, are related to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. However, limited data are available regarding best strategies for treating VDD, particularly, in bariatric patients undergoing omega-loop gastric bypass (OLGB). Therefore, we examined the efficacy and safety of a forced vitamin D dosing regimen and intervention effects in liver fibrotic patients. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 50 vitamin D-deficient patients undergoing OLGB were randomly assigned to receive, in the first month postoperatively, oral vitamin D3 (â‰¤3 doses of 100,000Â IU; intervention group) or placebo as loading dose (control group) with subsequent maintenance dose (3420Â IU/day) in both groups until 6-month visit. Compared with control group, higher increase of 25(OH)D (67.9 (21.1) vs. 55.7Â nmol/L (21.1); pÂ =Â 0.049) with lower prevalence of secondary hyperparathyroidism (10 vs. 24Â %; pÂ =Â 0.045) was observed in intervention group. No (serious) adverse events related to study medication were found. The loading dose regimen was more effective in increasing 25(OH)D in patients with significant liver fibrosis while this was not the case for conventional supplementation (placebo with maintenance dose) (71.5 (20.5) vs. 22.5Â nmol/L (13.8); pÂ =Â 0.022; nÂ =Â 14). Our findings indicate that a high vitamin D3 loading dose, in the first month postoperatively, with subsequent maintenance dose is effective and safe in achieving higher vitamin D concentrations in OLGB patients. Unexpectedly, it is more effective in patients with significant liver fibrosis which is of potentially high clinical relevance and requires further investigation.",10.1007/s11695-016-2437-0,,,,679
1219,[Effects of gastric bypass on estimated cardiovascular risk in morbidly obese patients with metabolic syndrome].,"The major goal of surgical treatment in morbid obesity is to decrease morbidity and mortality associated with excess weight. In this sense, the main factors of death are cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of gastric bypass on cardiovascular risk estimation in patients after bariatric surgery. We retrospectively evaluated pre and postoperative cardiovascular risk estimation of 402 morbidly obese patients who underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass. The major variable studied is the cardiovascular risk estimation that is calculated preoperatively and after 12 months. Cardiovascular risk estimation analysis has been performed with the REGICOR Equation. REGICOR formulation allows calculating a 10 year risk of cardiovascular events adapted to the Spanish population and is expressed in percentages. We reported an overall 4.1Â±3.0 mean basal REGICOR score. One year after the operation, cardiovascular risk estimation significantly decreased to 2,2Â±1,6 (P<.001). In patients with metabolic syndrome according to ATP-III criteria, basal REGICOR score was 4.8Â±3.1 whereas in no metabolic syndrome patients 2.2Â±1.8. Evaluation 12 months after surgery, determined a significant reduction in both groups (metabolic syndrome and non metabolic syndrome) with a mean REGICOR score of 2.3Â±1.6 and 1.6Â±1.0 respectively. The results of our study demonstrate favorable effects of gastric bypass on the cardiovascular risk factors included in the REGICOR equation.",10.1016/j.ciresp.2013.05.014,,,,680
1183,Upper gastrointestinal series after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity: effectiveness in leakage detection. a systematic review of the literature.,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the results of routine and selective postoperative upper gastrointestinal series (UGIS) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) for morbid obesity in different published series to assessing its utility and cost-effectiveness. A search in PubMed's MEDLINE was performed for English-spoken articles published from January 2002 to December 2012. Keywords used were upper GI series, RYGB, and obesity. Only cases of anastomotic leaks were considered. A total of 22 studies have been evaluated, 15 recommended a selective use of postoperative UGIS. No differences in leakage detection or in clinical benefit between routine and selective approaches were found. Tachycardia and respiratory distress represent the best criteria to perform UGIS for early diagnosis of anastomotic leak after a RYGB.",10.1007/s11695-014-1263-5,,,,681
1405,Noninvasive ventilation in the immediate postoperative of gastrojejunal derivation with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Morbidly obese patients develop more atelectasis during general anesthesia than non-obese ones, and these atelectasis persist for 24 hours after the end of the surgical procedure. This study evaluated the effect of noninvasive ventilation with two pressure levels (BiPAP) in the pulmonary function, incidence of immediate postoperative pulmonary complications and the development of anastomotic dehiscence in morbid obese patients submitted to gastrojejunal derivation in Roux-en-Y (RYGB). It was an analytical and clinical study involving patients who were submitted to RYGB, had a body mass index (BMI) of at least 35 kg/cmÂ², and were randomly chosen to receive BiPAP (experimental group) or standard oxygen therapy (control group), in the first four hours of the post-operation period. Patients with chronic or acute pulmonary disease were not included, and neither were the ones who needed invasive mechanical ventilation by the end of the surgery. Vital capacity, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure, and arterial blood gases were measured in the preoperative and in the first postoperative. Chest X-ray was performed in the third postoperative. Eighteen patients were chosen for the study: ten received BiPAP and eight received standard oxygen therapy. The study group had better partial oxygen pressure and lower maximal expiratory pressure levels in the postoperative state than the control group. Anastomotic dehiscence was not observed in any group. There was no significant difference between the control group and the study group relating to the loss of vital capacity, maximal inspiratory pressure in the postoperative period or the incidence of atelectasis. The BiPAP in the postoperative period of gastroplasty was useful to improve oxygenation and did not increase the incidence of anastomotic dehiscence.",,,,,682
410,Randomized clinical trial on closure versus non-closure of mesenteric defects during laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery.,"Internal herniation is a well known and potentially life-threatening complication of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefit and harm of closing the mesenteric defects with clips during LRYGB to prevent internal herniation. This was a single-centre, single-blinded RCT. Patients eligible for LRYGB were randomized to surgery with or without closure of mesenteric defects with clips. The primary endpoint was the incidence of (intermittent) internal herniation after LRYGB with a minimum follow-up of 24 months. Secondary outcomes were duration of surgery, number of clips used, trocars and sutures used, postoperative pain measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS), and postoperative complications. Between 13 August 2012 and 18 May 2017, 401 patients were randomized to closure (201) or non-closure (200) of mesenteric defects. Median follow-up for both groups was 59 months (range 8-67 and 16-67 months in non-closure and closure groups respectively). The cumulated risk of internal herniation after 2 years was 8.0 per cent in the non-closure group compared with 4.5 per cent in the closure group (hazard ratio (HR) 1.81, 95 per cent c.i. 0.80 to 4.12; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.231). At 5 years, rates were 15.5 and 6.5 per cent respectively (HR 2.52, 1.32 to 4.81; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.005). Closure of mesenteric defects increased operating time by a median of 4 min (95 per cent c.i. 52 to 56 min for the non-closure group and 56 to 60 min for the closure group; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.002). There was no difference in postoperative blood transfusion rates and VAS scores between the groups. Routine closure of the mesenteric defects in LRYGB with clips is associated with a lower rate of internal herniation.

1117,Mesenteric defect closure in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a randomized controlled trial.,"Internal herniation is a potential complication following laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). Previous studies have shown that closure of mesenteric defects after LRYGB may reduce the incidence of internal herniation. However, controversy remains as to whether mesenteric defect closure is necessary to decrease the incidence of internal hernias after LRYGB. This study aims to determine if jejeunal mesenteric defect closure reduces incidence of internal hernias and other complications in patients undergoing LRYGB. 105 patients undergoing laparoscopic antecolic RYGB were randomized into two groups: closed mesenteric defect (n = 50) or open mesenteric defect (n = 55). Complication rates were obtained from the medical record. Patients were followed up to 3 years post-operatively. Patients also completed the gastrointestinal quality of life index (GI QoL) pre-operatively and 12 months post-operatively. Outcome measures included: incidence of internal hernias, complications, readmissions, reoperations, GI QoL scores, and percent excess weight loss (%EWL). Pre-operatively, there were no significant differences between the two groups. The closed group had a longer operative time (closed-153 min, open-138 min, p = 0.073). There was one internal hernia in the open group. There was no significant difference at 12 months for decrease in BMI (closed-15.9, open-16.3 kg/m(2), p = 0.288) or %EWL (closed-75.3%, open-69.0%, p = 0.134). There was no significant difference between the groups in incidence of internal hernias and general complications post-operatively. Both groups showed significantly improved GI QoL index scores from baseline to 12 months post-surgery, but there were no significant differences at 12 months between groups in total GI QoL (closed-108, open-112, p = 0.440). In this study, closure or non-closure of the jejeunal mesenteric defect following LRYGB appears to result in equivalent internal hernia and complication rates. High index of suspicion should be maintained whenever internal hernia is expected after LRYGB.",10.1007/s00464-014-3970-3,,,,684
1120,Emergency endoscopy for gastrointestinal bleeding after bariatric surgery. Therapeutic algorithm.,"Gastrointestinal bleeding (GB) is a potential complication after bariatric surgery and its frequency is around 2-4% according to the literature. The aim of this study is to present our experience with GB after bariatric surgery, its presentation and possible treatment options by means of an algorithm. From January 2004 to December 2012, we performed 300 consecutive laparoscopic bariatric surgeries. A total of 280 patients underwent a laparoscopic Roux en Y gastric bypass with creation of a gastrojejunal anastomosis using a circular stapler type CEAA No 21 in 265 patients and with a linear stapler in 15 patients. Demographics, clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation and treatment were reviewed. A total of 20 patients underwent a sleeve gastrectomy. Twenty-seven cases (9%) developed GB. Diagnosis and therapeutic endoscopy was required in 13 patients. The onset of bleeding occurred between the 1(st)-6(th) postop days in 10 patients, and the origin was at the gastrojejunostomy staple-lines, and 3 patients had bleeding from an anastomotic ulcer 15-20 days after surgery. All other patients were managed non-operatively. Conservative management of gastrointestinal bleeding is effective in most cases, but endoscopy with therapeutic intent should be considered in patients with severe or recurrent bleeding. Multidisciplinary postoperative follow- up is very important for early detention and treatment of this complication.",10.1016/j.ciresp.2014.05.002,,,,685
348,Quality of Life After Bariatric Surgery-a Systematic Review with Bayesian Network Meta-analysis.,"Comprehensive analysis and comparison of HRQoL following different bariatric interventions through systematic review with network meta-analysis. Different types of bariatric surgeries have been developed throughout the years. Apart from weight loss and comorbidities remission, improvement of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important outcome of metabolic surgery. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus databases have been searched up to April 2020. Inclusion criteria to the analysis were (1) study with at least 2 arms comparing bariatric surgeries; (2) reporting of HRQoL with a validated tool; (3) follow-up period of 1, 2, 3, or 5Â years. Network meta-analysis was conducted using Bayesian statistics. The primary outcome was HRQoL. Forty-seven studies were included in the analysis involving 26,629 patients and 11 different surgeries such as sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), gastric bypass (LRYGB), one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB), and other. At 1Â year, there was significant difference in HRQoL in favor of LSG, LRYGB, and OAG compared with lifestyle intervention (SMD: 0.44; 95% CrI 0.2 to 0.68 for LSG, SMD: 0.56; 95% CrI 0.31 to 0.8 for LRYGB; and SMD: 0.43; 95% CrI 0.06 to 0.8 for OAGB). At 5Â years, LSG, LRYGB, and OAGB showed better HRQoL compared to control (SMD: 0.92; 95% CrI 0.58 to 1.26, SMD: 1.27; 95% CrI 0.94 to 1.61, and SMD: 1.01; 95% CrI 0.63 to 1.4, respectively). LSG and LRYGB may lead to better HRQoL across most follow-up time points. Long-term analysis shows that bariatric intervention results in better HRQoL than non-surgical interventions.",10.1007/s11695-021-05687-1,,,,686
466,"Potential Benefits and Harms of Gastric Bypass Surgery in Obese Individuals With Type 1 Diabetes: A Nationwide, Matched, Observational Cohort Study.","To study the potential long-term benefits and possible complications of bariatric surgery in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). In this register-based nationwide cohort study, we compared individuals with T1D and obesity who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery with patients with T1D and obesity matched for age, sex, BMI, and calendar time that did not undergo surgery. By linking the Swedish National Diabetes Register and Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry study individuals were included between 2007 and 2013. Outcomes examined included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, stroke, heart failure, and hospitalization for serious hypo- or hyperglycemic events, amputation, psychiatric disorders, changes in kidney function, and substance abuse. We identified 387 individuals who had undergone RYGB and 387 control patients. Follow-up for hospitalization was up to 9 years. Analysis showed lower risk for cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio [HR] 0.43; 95% CI 0.20-0.9), cardiovascular death (HR 0.15; 95% CI 0.03-0.68), hospitalization for heart failure (HR 0.32; 95% CI 0.15-0.67), and stroke (HR 0.18; 95% CI 0.04-0.82) for the RYGB group. There was a higher risk for serious hyperglycemic events (HR 1.99; 95% CI 1.07-3.72) and substance abuse (HR 3.71; 95% CI 1.03-3.29) after surgery. This observational study suggests bariatric surgery may yield similar benefits on risk for cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in patients with T1D and obesity as for patients with type 2 diabetes. However, some potential serious adverse effects suggest need for careful monitoring of such patients after surgery.",10.2337/dc20-0388,,,,687
429,The Effectiveness of Single-Anastomosis Duodenoileal Bypass with Sleeve Gastrectomy/One Anastomosis Duodenal Switch (SADI-S/OADS): an Updated Systematic Review.,"Single-anastomosis duodenoileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy/one anastomosis duodenal switch (SADI-S/OADS) was developed as a bariatric operation with reduced overall morbidity and lasting weight loss results. We performed a systematic review of the literature, including 14 studies reporting on weight loss, comorbidity resolution, postoperative complications, and nutritional deficiencies following SADI-S. Twelve months after SADI-S, the mean total body weight lost ranged from 21.5 to 41.2%, with no weight regain being observed after 24Â months. The comorbidity resolution rate was 72.6% for diabetes, 77.2% for dyslipidemia, and 59.0% for hypertension cases. The need for reoperation was the most common postoperative complication. While several patients developed nutrient deficiencies, SADI-S seems to be an overall safe and effective bariatric operation.",10.1007/s11695-020-05188-7,,,,688
143,Outcomes of Kidney Transplantation in Patients That Underwent Bariatric Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"The impact of bariatric surgery (BS) on kidney transplantation (KT) outcomes in patients with obesity remains controversial. We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies reporting outcomes of KT recipients that underwent prior BS. Common/random effects meta-analyses were performed to obtain summary ratios of the postoperative outcomes. Eighteen eligible studies involving 315 patients were identified. Sleeve gastrectomy was the most common BS type (65.7%) followed by Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (27.6%) and gastric banding (4.4%). Across studies that provided the data, the %excess weight loss from BS to KT was 62.79% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52.01-73.56; range, 46.2%-80.3%). The rates of delayed graft function and acute rejection were 16% (95% CI, 7%-28%) and 16% (95% CI, 11%-23%) in 14 and 11 studies that provided this data, respectively. The rates of wound, urinary, and vascular complications following KT were 5% (95% CI, 0%-13%),19% (95% CI, 2%-42%), and 2% (95% CI, 0%-5%), in 12, 9, and 11 studies that provided this data, respectively. Follow-up time after KT was reported in 11 studies (61.1%) and ranged from 16 mo to >5 y. Graft loss was reported in 14 studies with an average of 3% (95% CI, 1%-6%). Four studies that included a comparator group of patients with obesity who did not undergo BS before KT showed comparable outcomes between the groups. We conclude that currently there is a paucity of robust evidence to suggest that pretransplant BS has a major effect on post-KT outcomes. High-quality studies are needed to fully evaluate the impact of BS on KT outcomes.",10.1097/TP.0000000000004680,,,,689
332,Rate of post-bariatric hypoglycemia using continuous glucose monitoring: A meta-analysis of literature studies.,"Hypoglycemia is a serious complication of bariatric surgery. The aim of the present meta-analysis was to evaluate the rate and the timing of post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) with different bariatric procedures using reliable data from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Studies were systematically searched in the Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed databases according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The prevalence of PBH was expressed as weighted mean prevalence (WMP) with pertinent 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). A total of 8 studies (16 datasets) enrolling 280 bariatric subjects were identified. The total WMP of PBH was 54.3% (95%CI: 44.5%-63.8%) while the WMP of nocturnal PBH was 16.4% (95%CI: 7.0%-34%). We found a comparable rate of PBH after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) (OR 1.62, 95%CI: 0.71-3.7; PÂ =Â 0.248); likewise, the percent time spent in hypoglycemia was similar with the two procedures (mean difference 5.3%, 95%CI: -1.4%-12.0%; PÂ =Â 0.122); however, RYGB was characterized by a higher glycemic variability than SG. Regression models showed that the time elapsed from surgical intervention was positively associated with a higher rate of both total PBH (Z-value: 3.32, PÂ <Â 0.001) and nocturnal PBH (Z-value: 2.15, PÂ =Â 0.013). PBH, both post-prandial and nocturnal, is more prevalent than currently believed. The rate of PBH increases at increasing time from surgery and is comparable after RYGB and SG with a higher glucose variability after RYGB.",10.1016/j.numecd.2021.08.047,,,,690
1623,"Laparoscopic versus open gastric bypass: a randomized study of outcomes, quality of life, and costs.","To compare outcomes, quality of life (QOL), and costs of laparoscopic and open gastric bypass (GBP). Laparoscopic GBP has been reported to be a safe and effective approach for the treatment of morbid obesity. The authors performed a prospective randomized trial to compare outcomes, QOL, and costs of laparoscopic GBP with those of open GBP. From May 1999 to March 2001, 155 patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 to 60 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic (n = 79) or open (n = 76) GBP. The two groups were similar in age, sex ratio, mean BMI, and comorbidities. Main outcome measures included operative time, estimated blood loss, length of hospital stay, operative complications, percentage of excess body weight loss, and time to return to activities of daily living and work. Changes in QOL were assessed using the SF-36 Health Survey and the bariatric analysis of reporting outcome system (BAROS). Operative and hospital costs of the two operations were also compared. There were no deaths in either group. Mean operative time was longer for laparoscopic GBP than for open GBP, but operative blood loss was less. Two (2.5%) of the 79 patients in the laparoscopic group required conversion to laparotomy. Median length of hospital stay was shorter for laparoscopic GBP patients (3 vs 4 days). The rate of postoperative anastomotic leak was similar between groups. Wound-related complications such as infection (10.5 vs 1.3%) and incisional hernia (7.9 vs 0%) were more common after open GBP; late anastomotic stricture was less frequent after open GBP (2.6 vs 11.4%). Time to return to activities of daily living and work were shorter after laparoscopic GBP than after open GBP. Weight loss at 1 year was similar between groups. Preoperative SF-36 scores were similar between groups; however, at 1 month after surgery, laparoscopic patients had better physical conditioning, social functioning, general health, and less body pain than open GBP patients. At 6 months, the BAROS outcome was classified as good or better in 97% of laparoscopic GBP patients compared with 82% of open GBP patients. Operative costs were higher for laparoscopic GBP patients, but hospital costs were lower. Laparoscopic GBP is a safe and cost-effective alternative to open GBP. Despite a longer operative time, patients undergoing laparoscopic GBP benefited from less blood loss, a shorter hospital stay, and faster convalescence. Laparoscopic GBP patients had comparable weight loss at 1 year but a more rapid improvement in QOL than open GBP patients. The higher initial operative costs for laparoscopic GBP were adequately offset by the lower hospital costs.",10.1097/00000658-200109000-00002,,,,691
135,First-in-Human Side-to-Side Magnetic Compression Duodeno-ileostomy with the Magnet Anastomosis System.,"Classical gastrointestinal anastomoses are formed with sutures and/or metal staples, resulting in significant bleeding and leak rates. This study evaluated the feasibility and safety of the novel magnet anastomosis system (MS) to create a side-to-side duodeno-ileal (DI) diversion for weight loss and type 2 diabetes (T2D) resolution. Patients with severe obesity (body mass index (BMI)â€‰â‰¥â€‰35Â kg/m2 with/without T2D (HbA1Câ€‰â‰¥â€‰6.5%)) underwent the study procedure, a side-to-side MS DI diversion, with a standard sleeve gastrectomy (SG). A linear magnet was delivered by flexible endoscopy to a point 250Â cm proximal to the ileocecal valve; a second magnet was positioned in the first part of the duodenum; the bowel segments containing magnets were apposed, initiating gradual anastomosis formation. Laparoscopic assistance was used to obtain bowel measurements, obviate tissue interposition, and close mesenteric defects. Between November 22 and 26, 2021, 5 female patients (mean weight 117.6â€‰Â±â€‰7.1Â kg, BMI (kg/m2) 44.4â€‰Â±â€‰2.2) underwent side-to-side MS DIâ€‰+â€‰SG. All magnets were successfully placed, expelled without re-intervention, and formed patent durable anastomoses. Total weight loss at 12Â months was 34.0â€‰Â±â€‰1.4% (SEM); excess weight loss, 80.2â€‰Â±â€‰6.6%; and BMI reduction, 15.1. Mean HbA1C (%) dropped from 6.8â€‰Â±â€‰0.8 to 4.8â€‰Â±â€‰0.2; and glucose (mg/dL), from 134.3â€‰Â±â€‰17.9 to 87.3â€‰Â±â€‰6.3 (mean reduction, 47.0Â mg/dL). There was no anastomotic bleeding, leakage, obstruction, or infection and no mortality. Creation of a side-to-side magnetic compression anastomosis to achieve duodeno-ileostomy diversion in adults with severe obesity was feasible and safe, achieved excellent weight loss, and resolved type 2 diabetes at 1-year follow-up.

299,Sleeve gastrectomy as a surgical technique in bariatric surgery: Results of safety and effectiveness.,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness results of sleeve gastrectomy as a bariatric technique. Observational follow-up study of a cohort of patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy in our center between 2008 and 2017. A total of 223 patients were included: 166 as a primary technique (group 1) and 57 as a hypothetical first stage (group 2). In group 1, the postoperative morbidity is 12.6%, with a fistula rate of 4.2%; 5.4% required reoperation and mortality was 0.6%. In group 2, postoperative morbidity is 14%, with a fistula rate of 5.3%; 10.5% required reoperation and mortality was 5.3%. In group 1, 79.6% and 62.5% of patients at 2 and 5 years respectively managed to achieve a % EBMILÂ >Â 50%. In group 2, the second stage was completed only in 8 patients (14.0%). Of the patients who did not complete the second stage, 32.2% and 5.9% achieved a % EEBMILÂ >Â 100% at 2 and 5 years. Analyzing those who completed the second stage, the mean EEBMIL% was 90.5% and 93.4% at 2 and 5 years. Sleeve gastrectomy is a safe technique in patients with BMIÂ <Â 45 and effective in terms of weight loss in the short-medium term. In patients with BMIÂ >Â 55, a preoperative optimization aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality is necessary, as well as adequately planning the second stage, without which it is clearly insufficient.",10.1016/j.cireng.2022.01.002,,,,693
1365,Roux-en-Y gastric bypass corrects hyperinsulinemia implications for the remission of type 2 diabetes.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has been shown to induce rapid and durable reversal of type 2 diabetes. The aim of the study was to investigate a possible mechanism for the remission of type 2 diabetes after RYGB. A cross-sectional, nonrandomized, controlled study was conducted. Surgery patients were studied before RYGB and 1 wk and 3 months after surgery. This study was conducted at East Carolina University. Subjects were recruited into three groups: 1) lean controls with no surgery [body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/mÂ²; n = 9], 2) severely obese type 2 diabetic patients (BMI > 35 kg/mÂ²; n = 9), and 3) severely obese nondiabetic patients (BMI > 35 kg/mÂ²; n = 9). Intervention was RYGB. One week after RYGB, diabetes was resolved despite continued insulin resistance (insulin sensitivity index was approximately 50% of lean controls) and reduced insulin secretion during an iv glucose tolerance test (acute insulin response to glucose was approximately 50% of lean controls). Fasting insulin decreased and was no different from lean control despite continued elevated glucose in the type 2 diabetic patients compared with lean. After RYGB, fasting insulin decreases to levels like those of lean control subjects and diabetes is reversed (fasting blood glucose < 125 mg/dl). This leads us to propose that 1) exclusion of food from the foregut corrects hyperinsulinemia and 2) fasting insulin is dissociated from the influence of fasting glucose, insulin resistance, and BMI. The mechanisms for reversal of diabetes in the face of reduced insulin remain a paradox.",10.1210/jc.2011-0165,,,,694
1541,"Open versus laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a comparative study of over 25,000 open cases and the major laparoscopic bariatric reported series.","Laparoscopic bariatric surgery has experienced a rapid expansion of interest over the past 5 years, with a 470% increase. This rapid expansion has markedly increased overall cost, reducing surgical access. Many surgeons believe that the traditional open approach is a cheaper, safer, equally effective alternative. 16 highly experienced ""open"" bariatric surgeons with a combined total of 25,759 cases representing >200 surgeon years of experience, pooled their open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (ORYGBP) data, and compared their results to the leading laparoscopic (LRYGBP) papers in the literature. In the overall series, the incisional hernia rate was 6.4% using the standard midline incision. Utilizing the left subcostal incision (LSI), it was only 0.3%. Return to surgery in <30 days was 0.7%, deaths 0.25%, and leaks 0.4%. Average length of stay was 3.4 days, and return to usual activity 21 days. Small bowel obstruction was significantly higher with the LRYGBP. Surgical equipment costs averaged approximately $3,000 less for ""open"" cases. LRYGBP had an added expense for longer operative time. This more than made up for the shorter length of stay with the laparoscopic approach. The higher cost, higher leak rate, higher rate of small bowel obstruction, and similar long-term weight loss results make the ""open"" RYGBP our preferred operation. If the incision is taken out of the equation (i.e. use of the LSI), the significant advantages of the open technique become even more obvious.",10.1381/096089206777346628,,,,695
1261,Ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block for laparoscopic gastric-bypass surgery: a prospective randomized controlled double-blinded trial.,"Despite the laparoscopic approach, patients can suffer moderate to severe pain following bariatric surgery. This randomized controlled double-blinded trial investigated the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks for laparoscopic gastric-bypass surgery. Seventy patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric-bypass surgery were randomized to receive either bilateral ultrasound-guided subcostal TAP block injections after induction of general anesthesia or none. All patients received trocar insertion site local anesthetic infiltration and systemic analgesia. The primary outcome was cumulative opioid consumption (IV morphine equivalent) during the first 24Â h postoperatively. Interval opioid consumption, pain severity scores, rates of nausea or vomiting, and rates of pruritus were measured during phase I recovery, and at 24 and 48Â h postoperatively. There was no difference in cumulative opioid consumption during the first 24Â h postoperatively between the TAP (32.2Â mg [95% CI, 27.6-36.7]) and control (35.6Â mg [95% CI, 28.6-42.5]; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.41) groups. Postoperative opioid consumptions during phase I recovery and the 24-48-h interval were similar between groups, as were pain scores at rest and with movement during all measured intervals. The rates of nausea or vomiting and pruritus were equivalent. Bilateral TAP blocks do not provide additional analgesic benefit when added to trocar insertion site local anesthetic infiltration and systemic analgesia for laparoscopic gastric-bypass surgery.",10.1007/s11695-013-0958-3,,,,696
145,A study analyzing outcomes after bariatric surgery by primary language.,"Communication is key to success in bariatric surgery. This study aims to understand how outcomes after bariatric surgery differ between patients with a non-English primary language and those with English as their primary language. This retrospective, observational cohort study of bariatric surgery patients ageâ€‰â‰¥â€‰18Â years utilized the Michigan, Maryland, and New Jersey State Inpatient Databases and State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Databases, 2016 to 2018. Patients were classified by primary spoken language: English and non-English. Primary outcome was complications. Secondary outcomes included length of stay (LOS) and cost, with cost calculated using cost-to-charge ratios provided by Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project and reported in 2019 United States dollars. Multivariable regression models (logistic, Poisson, and quantile) were used to examine associations between primary language and outcomes. Given the uneven distribution of race by primary language, interaction terms were used to examine conditional effects of race. Among 69,749 bariatric surgery patients, 2811 (4.2%) spoke a non-English primary language. Covariates, notably race distribution, and unadjusted outcomes differed significantly by primary language. However, after adjustment, non-English primary language was not associated with significantly increased odds of complications (odds ratio 1.24, pâ€‰=â€‰0.389), significantly different LOS (-Â 0.02Â days, pâ€‰=â€‰0.677), nor significantly different mean healthcare costs (-Â $265, pâ€‰=â€‰0.309). There were no significant conditional effects of race seen among outcomes. Though non-English primary language was associated with a significantly different distribution of observable characteristics (including race, income quartile, and insurance type), after adjustment, non-English primary language was not associated with significant differential risk of adverse outcomes after bariatric surgery, and there were no significant conditional effects of race. As such, this study suggests that disparities in bariatric surgery by primary spoken language more likely related to access to care, or the pre- and post-hospital care continuum, rather than index hospitalization after surgery.",10.1007/s00464-023-10127-5,,,,697
92,"PROMISE: effect of protein supplementation on fat-free mass preservation after bariatric surgery, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.","Protein malnutrition after bariatric surgery is a severe complication and leads to significant morbidity. Previous studies have shown that protein intake and physical activity are the most important factors in the preservation of fat-free mass during weight loss. Low protein intake is very common in patients undergoing bariatric surgery despite dietary counseling. Protein powder supplements might help patients to achieve the protein intake recommendations after bariatric surgery and could therefore contribute to preserve fat-free mass. This double-blind randomized placebo-controlled intervention study aims to assess the effect of a daily consumed clear protein powder shake during the first 6Â months after bariatric surgery on fat-free mass loss in the first 12Â months after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). Inclusion will take place at the outpatient clinic of the bariatric expertise center for obesity of the Maasstad Hospital. Patients will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group before surgery. The intervention group will receive a clear protein powder shake of 200Â ml containing 20Â g of whey protein dissolved in water which should be taken daily during the first 6Â months after LRYGB on top of their normal postoperative diet. The control group will receive an isocaloric, clear, placebo shake containing maltodextrine. Postoperative rehabilitation and physiotherapeutical guidance will be standardized and similar in both groups. Also, both groups will receive the same dietary advice from specialized dieticians. The main study parameter is the percentage of fat-free mass loss 6Â months after surgery, assessed by multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (MF-BIA). The protocol, version 2 (February 20, 2022) has been approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committees United (MEC-U) (NL 80414.100.22).

Randomized controlled trials comparing at least two surgical interventions (of gastric bypass, gastric band, and sleeve gastrectomy) for severe and complex obesity were examined using the PRagmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary-2 tool, to consider how applicable the trial results are to clinical practice, and the Risk of Bias 2 tool, to examine validity. MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL databases were searched for studies published between November 2013 and June 2021, and 15 were identified. Using the PRagmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary-2 tool, three were classified as pragmatic, with good applicability to clinical practice. Ten had more explanatory domains but did include some pragmatic characteristics, and two were predominantly explanatory. This was due to some trial design features that would not be considered applicable to the wider clinical setting, including being single-centered, having prescribed intervention delivery methods, and intensive follow-up regimens. Only two trials had low risk of bias, of which one was considered pragmatic. Three had high risk of bias. Overall, few trials in bariatric surgery are pragmatic with low risk of bias. Well-designed pragmatic trials are needed to inform practice and reduce research waste.",10.1111/obr.13718,,,,699

Integrated assessment of neuroendocrine and metabolic changes over time in T2D patients undergoing RYGB. Follow-up of single-center randomized study. Thirteen patients with obesity and T2D compared to 22 healthy subjects. Blood chemistry, adipose biopsies, and heart rate variability were obtained before and 4, 24, and 104 weeks post-RYGB. After RYGB, glucose-lowering drugs were discontinued and hemoglobin A1c fell from mean 55 to 41 mmol/mol by 104 weeks (Pâ€…<â€…0.001). At 4 weeks, morning cortisol (Pâ€…<â€…0.05) and adrenocorticotropin (Pâ€…=â€…0.09) were reduced by 20%. Parasympathetic nerve activity (heart rate variability derived) increased at 4 weeks (Pâ€…<â€…0.05) and peaked at 24 weeks (Pâ€…<â€…0.01). C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cells were rapidly reduced (Pâ€…<â€…0.01). At 104 weeks, basal and insulin-stimulated adipocyte glucose uptake increased by 3-fold vs baseline and expression of genes involved in glucose transport, fatty acid oxidation, and adipogenesis was upregulated (Pâ€…<â€…0.01). Adipocyte volume was reduced by 4 weeks and more markedly at 104 weeks, by about 40% vs baseline (Pâ€…<â€…0.01). We propose this order of events: (1) rapid glucose lowering (days); (2) attenuated cortisol axis activity and inflammation and increased parasympathetic tone (weeks); and (3) body fat and weight loss, increased adipose glucose uptake, and whole-body insulin sensitivity (months-years; similar to healthy controls).

1477,A prospective randomized study comparing patients with morbid obesity submitted to laparotomic gastric bypass with or without omentectomy.,"Visceral fat, especially the greater omentum, seems to be an important factor in the development of some metabolic disturbances such as insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia. Therefore, we wanted to evaluate the influence of resecting or leaving in situ the greater omentum in a group of patients with morbid obesity. Seventy patients with morbid obesity were submitted to laparotomic resectional gastric bypass and an omentectomy was randomly performed in some patients. Body mass index (BMI), serum levels of sugar, insulin, total cholesterol, and triglycerides were determined prior to surgery and followed up on for 2 years afterwards. Two years after surgery, no differences were seen in BMI levels in either group. Blood sugar levels, serum insulin, total cholesterol levels, and serum triglycerides had similar values in both groups. Arterial hypertension had similar behavior. Based on these results, omentectomy is not justified as part of bariatric surgery. Its theoretical advantages are not reflected in this prospective random trial.",10.1007/s11695-008-9660-2,,,,705

1033,Metabolomic fingerprint of severe obesity is dynamically affected by bariatric surgery in a procedure-dependent manner.,"Obesity is associated with multiple diseases. Bariatric surgery is the most effective therapy for severe obesity that can reduce body weight and obesity-associated morbidity. The metabolic alterations associated with obesity and respective changes after bariatric surgery are incompletely understood. We comprehensively assessed metabolic alterations associated with severe obesity and distinct bariatric procedures. In our longitudinal observational study, we applied a (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance-based global, untargeted metabolomics strategy on human serum samples that were collected before and repeatedly â‰¤1 y after distinct bariatric procedures [i.e., a sleeve gastrectomy, proximal Roux-en Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and distal RYGB]. For comparison, we also analyzed serum samples from normal-weight and less-obese subjects who were matched for 1-y postoperative body mass index (BMI) values of the surgical groups. We identified a metabolomic fingerprint in obese subjects that was clearly discriminated from that of normal-weight subjects. Furthermore, we showed that bariatric surgery (sleeve gastrectomy and proximal and distal RYGB) dynamically affected this fingerprint in a procedure-dependent manner, thereby establishing new fingerprints that could be discriminated from those of BMI-matched and normal-weight control subjects. Metabolites that largely contributed to the metabolomic fingerprints of severe obesity were aromatic and branched-chain amino acids (elevated), metabolites related to energy metabolism (pyruvate and citrate; elevated), and metabolites suggested to be derived from gut microbiota (formate, methanol, and isopropanol; all elevated). Our data indicate that bariatric surgery, irrespective of the specific kind of procedure used, reverses most of the metabolic alterations associated with obesity and suggest profound changes in gut microbiome-host interactions after the surgery.

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Obesity increases the risk of pelvic floor disorders in individuals with obesity, including faecal incontinence. Faecal incontinence (FI) is a condition with important clinical and psychosocial consequences. Though it is associated with obesity, the effect of bariatric surgery on the prevalence and severity of FI is not well reported. To assess the effect of bariatric surgery on the prevalence and severity of FI in adult patients with obesity. This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA statement. Two independent reviewers performed a literature search in MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane and Embase from 1 January 1980 to 12 January 2019. We included published English-language randomized control trials and observational studies assessing pre- and post-bariatric surgery prevalence or severity of FI. Random-effects models with DerSimonian and Laird's variance estimator were used for meta-analysis. Thirteen studies were included, eight assessing prevalence (678 patients) and 11 assessing severity of FI (992 patients). There was no significant difference in prevalence post-operatively overall, though it trended towards a reduction [pooled OR=0.55; =0.075]. There was a significant reduction of FI prevalence in women post-bariatric surgery [95% CI 0.22 to 0.94, p=0.034]. There was a statistically significant reduction in FI prevalence following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and one anastomosis gastric bypass [0.46, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.81; p=0.007]. There was no significant reduction of incontinence episodes post-operatively [pooled mean difference =-0.17, 95% CI -0.90 to 0.56; p=0.65]. Quality of life (QOL) was not significantly improved post-bariatric surgery [mean differences for the following facets of QOL: behaviour -0.35, 95% CI -0.94 to 0.24; depression 0.04, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.2; lifestyle -0.33, 95% CI -0.98 to 0.33; p values of 0.25, 0.61 and 0.33, respectively]. There was a significant reduction in FI prevalence in women and those who underwent Roux-en-Y or one anastomosis gastric bypass.

408,Comparison of the incidence of cholelithiasis after sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a meta-analysis.,"Bariatric surgery could increase the risk of cholelithiasis, although it is unclear whether the incidence rates of cholelithiasis are similar after different bariatric procedures. To compare the incidence rates of cholelithiasis after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in people with obesity. Meta-analysis of cohort studies. We searched the PubMed and Web of Science databases for relevant studies before December 2020, and estimated the summary odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random-effects model or fixed-effects model, according to the heterogeneity. In total, 8 cohort studies were included in this meta-analysis, and 94,855 and 106,844 participants received SG and RYGB, respectively. Compared with those receiving RYGB, the summary results showed that participants receiving SG had a 35% lower rate of cholelithiasis (OR, .65; 95% CI, .49-.86). Also, the participants receiving SG had a significantly lower incidence of cholecystectomy than those receiving RYGB (OR, .54; 95% CI, .30-.99). In a subgroup analysis, SG was associated with a significantly lower incidence of subsequent cholelithiasis than RYGB in both Western and non-Western countries. SG led to a significantly lower incidence of cholelithiasis than RYGB only when the follow-up was <2 years instead of over 2 years. Participants receiving SG had a significantly lower incidence of cholelithiasis than those receiving RYGB, particularly within the first 2 years after the bariatric surgery.",10.1016/j.soard.2021.02.003,,,,709
1101,Two-year changes in bone density after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.,"Bariatric surgery is increasingly popular but may lead to metabolic bone disease. The objective was to determine the rate of bone loss in the 24 months after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This was a prospective cohort study conducted at an academic medical center. The participants were adults with severe obesity, including 30 adults undergoing gastric bypass and 20 nonsurgical controls. We measured bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine and proximal femur by quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at 0, 12, and 24 months. BMD and bone microarchitecture were also assessed by high-resolution peripheral QCT, and estimated bone strength was calculated using microfinite element analysis. Weight loss plateaued 6 months after gastric bypass but remained greater than controls at 24 months (-37 Â± 3 vs -5 Â± 3 kg [ mean Â± SEM]; P < .001). At 24 months, BMD was 5-7% lower at the spine and 6-10% lower at the hip in subjects who underwent gastric bypass compared with nonsurgical controls, as assessed by QCT and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (P < .001 for all). Despite significant bone loss, average T-scores remained in the normal range 24 months after gastric bypass. Cortical and trabecular BMD and microarchitecture at the distal radius and tibia deteriorated in the gastric bypass group throughout the 24 months, such that estimated bone strength was 9% lower than controls. The decline in BMD persisted beyond the first year, with rates of bone loss exceeding controls throughout the second year at all skeletal sites. Mean serum calcium, 25(OH)-vitamin D, and PTH were maintained within the normal range in both groups. Substantial bone loss occurs throughout the 24 months after gastric bypass despite weight stability in the second year. Although the benefits of gastric bypass surgery are well established, the potential for adverse effects on skeletal integrity remains an important concern.",10.1210/jc.2014-4341,,,,710
308,Esophageal and gastric malignancies after bariatric surgery: a retrospective global study.,"Bariatric surgery can influence the presentation, diagnosis, and management of gastrointestinal cancers. Esophagogastric (EG) malignancies in patients who have had a prior bariatric procedure have not been fully characterized. To characterize EG malignancies after bariatric procedures. University Hospital, United Kingdom. We performed a retrospective, multicenter observational study of patients with EG malignancies after bariatric surgery to characterize this condition. This study includes 170 patients from 75 centers in 25 countries who underwent bariatric procedures between 1985 and 2020. At the time of the bariatric procedure, the mean age was 50.2 Â± 10 years, and the mean weight 128.8 Â± 28.9 kg. Women composed 57.3% (n = 98) of the population. Most (n = 64) patients underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) followed by adjustable gastric band (AGB; n = 46) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG; n = 43). Time to cancer diagnosis after bariatric surgery was 9.5 Â± 7.4 years, and mean weight at diagnosis was 87.4 Â± 21.9 kg. The time lag was 5.9 Â± 4.1 years after SG compared to 9.4 Â± 7.1 years after RYGB and 10.5 Â± 5.7 years after AGB. One third of patients presented with metastatic disease. The majority of tumors were adenocarcinoma (82.9%). Approximately 1 in 5 patients underwent palliative treatment from the outset. Time from diagnosis to mortality was under 1 year for most patients who died over the intervening period. The Oesophago-Gastric Malignancies After Obesity/Bariatric Surgery study presents the largest series to date of patients developing EG malignancies after bariatric surgery and attempts to characterize this condition.",10.1016/j.soard.2021.11.024,,,,711
613,Changes in Bone Metabolism After Sleeve Gastrectomy Versus Gastric Bypass: a Meta-Analysis.,"Gastric bypass (GB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are two common types of bariatric surgery that carry many potential complications. Among these complications, bone metabolism-related diseases have attracted substantial attention; however, no meta-analysis of them has been performed to date. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, and Embase to identify relevant studies published before January 2019. The following indicators were evaluated: serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, phosphorus and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, body mass index (BMI), and bone mineral density (BMD). Thirteen studies met our inclusion criteria. Overall results showed that patients undergoing GB had lower levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (MDâ€‰=â€‰-â€‰1.85, 95% CI (-â€‰3.32, -â€‰0.39) Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01) and calcium (MDâ€‰=â€‰-â€‰0.15, 95% CI (-â€‰0.24, -â€‰0.07) Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0006) as well as higher levels of PTH (MDâ€‰=â€‰3.58, 95% CI (0.61, 7.09) Pâ€‰=â€‰0.02) and phosphorus (MDâ€‰=â€‰0.22, 95% CI (0.10, 0.35) Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0005). The results of BMI and BMD were comparable in each group. Our meta-analysis suggested that obese patients undergoing GB had lower levels of serum calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D as well as higher levels of serum phosphorus and PTH. To prevent postoperative bone metabolism-related diseases, appropriate postoperative interventions should be undertaken for particular surgical procedures.",10.1007/s11695-019-04119-5,,,,712
1151,Lifestyle management for enhancing outcomes after bariatric surgery.,"Bariatric surgery has been safe and effective for treatment of severe obesity and comorbidities like type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Nonetheless, weight loss and health outcomes vary considerably across individuals. Although the factors associated with outcomes are not fully understood, postoperative weight loss following any type of bariatric surgery is largely dependent on the extent to which patients can make and sustain changes in eating and activity. Therefore, lifestyle management including diet, exercise, and behavior modification is critical to helping patients achieve long-term weight loss. Pharmacotherapy and reoperation may also play a role after bariatric surgery. In this article, we highlight recent research findings in all of these areas to provide suggestions for how to enhance outcomes following bariatric surgery. Research on the mechanisms for weight loss and improvements in T2D following the different surgical procedures is needed to support the development of more personalized approaches to the multidisciplinary management of severe obesity.",10.1007/s11892-014-0540-y,,,,713
1141,"Ileal food diversion: a simple, powerful and easily revisable and reversible single-anastomosis gastric bypass.","Malabsorptive interventions are recognized as procedure of choice in metabolic surgery and the best strategy for re-do surgery when restriction failed. We describe a novel procedure, the ileal food diversion, an easy and effective non-restrictive one-anastomosis gastric bypass. We report the preliminary results of a series of 68 consecutive patients performed by two surgeons in two different hospitals since 2009 (49 females, 13 re-do surgeries). Mean operating time was 65 min. All operations were performed by laparoscopy (three-trocar technique in 44 cases and 24 single-incision laparoscopies). Median follow-up is 9.6 months (range 2-48). Diabetes resolution was accomplished in 80% of patients. Average BMI decreases from 44 to 27 after 24 months. Ileal food diversion is an interesting option in super-obese patients, re-do surgery and patients with metabolic syndrome. Technical considerations, physiological assumptions and rationale were discussed.",10.1007/s11695-014-1436-2,,,,714
1572,"Laparoscopic gastric banding: a prospective, randomized study comparing the Lapband and the SAGB: early results.","The objective of this study was to evaluate the results of laparoscopic gastric banding using 2 different bands (the Lapband [Bioenterics, Carpinteria, CA] and the SAGB [Swedish Adjustable Gastric Band; Obtech Medical, 6310 Zug, Switzerland]) in terms of weight loss and correction of comorbidities, short-and long-term complications, and improvement of quality of life in morbidly obese patients During the past 10 years, gastric banding has become 1 of the most common bariatric procedures, at least in Europe and Australia. Weight loss can be excellent, but it is not sufficient in a significant proportion of patients, and a number of long-term complications can develop. We hypothesized that the type of band could be of importance in the outcome. One hundred eighty morbidly obese patients were randomly assigned to receive the Lapband or the SAGB. All the procedures were performed by the same surgeon. The primary end point was weight loss, and secondary end points were correction of comorbidities, early- and long-term complications, importance of food restriction, and improvement of quality of life. Initial weight loss was faster in the Lapband group, but weight loss was eventually identical in the 2 groups. There was a trend toward more early band-related complications and more band infections with the SAGB, but the study had limited power in that respect. Correction of comorbidities, food restriction, long-term complications, and improvement of quality of life were identical. Only 55% to 60% of the patients achieved an excess weight loss of at least 50% in both groups. There was no difference in the incidence of long-term complications. Gastric banding can be performed safely with the Lapband or the SAGB with similar short- and midterm results with respect to weight loss and morbidity. Only 50% to 60% of the patients will achieve sufficient weight loss, and close to 10% at least will develop severe long-term complications.",10.1097/01.sla.0000150071.86934.36,,,,715
777,Totally endoscopic implant to effect a gastric bypass: 12-month safety and efficacy outcomes.,"Only a small percentage of candidates for bariatric surgery ever undergo a procedure for weight loss. Devices duplicating key effects of bariatric surgeries with removable, fully trans-oral implants could extend their benefits to patients unwilling to undergo anatomy-altering abdominal surgeries. Thirty-two obese subjects (mean BMI: 42.3) were enrolled in a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, feasibility trial of the first fully trans-oral endoscopic gastrointestinal bypass device. The device is a cuff attached to the distal esophagus by transmural anchors and connected to a 120-cm sleeve diverting undigested nutrients to the jejunum. Bodyweight, vital signs, adverse events, medications, HbA1c, fasting glucose, and lipids were collected at baseline and follow-up visits. Device status was endoscopically assessed every 6 months. The fully trans-oral procedure was successful in all subjects without intraoperative adverse events or postoperative infections. Twenty-eight of 32 subjects (88%) remained implanted with continuing follow-up beyond their 12-month visit. At 12 months, the 32 subjects had lost an average of 44.8% of excess body weight, 17.6% of total body weight, 20.8Â kg, and 7.5 BMI points. Weight loss depended on capture of ingesta by the esophageal cuff, with 18 of 32 subjects without visible gaps around their cuffs at the 6 month endoscopy having significantly greater EWL (53.6 vs. 33.4% in the remaining subjects, pâ€‰<â€‰0.002). Mean HbA1c and fasting glucose declined by 1.1% points and 29Â mg/dL in type 2 diabetic subjects, 80% of whom had remission of their diabetes at 12 months. This study demonstrates the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a fully trans-oral gastrointestinal bypass implant. This purely endoscopic device may provide a valuable addition to the armamentarium of treatment available for the management of morbid obesity.",10.1007/s00464-018-6186-0,,,,716
1409,Effect of staple height on gastrojejunostomy during laparoscopic gastric bypass: a multicenter prospective randomized trial.,"Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and anastomotic stricture are frequent complications associated with the construction of the gastrojejunostomy during laparoscopic gastric bypass. Staplers with shorter staple height can reduce the rate of postoperative GI hemorrhage. The aim of the present study was to assess the outcomes of patients who had undergone gastric bypass with construction of the gastrojejunostomy using a 25-mm circular stapler with a 3.5- versus 4.8-mm staple height. From January 2007 to February 2009, 357 patients underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass using a circular stapler for construction of the gastrojejunostomy were randomly assigned to either the 3.5-mm (n = 180) or 4.8-mm (n = 177) group. Two patients randomized to the 4.8-mm group did not undergo the operative procedure and were excluded from the analysis. The primary outcome measures included the rate of GI hemorrhage, anastomotic stricture, and wound infection. The 2 groups were similar with regard to the demographics and baseline body mass index (47 versus 48 kg/m(2)). The operative time, blood loss, and postoperative hematocrit on day 2 were similar between the 2 groups. No significant differences were seen in the overall rate of intraoperative GI bleeding or postoperative GI bleeding from all sources (3.3% for 3.5 mm versus 6.3% for 4.8 mm, P >.05); however, a trend was seen toward a lower rate of postoperative GI bleeding from the gastric pouch or gastrojejunostomy (.5% for 3.5 mm versus 3.4% for 4.8 mm, P = .06). The rate of anastomotic stricture was significantly lower in the 3.5-mm group (3.9% versus 16.0%, P <.01). No significant differences were seen in rate of wound infection between the 2 groups. Other morbidities for the entire study cohort included leaks (1.1%), pulmonary embolism (.6%), gastrointestinal obstruction (1.4%), and reoperation (3.4%). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was .3%, and the 30-day mortality rate was .8%. In the present prospective, randomized trial, using a circular stapler with a shorter staple height (3.5 mm) during construction of the gastrojejunostomy, significantly reduced the rate of postoperative anastomotic stricture, with a trend toward a lower rate of GI bleeding from the gastrojejunostomy.",10.1016/j.soard.2010.03.294,,,,717
1108,Remission of type 2 diabetes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy is associated with a distinct glycemic profile.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) have been associated with a high remission rate of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, whether such remission is associated with full restoration of postprandial glucose profile and/or the potentially nonrestored glycemic profile is associated with altered beta cell function, and relapse of T2DM over time is unknown. Cross-sectional studies comparing (1) glucose and proinsulin/insulin response to a standardized liquid mixed meal (SLMM) challenge (n = 31), (2) glucose response in normal living conditions assessed using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) (n = 16), and prospective observational study comparing (3) rates of relapse of T2DM after surgery (n = 232) in subjects with remission of T2DM ensuing RYGBP or SG. In RYGB individuals, SLMM elicited faster and sharper rise in plasma glucose compared with SG, with 88.2% and 42.9% of the study subjects presenting respectively a peak glucose more than 180 mg/dL (all, P < 0.05). During CGM, average percent time in hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic range was larger in RYGBP (respectively, 4.6% and 12.7%) compared with SG subjects (respectively, 0.4% and 3.2%; both P < 0.05). However, (1) no differences were found in fasting or stimulated proinsulin/insulin ratio, and (2) higher rates of T2DM relapse were observed after SG (hazard ratio: 2.339; P = 0.034). Remission of T2DM after RYGBP and SG is associated with distinct glycemic profiles. However, longer time spent in hyperglycemia and in hypoglycemia after RYGBP compared with SG is not associated with persistence of altered beta cell function or higher rates of relapse of T2DM over time.",10.1097/SLA.0000000000000586,,,,718
1259,A meta-analysis: to compare the clinical results between gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy for the obese patients.,"We attempted to compare the effects of two kinds of surgery for obesity: laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). We performed an electronic literature search of published articles relating to obesity surgery since inception to July 2012, in which LGB was compared with LSG for patients with a body mass index (BMI) >30, and eight studies were finally selected. We recorded a benefit of LGB on the change of BMI (OR = 1.84, 95 % CI = 0.50-3.18). Besides, we found that the homeostasis model assessment was lower after LGB than LSG (OR = -0.83, 95 % CI = -1.43 to -0.22), the total cholesterol was also lower (OR = -17.43, 95 % CI = -34.72 to -0.14), and the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was higher in the LGB group (OR = 3.27, 95 % CI = 0.48-6.06). Based on these findings, LGB could have a better effect compared with LSG.",10.1007/s11695-013-0938-7,,,,719
453,The Effect of Standard Versus Longer Intestinal Bypass on GLP-1 Regulation and Glucose Metabolism in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Undergoing Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: The Long-Limb Study.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) characteristically enhances postprandial levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a mechanism that contributes to its profound glucose-lowering effects. This enhancement is thought to be triggered by bypass of food to the distal small intestine with higher densities of neuroendocrine L-cells. We hypothesized that if this is the predominant mechanism behind the enhanced secretion of GLP-1, a longer intestinal bypass would potentiate the postprandial peak in GLP-1, translating into higher insulin secretion and, thus, additional improvements in glucose tolerance. To investigate this, we conducted a mechanistic study comparing two variants of RYGB that differ in the length of intestinal bypass. A total of 53 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity were randomized to either standard limb RYGB (50-cm biliopancreatic limb) or long limb RYGB (150-cm biliopancreatic limb). They underwent measurements of GLP-1 and insulin secretion following a mixed meal and insulin sensitivity using euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps at baseline and 2 weeks and at 20% weight loss after surgery. Both groups exhibited enhancement in postprandial GLP-1 secretion and improvements in glycemia compared with baseline. There were no significant differences in postprandial peak concentrations of GLP-1, time to peak, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity. The findings of this study demonstrate that lengthening of the intestinal bypass in RYGB does not affect GLP-1 secretion. Thus, the characteristic enhancement of GLP-1 response after RYGB might not depend on delivery of nutrients to more distal intestinal segments.",10.2337/dc20-0762,,,,720
1126,Effect of Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery on Obstructive Sleep Apnea in a Chinese Population with Obesity and T2DM.,"Bariatric surgery has been reported to be an effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, this evidence was not enough for different populations. Thus, we conducted a follow-up study to evaluate the effect of bariatric surgery on OSA in a Chinese population with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). From May 2011 to March 2014, 72 consecutive subjects with obesity and T2DM were recruited for this study. Before and at least 6 months after the laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LYGB) surgery, all subjects were asked to undergo a polysomnography test. During the sleep center visit, anthropometric characteristic data, blood samples, and sleep questionnaires were collected. In total, 44 Chinese participants with OSA were included in the study. Compared with baseline data, the postoperative anthropometric characteristics, blood measurements, and sleep recording data, such as weight, apnea hypopnea index (AHI), and insulin resistance index, differed significantly (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The change in AHI was correlated significantly with preoperative weight (râ€‰=â€‰0.298, pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), preoperative AHI (râ€‰=â€‰0.729, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), preoperative waist circumference (râ€‰=â€‰0.307, pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), and preoperative insulin resistance (IR) index (râ€‰=â€‰-0.301, pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Postoperative AHI was correlated significantly with age (râ€‰=â€‰0.039, pâ€‰=â€‰0.039) and preoperative AHI (râ€‰=â€‰0.445, pâ€‰=â€‰0.002), and the following prediction model was generated: log10 (postoperative AHI)â€‰=â€‰0.626â€‰Ã—â€‰log10 (preoperative AHI) +0.010â€‰Ã—â€‰age -0.581. Our findings indicate that LYGB could be an effective therapeutic intervention in the management of OSA for patients with both obesity and T2DM, and the preoperative AHI and age might be important factors that influence the effort of LYGB.",10.1007/s11695-014-1510-9,,,,721
149,Textbook Outcome in Bariatric Surgery: Evolution During 15 Years in a Referral Center.,"Textbook outcome (TO) is a multidimensional measure used to assess the quality of care. It is the ""ideal"" surgical result, based on a series of established indicators. In the field of bariatric surgery (BS), only one publication on TO is available. To determine TO in our BS unit and identify the factors linked to TO. University public hospital in Alicante (Spain). Retrospective observational study of all primary BS was performed. TO for BS was defined in relation to the following features: no major postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo >II), hospital stay <75th percentile, and no mortality or readmissions within 30 days of surgery. Comparative analysis of the characteristics of the TO and non-TO groups was performed, as well as univariate and multivariate logistic regressions, to identify the independent factors associated with obtaining TO. In 970 patients, TO was achieved in 71.5%. The hospital stay was the one that most affected achievement of TO. Analysis according to the type of procedure (sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass) did not reveal any differences between both procedures in terms of obtaining TO (71.5 vs 71.26%). Logistic regression identified smoking, heart disease, operative time, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding as independent factors associated with obtaining TO (p<0.05). Analysis of the annual evolution of TO reveals a progressive increase in its achievement (7.7-86.4%). In our series, TO was obtained in 71.5% of patients. The standardization of the technique and the experience gained over the years has improved our TO results.",10.1007/s11605-023-05690-0,,,,722
186,Changes in Bone Turnover Markers after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Versus Sleeve Gastrectomy: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to compare the alterations in bone turnover markers between SG and RYGB. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases to find the studies. There was significant less increment in osteocalcin [WMDâ€‰=â€‰â€‰-â€‰5.98, 95% CI (-â€‰9.30,â€‰-â€‰2.47) Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01] and parathyroid hormone (PTH) [WMDâ€‰=â€‰â€‰-â€‰9.59, 95% CI (-â€‰15.02,â€‰-â€‰4.16) Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01] in the SG group compared to the RYGB group. No significant differences were seen in change of C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (PINP), Ca, and 25(OH)-D between SG and RYGB groups. According to our meta-analysis, bone formation markers appear to have more increment following RYGB than SG. This observation is accompanied by a larger increase in PTH after RYGB patients compared to SG patients. PROSPERO: CRD42022308985.",10.1007/s11695-023-06503-8,,,,723
1096,Manometry of the Upper Gut Following Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Indicates That the Gastric Pouch and Roux Limb Act as a Common Cavity.,"The motility of the upper gut after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) is underexplored. We aimed to investigate the oesophago-gastro-Roux limb motor activity during fasting and after food intake. Eighteen morbidly obese patients were examined at least 2 years after RYGBP. A high-resolution manometry catheter was positioned to straddle the oesophagogastric junction, the gastric pouch and the proximal Roux limb using transmucosal potential difference measurements. Three patients with vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) were also studied. During the fasting state, the gastric pouch had low or no activity whereas the Roux limb exhibited regular migrating motility complexes (MMCs) being initiated just distal to gastroenteroanastomosis. Median cycle duration was 72 min, and the median propagating velocity of the phase III MMC phase was 2.7 cm/min (nâ€‰=â€‰8). When patients were asked to eat until they felt comfortably full, intraluminal pressure increased by 6 to 8 cmHâ‚‚O without any significant difference between gastric pouch and the Roux limb (nâ€‰=â€‰9). The increased intraluminal pressure following food intake correlated neither to weight loss nor to meal size or rate of eating. A successful RYGBP is associated with MMC in the Roux limb during fasting. The gastric pouch and the Roux limb behaved as a common cavity during food ingestion. Data do not support the hypothesis that the alimentary limb pressure in response to food intake influences either meal size or weight loss.",10.1007/s11695-015-1639-1,,,,724
136,Shorter History of Hypertension as a Predictor of Hypertension Remission after 3-years of Bariatric Surgery: Data from the GATEWAY Trial.,"Previous evidence explored predictors of hypertension (HTN) remission after bariatric but data are limited to observational studies and lack of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). This study was aimed to evaluate the rate of HTN remission after bariatric surgery using ABPM and to define predictors of mid-term HTN remission. We included patients enrolled in the surgical arm of the GATEWAY randomized trial. HTN remission was defined as controlled blood pressure (<â€‰130â€‰Ã—â€‰80Â mmHg) evaluated by 24-h ABPM while no need of anti-hypertensive medications after 36Â months. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to assess the predictors of HTN remission after 36Â months. 46 patients submitted Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). HTN remission occurred in 39% (nâ€‰=â€‰14 out of 36 patients with complete data at 36Â months). Patients with HTN remission had shorter HTN history than no remission group (5.9â€‰Â±â€‰5.5 vs. 12.5â€‰Â±â€‰8.1Â years; pâ€‰=â€‰0.01). The baseline insulin levels were lower in patients who presented HTN remission, although not statistically significant (OR: 0.90; CI 95%: 0.80-0.99; pâ€‰=â€‰0.07). In the multivariate analysis, the HTN history (years) was the only independent predictor of HTN remission (OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.70-0.97; pâ€‰=â€‰0.04). Therefore, for each additional year of HTN history, the chance of HTN remission decreases by approximately 15% after RYGB. After 3Â years of RYGB, HTN remission defined by ABPM was common and independently associated with a shorter HTN history. These data underscore the need of early effective approach of obesity aiming greater impact in its comorbidities.",10.1007/s11695-023-06711-2,,,,725
280,"Short- and long-term effects of body weight, calorie restriction and gastric bypass on CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 activity.","Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) may influence drug disposition due to surgery-induced gastrointestinal alterations and/or subsequent weight loss. The objective was to compare short- and long-term effects of RYGB and diet on the metabolic ratios of paraxanthine/caffeine (cytochrome P450 [CYP] 1A2 activity), 5-hydroxyomeprazole/omeprazole (CYP2C19 activity) and losartan/losartan carboxylic acid (CYP2C9 activity), and cross-sectionally compare these CYP-activities with normal-to-overweight controls. This trial included patients with severe obesity preparing for RYGB (nâ€‰=â€‰40) or diet-induced (nâ€‰=â€‰41) weight loss, and controls (nâ€‰=â€‰18). Both weight loss groups underwent a 3-week low-energy diet (<1200â€‰kcal/day, weeks 0-3) followed by a 6-week very-low-energy diet or RYGB (both <800â€‰kcal/day, weeks 3-9). Follow-up time was 2Â years, with four pharmacokinetic investigations. Meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SD weight loss from baseline was similar in the RYGB-group (13â€‰Â±â€‰2.4%) and the diet group (10.5â€‰Â±â€‰3.9%) at week 9, but differed at year 2 (RYGB -30â€‰Â±â€‰6.9%, diet -3.1â€‰Â±â€‰6.3%). From weeks 0 to 3, mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) CYP2C19 activity similarly increased in both groups (RYGB 43% [16, 55], diet 48% [22, 60]). Mean CYP2C19 activity increased by 30% (2.6, 43) after RYGB (weeks 3-9), but not in the diet-group (between-group difference -0.30 [-0.63, 0.03]). CYP2C19 activity remained elevated in the RYGB group at year 2. Baseline CYP2C19 activity was 2.7-fold higher in controls compared with patients with obesity, whereas no difference was observed in CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 activities. Our findings suggest that CYP2C19 activity is lower in patients with obesity and increases following weight loss. This may be clinically relevant for drug dosing. No clinically significant effect on CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 activities was observed.",10.1111/bcp.15349,,,,726
913,Melatonin premedication improves quality of recovery following bariatric surgery - a double blind placebo controlled prospective study.,"Melatonin has hypnotic, sedative, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, and is a widely used sleep agent. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of melatonin premedication on postoperative recovery in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. University Hospital, Israel. Patients undergoing bariatric surgery were randomized to receive either 5 mg melatonin (M group) or placebo (P group) once on the night before surgery and again 2 hours before surgery. Quality of recovery was assessed using the QoR-15, a 15 item questionnaire on quality of recovery after surgery and anesthesia, regarding emotional state, physical comfort, psychological support, pain, and physical independence. A maximal score of 140 suggested good recovery (1 question was omitted due to irrelevance). The patients answered the questionnaire in the preanesthesia clinic, on admission to the operating room, and on the first postoperative day. A total of 44 patients completed the study. There was no statistical difference between M and P groups in the mean QoR-15 scores obtained before the surgery. Mean postoperative QoR-15 score was higher in the M group compared with the P group (118.3Â±12.9 versus 107.8Â±18.7, respectively; P<.01). Scores were also higher in the M group regarding pain (P<.05) and quality of sleep (P< .05). Use of melatonin premedication improved the quality of recovery 1 day after bariatric surgery as measured by the QoR-15, specifically the quality of sleep and pain levels. Melatonin may serve as a premedication, especially when other options, like benzodiazepines are not recommended.",10.1016/j.soard.2016.11.001,,,,727
681,The Dutch bariatric weight loss chart: A multicenter tool to assess weight outcome up to 7 years after sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Current methods for weight loss assessment after bariatric surgery do not meet the high standards required to accurately judge patient outcome in a fair and evidence-based way. To build an evidence-based, versatile tool to assess weight loss and weight regain and identify poor responders up to 7 years after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), for any preoperative body mass index (BMI). Multicenter, observational study. Bariatric weight loss charts were built with standard deviation (SD) percentile (p) curves p+2SD/p+1SD/p50(median)/p-1SD/p-2SD, based on all last measured weight results after primary LRYGB and LSG, performed in 3 large bariatric centers, expressed with percentage total weight loss (%TWL) and percentage-alterable weight loss (%AWL), a special BMI-independent metric. The p-1SD %AWL curves were compared with popular bariatric criteria 50% excess weight loss and 20%TWL. The p50 %TWL curves were compared with %TWL outcome in literature (external validation). In total, 9393 patients (5516 LRYGB, 3877 LSG, baseline BMI 43.7 (Â±SD 5.3) kg/m2, age 43 (Â±SD 10.9) years, 20% male, 21% type 2 diabetes) had mean follow-up 26 (range, 0-109) months, with .09% 30-day mortality. Independent outcome is presented in percentile charts for %AWL and %TWL. Percentile curves p+2SD/p+1SD/p50/p-1SD/p-2SD showed for LRYGB 72%/62%/50%/38%/28%AWL at nadir, 66%/55%/43%/30%/17%AWL at 4 years, 64%/52%/38%/25%/11%AWL at 7 years, and for LSG 69%/58%/46%/34%/22%AWL, 65%/53%/38%/23%/12%AWL, and 63%/51%/35%/22%/9%AWL, respectively. Bariatric criteria 50% excess weight loss and 20%TWL matched with most insufficient results for LSG, but not for LRYGB (low specificities). Both p50 %TWL curves are comparable with long-term weight loss in bariatric literature. Just as well-known growth charts are essential for pediatrics, weight loss charts should become the tools of choice for bariatrics. These multicenter charts are baseline BMI independent, superior to current bariatric criteria, and quite intuitive to use. They allow to readily detect poor responders in any postoperative phase, monitor the effect of extra counseling, judge weight regain, and manage patient expectations.",10.1016/j.soard.2018.11.024,,,,728
140,LAPAROSCOPIC AND LAPAROTOMY BARIATRIC SURGERY IN A PUBLIC HOSPITAL IN BRAZIL: ARE THERE DIFFERENCES IN COSTS AND COMPLICATIONS?,"Despite its increasing popularity, laparoscopy is not the option for bariatric surgeries performed in the Brazilian public health system. To compare laparotomy and laparoscopic access in bariatric surgery, considering aspects such as morbidity, mortality, costs, and length of stay. The study included 80 patients who were randomly assigned to perform a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. They were equally divided in two groups, laparoscopic and laparotomy. The results obtained in the postoperative period were evaluated and compared according to the Ministry of Health protocol, and later, in their outpatient returns. The surgical time was similar in both groups (p=0.240). The costs of laparoscopic surgery proved to be higher, mainly due to staplers and staples. The patients included in the laparotomy group presented higher rates of severe complications, such as incisional hernia (p<0.001). Costs related to social security and management of postoperative complications were higher in the open surgery group (R$ 1,876.00 vs R$ 34,268.91). The costs related to social security and treatment of complications were substantially lower in laparoscopic access when compared to laparotomy. However, considering the operative procedure itself, the laparotomy remained cheaper. Finally, the length of stay, the rate of complications, and return to labor had more favorable results in the laparoscopic route.",10.1590/0102-672020230021e1739,,,,729
889,Serum lipidomics reveals early differential effects of gastric bypass compared with banding on phospholipids and sphingolipids independent of differences in weight loss.,"Circulating phospholipids and sphingolipids are implicated in obesity-related comorbidities such as insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. How bariatric surgery affects these important lipid markers is poorly understood. We sought to determine whether Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), which is associated with greater metabolic improvement, differentially affects the phosphosphingolipidome compared with adjustable gastric banding (AGB). Fasting sera were available from 59 obese women (body mass index range 37-51â€‰kgâ€‰m-2; n=37 RYGB and 22 AGB) before surgery, then at 1 (21 RYGB, 12 AGB) and 3 months follow-up (19 RYGB, 12 AGB). HPLC-MS/MS was used to quantify 131 lipids from nine structural classes. DXA measurements and laboratory parameters were also obtained. The associations between lipids and clinical measurements were studied with P-values adjusted for the false discovery rate (FDR). Both surgical procedures rapidly induced weight loss and improved clinical profiles, with RYGB producing better improvements in fat mass, and serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and orosomucoid (FDRâ€‰<10%). Ninety-three (of 131) lipids were altered by surgery-the majority decreasing-with 29 lipids differentially affected by RYGB during the study period. The differential effect of the surgeries remained statistically significant for 20 of these lipids after adjusting for differences in weight loss between surgery types. The RYGB signature consisted of phosphatidylcholine species not exceeding 36 carbons, and ceramides and sphingomyelins containing C22 to C25 fatty acids. RYGB also led to a sustained increase in unsaturated ceramide and sphingomyelin species. The RYGB-specific lipid changes were associated with decreases in body weight, total and LDL-C, orosomucoid and increased HOMA-S (FDRâ€‰<10%). Concomitant with greater metabolic improvement, RYGB induced early and sustained changes in phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins and ceramides that were independent of greater weight loss. These data suggest that RYGB may specifically alter sphingolipid metabolism, which, in part, could explain the better metabolic outcomes of this surgical procedure.",10.1038/ijo.2017.63,,,,730
1625,A biodegradeable membrane from porcine intestinal submucosa to reinforce the gastrojejunostomy in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: preliminary report.,"A Silastic ring has been used to prevent dilation of the gastrojejunostomy in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP). The use of a bio-membrane may prevent dilation of the anastomosis without the risks associated with prostheses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of applying such a bio-membrane around the gastrojejunostomy in Laparoscopic RYGBP (LRYGBP). We used a new bio-membrane, that is derived from porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) and acts as a scaffolding for the ingrowth of connective tissue. Over a 4-month period, 14 LRYGBP patients had their proximal anastomosis wrapped with 10 x 2.5 cm SIS by a single surgeon. We compared these patients to a control group of LRYGBP patients matched for BMI. The average age of the patients was 35.0 years (control group: 45.1 years). The patients had a mean initial BMI of 44.7 kg/m2 (+/- 5.9) standard error, and the control subjects had a mean initial BMI of 46.7 kg/m2 (+/- 6.5). SIS application took a mean time of 11 (+/- 3) minutes without any intraoperative complication. The median hospital stay was 3.5 days in the experimental group and 3.7 days in controls. Three patients developed a symptomatic stenosis at the gastrojejunostomy following surgery. In the control group there were two stenoses. At an average follow-up of 87 days (controls: 95 days), the mean reduction in BMI was 7.8 (+/- 0.8) kg/m2 [controls 8.6 kg/m2 (+/- 1.5)]. Application of SIS around the gastrojejunostomy in patients undergoing LRYGBP is feasible and safe. Further follow-up is required, however, to evaluate the effectiveness in preventing dilation of the anastomosis.",10.1381/096089201321209350,,,,731
1560,Glycolide copolymer staple-line reinforcement reduces staple site bleeding during laparoscopic gastric bypass: a prospective randomized trial.,"The use of staple-line reinforcement sleeves during laparoscopic gastric bypass reduces staple-line bleeding, which may translate into a reduction in the rate of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Prospective randomized trial. University hospital. Thirty-four patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass were randomly assigned to receive either no reinforcement (control group, n = 17) or reinforcement of the staple line with glycolic copolymer sleeves (treatment group, n = 17). Demographic data, the number of stapler loads used, the number of staple-line bleeding sites, the amount of blood loss, the length of time required to obtain hemostasis of the staple lines, operative time, intraoperative and postoperative complications, and serial hemoglobin levels. The mean number of stapler loads used was similar between groups. The mean number of staple-line bleeding sites was significantly fewer in the treatment group for division of gastric tissue (0.4 vs 2.5 bleeding sites), jejunal tissue (0.1 vs 0.6 bleeding site), and mesenteric tissue (0 vs 0.8 bleeding site). The mean blood loss was lower in the treatment group (84 vs 129 mL). Staple misfire occurred in 1 (0.7%) of 143 stapler loads used in the treatment group compared with 0 (0%) of 138 stapler loads used in the control group. The time to obtain staple-line hemostasis was shorter in the treatment group (1.2 vs 10.1 minutes). The total operative time was similar between groups. There was no mortality or postoperative leaks. One patient in the control group had postoperative gastrointestinal hemorrhage requiring blood transfusion and reoperation. There was no significant difference in the mean hemoglobin level between groups on the first postoperative day. The use of glycolide copolymer staple-line reinforcement sleeves in patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass is safe and significantly reduces staple-line bleeding sites and may reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage.",10.1001/archsurg.140.8.773,,,,732
1087,Impact of perioperative management of glycemia in severely obese diabetic patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery is associated with rapid postsurgical improvement in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2 DM). However, there is little outcome-based evidence to guide the glycemic management of this patient group preoperatively. We conducted 2 pilot studies randomizing patients to assess the impact of intensive glucose management pre- and post-RYGB on clinical outcomes after surgery. University hospital. In the GLUCOSURG-pre randomized controlled trial (RCT), 34 obese T2 DM patients with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1 c) â‰¥8.5% (69 mmol/mol) undergoing RYGB were randomly assigned to receive either glucose optimization or no optimization 3 months preoperatively. In the GLUCOSURG-post RCT, 35 obese T2 DM patients on insulin were randomly assigned to either intensive or conservative glucose management up to 2 weeks post- RYGB. HbA1c at 1 year post-RYGB was the primary outcome. In GLUCOSURG-pre, the HbA1 c at 1 year postsurgery was -3.0% (51.9 mmol/mol) in the optimized and -4.0% (45.4 mmol/mol) in the nonoptimized groups (P = .06). In GLUCOSURG-post, there were no significant differences in HbA1 c at 1 year postsurgery between the intensive and conservative groups [-2.4% (44.3 mmol/mol)] versus [-2.3% (44.3 mmol/mol), P = .73)]. Our pilot studies suggested that neither intensive management of glycemia in the 3 months pre- RYGB, nor the first 2 weeks post-RYGB resulted in better glycemic control one year after surgery. RYGB has substantial effects on glucose control, and additional intensive glucose-lowering interventions do not confer clinical benefits compared to conservative approaches.",10.1016/j.soard.2014.11.004,,,,733
1005,An optimized multivitamin supplement lowers the number of vitamin and mineral deficiencies three years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a cohort study.,"Vitamin and mineral deficiencies are common after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. In particular, inadequate serum concentrations of ferritin and vitamin B12 have been found in 11% and 23% (respectively) of patients using a standard multivitamin supplement (sMVS) 1 year after RYGB. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Weight Loss Surgery (WLS) ForteÂ® (a pharmaceutical-grade, optimized multivitamin supplement) compared with an sMVS and a control group (nonuser) 3 years after RYGB. General hospital specialized in bariatric surgery. A follow-up cohort study of a triple-blind randomized, controlled clinical trial. At baseline 148 patients were enrolled (74 [50%] in the sMVS group and 74 [50%] in the WLS Forte group). After a mean follow-up of 36 months, 11 (7%) patients were lost to follow-up, of whom 2 were secondary to death. At the end of the study, 11 (17%) patients in the WLS Forte and 17 (24%) in the sMVS group stopped using a supplement. In addition, 64 (47%) patients were using WLS Forte and 45 (33%) patients a sMVS. Patient characteristics and follow-up length were comparable between the groups. Significantly more patients were diagnosed with anemia (16% versus 3% [P = .021]), a ferritin deficiency (14% versus 3% [P = .043]), and a zinc deficiency (8% versus 0% [P = .033]) in the sMVS group compared with WLS Forte. Five patients developed a vitamin B12 deficiency while using WLS Forte, versus 15 of sMVS users (P = .001). No adverse events occurred that were related to supplement use. At 3 years postoperative of RYGB, an optimized multivitamin supplement (WLS Forte) was more effective in reducing anemia and ferritin, vitamin B12, and zinc deficiencies compared with a standard supplement and control.",10.1016/j.soard.2015.12.010,,,,734
205,Optimal common limb length in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery: is it important for an ideal outcome? - a systematic review.,"In Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery the common limb length (CLL) is thought to significantly impact on nutritional and metabolic outcomes. However, there has been little focus on establishing routine standardized CLL measurements and its subsequent effect on weight loss and nutritional status. This review aimed to determine the effect of variations of CLL in RYGB surgery on post-operative outcomes, particularly nutritional status, while considering the need for routine CLL measurements in addition to measuring biliopancreatic limb and alimentary limb lengths. A systematic review was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. All English language articles addressing CLL and impact on weight loss, nutritional and metabolic outcomes were retrieved and reviewed. Thirteen relevant studies were identified with CLLs varying from 76 to >600â€‰cm. No significant difference in total body weight loss or excess weight loss was observed. Significant metabolic improvements occurred with shorter CLLs. Nutritional deficiencies were more severe when the CLL was <400â€‰cm. The data from this systematic review suggests that reasonable weight loss and positive impacts on metabolic outcomes can be achieved with CLLs of >400â€‰cm.",10.1111/ans.18192,,,,735
1138,Laparoscopic gastric banding resolves the metabolic syndrome and improves lipid profile over five years in obese patients with body mass index 30-40 kg/m(2.).,"Obesity, metabolic syndrome (MS) and dyslipidemia are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Bariatric surgery is increasingly recognized as an effective intervention for improving each of these risk factors. There are sparse data on the long-term durability of metabolic changes associated with bariatric surgery, in particular with laparoscopic gastric banding (LGB). Our objective was to evaluate the durability of metabolic changes associated with LGB in nonmorbid obesity. Fifty obese patients (BMI 30-40) with â‰¥1 obesity-related comorbidity were prospectively followed for five years. At follow-up, subjects underwent fasting blood measures, including lipid NMR spectroscopy and standard lipid profile. Forty-seven patients (45 female, mean age 43.8 years) completed four years follow-up (46 completed five years). Baseline BMI was 35.1 Â± 2.6. Subjects exhibited mean weight loss of 22.3 Â± 7.9 kg (22.9 Â± 7.4%) at year one and maintained this (19.8 Â± 10.2%) over five years. At baseline, 43% (20/47) of subjects met criteria for MS. This was reduced to 15% (7/47) at year one and remained reduced over five years (13%, 6/46) (p < 0.001). There were reductions in triglycerides (p < 0.001) and increases in HDL cholesterol (HDL-C, p < 0.001) and HDL particle concentration (p = 0.02), with a trend toward increased HDL particle size (p = 0.06) at year five. Changes in triglycerides and HDL-C were more prominent in patients with MS at baseline, but unassociated with weight loss or waist circumference. Changes in HDL particle size and concentration were not associated with MS status, weight loss, waist circumference, or statin use. LGB produces significant weight loss, resolution of MS and changes in lipid profile suggestive of beneficial HDL remodeling. These changes persist five years following LGB.",10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2014.08.030,,,,736
888,The Use of Unidirectional Knotless Barbed Suture for Enterotomy Closure in Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: a Randomized Comparative Study.,"In this study, we assessed feasibility, safety, and time efficiency of laparoscopic running enterotomy closure for linear stapled Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) using unidirectional barbed sutures (Stratafixâ„¢ 2/0- Ethicon). Two hundred patients undergoing laparoscopic RYGB were prospectively randomized regarding running enterotomy closure of the linear stapled gastrojejunal (GJA) and jejunojejunal anastomosis (JJA). Two groups were created: V-group (VicrylÂ® 2/0-Ethicon) and S-group (Stratafixâ„¢ 2/0-Ethicon). Time spent on closing the enterotomies was measured from first needle in until knot and cut (V-group) or last stitch and cut (S-group). If needed, a nonabsorbable ""correction"" (""c""; in order to close a small hiatus at the anastomosis) or hemostatic (""h"") stitch was made (using a single ProleneÂ® 2/0-Ethicon). Average total procedure time was similar (S-group 1:01:22, V-group 1:00:44, PÂ =Â 0.340). Closure of the enterotomy (GJA) was significantly shorter in the S-group (07:41Â min versus 08:13Â min in the V-group, PÂ =Â 0.005). Extra stitches (GJA) were performed in 33 patients (16.5%): 3 (h) and 20 (c) in the V-group and 1 (h) and 9 (c) in the S-group. Four patients in the V-group suffered from postoperative intraluminal bleeding (3 self-limiting, 1 underwent endoscopic clipping). In the S-group, 1 patient suffered from leakage at the vertical transected staple line of the stomach. The use of unidirectional barbed sutures for running enterotomy closure after linear stapled RYGB is feasible and safe. Significant time benefit was seen regarding the closure of the GJA. Fewer additional stitches were necessary and postoperative intraluminal bleeding was less encountered.",10.1007/s11695-017-2628-3,,,,737
1004,Bile acids synthesis decreases after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.,"Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment alternative in morbid obesity. The mechanisms contributing to these benefits remain poorly understood. Bile acids (BAs) are mediators of different regulatory functions in glucose and cholesterol homeostasis and energy expenditure. Recent evidence suggests that BAs are critically important for the beneficial effects of sleeve gastrectomy (SG). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of SG on BA synthesis. University Hospital. Santiago, Chile. Obese patients were evaluated before and after SG (1, 3, 6, and 12 months). BA synthesis was evaluated through the serum marker, 7 Î±-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4). Primary and secondary BA and C4 were determined by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-MS/MS). From June 2013 to January 2014, 19 patients (age 37.6Â±7.8 years; BMI 35.8Â±3.5 kg/m(2); 79% female) were included in this study. Mean weight loss at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months was 11.3, 17.5, 23.6, and 25.4 kg, respectively, equivalent to 11.8, 18.6, 24.8, and 26.9 of total body water percentage (%TBW) (P<.0001), respectively and 43.2, 68.2, 91, and 98.8 of percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL), respectively (P<.001). Serum C4 levels at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were 23.4Â±21.1, 4.9Â±8.2, 8.7Â±12.1, 13.8Â±12.9, and 18.8Â±16.8 ng/mL (P<.0001), respectively. Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) levels at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were 71Â±33.3, 130.5Â±66.2, 117.8Â±57.2, 134.6Â±91.7, and 124.3Â±85.9 pg/mL (P = .019), respectively. Serum levels of C4 decrease after SG, indicating a reduction in the synthesis of BA. FGF19 may play a role in decreasing BA synthesis. Further studies are necessary to characterize the effect of bariatric surgery on BA homeostasis.",10.1016/j.soard.2015.11.015,,,,738
1014,The risk of kidney stones following bariatric surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"With rising prevalence of morbid obesity, the number of bariatric surgeries performed each year has been increasing worldwide. The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the risk of kidney stones following bariatric surgery. A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception through July 2015. Only studies reporting relative risks, odd ratios or hazard ratios (HRs) to compare risk of kidney stones in patients who underwent bariatric surgery versus no surgery were included. Pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance method. Four studies (One randomized controlled trial and three cohort studies) with 11,348 patients were included in analysis to assess the risk of kidney stones following bariatric surgery. The pooled RR of kidney stones in patients undergoing bariatric surgery was 1.22 (95% CI, 0.63-2.35). The type of bariatric surgery subgroup analysis demonstrated an increased risk of kidney stones in patients following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) with the pooled RR of 1.73 (95% CI, 1.30-2.30) and a decreased risk of kidney stones in patients following restrictive procedures including laparoscopic banding or sleeve gastrectomy with the pooled RR of 0.37 (95% CI, 0.16-0.85). Our meta-analysis demonstrates an association between RYGB and increased risk of kidney stones. Restrictive bariatric surgery, on the other hand, may decrease kidney stone risk. Future study with long-term follow-up data is needed to confirm this potential benefit of restrictive bariatric surgery.",10.3109/0886022X.2015.1137186,,,,739
1273,Metabolic effects of bariatric surgery in patients with moderate obesity and type 2 diabetes: analysis of a randomized control trial comparing surgery with intensive medical treatment.,"To evaluate the effects of two bariatric procedures versus intensive medical therapy (IMT) on Î²-cell function and body composition. This was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of 60 subjects with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 9.7 Â± 1%) and moderate obesity (BMI 36 Â± 2 kg/m(2)) randomized to IMT alone, IMT plus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or IMT plus sleeve gastrectomy. Assessment of Î²-cell function (mixed-meal tolerance testing) and body composition was performed at baseline and 12 and 24 months. Glycemic control improved in all three groups at 24 months (N = 54), with a mean HbA1c of 6.7 Â± 1.2% for gastric bypass, 7.1 Â± 0.8% for sleeve gastrectomy, and 8.4 Â± 2.3% for IMT (P < 0.05 for each surgical group versus IMT). Reduction in body fat was similar for both surgery groups, with greater absolute reduction in truncal fat in gastric bypass versus sleeve gastrectomy (-16 vs. -10%; P = 0.04). Insulin sensitivity increased significantly from baseline in gastric bypass (2.7-fold; P = 0.004) and did not change in sleeve gastrectomy or IMT. Î²-Cell function (oral disposition index) increased 5.8-fold in gastric bypass from baseline, was markedly greater than IMT (P = 0.001), and was not different between sleeve gastrectomy versus IMT (P = 0.30). At 24 months, Î²-cell function inversely correlated with truncal fat and prandial free fatty acid levels. Bariatric surgery provides durable glycemic control compared with intensive medical therapy at 2 years. Despite similar weight loss as sleeve gastrectomy, gastric bypass uniquely restores pancreatic Î²-cell function and reduces truncal fat, thus reversing the core defects in diabetes.",10.2337/dc12-1596,,,,740

Similar data are lacking from India. To compare the histologic features of NAFLD in morbidly obese Indian patients before and 6 months after bariatric surgery. Histologic changes were also separately assessed according to the type of bariatric intervention. Teaching institution, India; private practice. All patients undergoing bariatric surgery from July 2012 to July 2013 underwent a routine liver biopsy at the time of bariatric surgery. If the biopsy specimen indicated NAFLD, patients were asked to undergo a second biopsy after 6 months. Baseline anthropometry, clinical data, biochemistry, and pathology were recorded and repeated at follow-up. Eighty-eight of 134 index biopsy specimens indicated NAFLD. Thirty patients had paired liver biopsies. Steatosis was present in all, 14 had lobular inflammation, 10 had ballooning degeneration, and 14 had fibrosis. Mean time between the biopsies was 7.1 months (range 6-8 months). At the second biopsy, steatosis had resolution in 19 and improvement in 11, lobular inflammation had resolution in 12 and improvement in 2, ballooning had resolution in 9 and improvement in 1 and fibrosis had resolution in 11 and improvement in 3 (P<0.05 for all). Improvement was greater among those who underwent a sleeve gastrectomy in comparison to a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, although this difference was not statistically significant. None had worsening of liver histologic results.

The BS has improved the dyslipidemia of the insulin resistant patient, our objective was to evaluate if there was a difference in the lipid profile between the laparoscopic roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) technique vs. the sleeve gastrectomy (SG) technique at 18 months of follow-up. An observational, open, prospective study of morbidly obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery at 18-month follow-up. Anthropometric analysis, body composition, energy expenditure at rest, glucose, insulin, HbA1c, LDL, HDL, TG and CT were performed. Absence baseline differences were found in the proportion of patients with hypertension, diabetes, steatosis, and sex between the RYGB vs SG groups. A reduction of TG was observed at 6 months in favor of RYGB vs SG: 108.60Â±34.86 vs. 124.59Â±44.58, P = 0.044), however, a decrease in both LDL levels was found at 12 and 18 months in favor of the RYGB vs. SG group: 96.23Â±24.33 vs. 107.83Â±28.88, P = 0.025; 90.98Â±20.62 vs 106.22Â±31.48, P = 0.003; the decrease in CT was observed only at 18 months in favor of the RYGB vs. SG group: 171.39Â±25.058 vs. 186.89Â±31.81, P = 0.005. CONCLUSIÃ³N: RYBG has shown to be more effective in reducing LDL and CT levels compared to SG, which provides an additional benefit of RYGB in relation to the lipid profile of the patient.",10.1016/j.arteri.2021.09.005,,,,742
1470,Effect of early enteral feeding after upper gastrointestinal surgery.,"The impact of early enteral nutrition in elective upper gastrointestinal surgery was the focus of this study, with particular reference to its feasibility and benefits. This prospective study was carried out over 2 years. The study group included 30 patients and the control group had 31patients. Twenty-two patients in each group underwent truncal vagotomy and gastrojejunostomy for chronic duodenal ulcer and gastric outlet obstruction. Eight patients in the study group and nine in the control group underwent gastrectomy for carcinoma stomach. A standard milk-based diet was initiated 12 hours after surgery through a nasojejunal tube. The patients were monitored for side effects of enteral feeding and postoperative infective complications. Nitrogen balance and nutritional parameters like the body weight, serum albumin, and serum transferrin were measured pre and postoperatively. The groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, and preoperative nutritional factors like body weight, serum albumin, and serum transferrin. The return of bowel sounds and passage of flatus took place significantly earlier in the study group (1.43 vs. 2.81 days). Diarrhoea and abdominal cramps were the significant complications noted in the study group in relation to early enteral feeding. No patient required withdrawal of enteral feeds. They showed a positive nitrogen balance on the fourth postoperative day. The patients in the study group showed significant increase in the serum transferrin level compared with the preoperative level but the serum albumin level was not significantly altered. Early enteral feeding through the nasojejunal tube following elective upper gastrointestinal surgery is feasible, safe and improves the nutritional status.",,,,,743
1615,The effect of bi-level positive airway pressure on postoperative pulmonary function following gastric surgery for obesity.,"The severely obese patient has varying degrees of intrinsic reduction of expiratory flow rates and lung volumes. Thus, the severely obese patient is predisposed to postoperative atelectasis, ineffective clearing of respiratory secretions, and other pulmonary complications. This study evaluated the effect of bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) on pulmonary function in obese patients following open gastric bypass surgery Patients with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 40 kg/m2 who were undergoing elective gastric bypass were eligible to be randomized to receive either BiPAP during the first 24 h postoperatively or conventional postoperative care. Patients with significant cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases were excluded from the study. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), and percent hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO2) were measured preoperatively, and on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3. Twenty-seven patients were entered in the study 14 received BiPAP and 13 received conventional postoperative care. There was no significant difference preoperatively between the study and control groups in regards to age, BMI, FVC, FEV1.0, PEFR or SpO2. Postoperatively expiratory flow was decreased in both groups. However, the FVC and FEV1.0 were significantly higher on each of the three consecutive postoperative days in the patients who received BiPAP therapy. The SpO2 was significantly decreased in the control group over the same time period. Prophylactic BiPAP during the first 12-24 h postoperatively resulted in significantly higher measures of pulmonary function in severely obese patients who had undergone elective gastric bypass surgery. These improved measures of pulmonary function, however, did not translate into fewer hospital days or a lower complication rate in our study population of otherwise healthy obese patients. Further study is necessary to determine if BiPAP therapy in the first 24 postoperative hours would be of benefit in severely obese patients with comorbid illnesses who have undergone elective gastric bypass.",10.1053/rmed.2002.1357,,,,744
141,Outcomes of single anastomosis duodeno ileal bypass and single anastomosis stomach ileal bypass for type II diabetes: a systematic review.,"Bariatric surgery has demonstrated long-term effectiveness in inducing weight loss and improving metabolic parameters for obesity. Single anastomosis duodeno-ileal (SADI) bypass and single anastomosis sleeve-ileal (SASI) bypass have both emerged as new promising bariatric procedures. In this paper, we review the existing literature and compare the outcomes of SADI and SASI bypass procedures in regard to weight loss, complication rate, and improvement of type II diabetes (T2DM). This has not yet been done in the preexisting literature. We conducted a systematic literature search of electronic databases focusing on weight loss outcomes, rate of complications and remission, or improvement of T2DM and other obesity-related comorbidities. Seventeen studies on SADI and nine studies on SASI were included. Both are similar in terms of surgical technique and have demonstrated fewer complications when compared to other bariatric procedures. Mean preoperative BMI was similar in both study groups: 46.4â€‰kg/m2 in SADI and 48.8â€‰kg/m2 in SASI. Mean %EWL at 12â€‰months in the SADI group was 74.1% compared to 77.4% in the SASI group. Preoperative severity of T2DM appeared to be higher in the SASI patient group, with a higher preoperative HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels. T2DM resolution was achieved in a significant proportion of both SADI and SASI patient populations (78.5% in SADI and 89.0% in SASI). Complication rates were comparable for both procedures. Both SADI and SASI are effective in inducing weight loss at 12â€‰months, with a low rate of major complications and mortality. From the studies included in this review, the SASI procedure had a higher impact on T2DM resolution compared to SADI.",10.1080/17446651.2023.2218919,,,,745
248,Opioid prescribing practices following bariatric surgery: a systematic review and pooled proportion meta-analysis.,"A paucity of literature exists regarding current opioid prescribing and use following bariatric surgery. We aimed to characterize opioid prescribing practices and use following bariatric surgery to inform future studies and optimized prescribing practices. We performed a systematic review of Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Library (via WILEY) on August 20, 2021. Two reviewers reviewed and extracted data independently. Studies evaluating adult patients undergoing bariatric surgery that reported opioid prescriptions at discharge were included. Abstracts, non-English studies, and those with nâ€‰<â€‰5 were excluded. Primary outcomes assessed the amount of morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) prescribed at discharge. Secondary outcomes evaluated opioids used following discharge, proportion of patients with unused opioid, and if unused opioids were properly discarded. We evaluated 2113 studies, with 18 undergoing full-text review, and 5 meeting inclusion criteria. Overall, 847 patients were included, with 450 (53%) undergoing sleeve gastrectomy and 393 (46%) receiving Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Most patients were female (nâ€‰=â€‰484/589, 82.2%), and the average age and BMI were 44.6 (Â±â€‰11.8) years and 48.1Â kg/m2 (Â±â€‰8.4Â kg/m2), respectively. On average, 348.4 MMEs were prescribed to patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Patients used only 84.7 MMEs, with 87.0% (95% CI 66.0-99.0%) having unused opioid, and 41/120 (34.2%) retaining these excess opioids. Nearly 90% of all bariatric patients evaluated in our systematic review are prescribed excessive opioids at discharge. Further work characterizing current opioid prescribing practices and use may help guide development of standardized post-bariatric surgery prescription guidelines.",10.1007/s00464-022-09481-7,,,,746
1451,Surgery for nonobese type 2 diabetic patients: an interventional study with duodenal-jejunal exclusion.,"A 24-week interventional prospective trial was performed to compare the benefits of open duodenal-jejunal exclusion surgery (GJB) with a matched control group on standard medical care. One-hundred eighty patients were screened for the surgical approach. Twelve patients accepted to be operated and presented the full eligibility criteria for surgery that includes overweight BMI (25-29.9 kg/m2), T2DM diagnosis for less than 15 years, insulin-treated patients, no history of major complications, preserved beta-cell function, and absence of autoimmunity. A matched control group (CG) of patients whom refused surgical treatment was placed to receive standard care. Patients had age of 50 (5) years, time of diagnosis 9 years (range, 3 to 15 years), time of insulin usage 6 months (range, 3 to 48 months), fasting glucose (FG), 9.8 (2.5) mg/dL, and glycated hemoglobin (A1C) 8.90 (2.12)%. At 24 weeks after surgery, patients experienced greater reductions on FG (14% vs. 7% on CG), A1C (from 8.78 to 7.84 in GJB-p<0.01 and 8.93 to 8.71 in CG; p<0.05 between groups) and reductions on average daily insulin requirement (93% vs. 29%, p<0.01). Ten patients stopped insulin usage in GJB but they remain taking oral medications. No differences were observed in both groups regarding BMI, body distribution and composition, blood pressure, and lipids. In conclusion, duodenal-jejunal exclusion was an effective treatment for nonobese T2DM subjects. GJB was superior to standard care in achieving better glycemic control along with reduction in insulin requirements.",10.1007/s11695-009-9844-4,,,,747
971,"Endoluminal Revision (OverStitch (TM) , Apollo Endosurgery) of the Dilated Gastroenterostomy in Patients with Late Dumping Syndrome After Proximal Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.","Dumping syndrome is a long-term postoperative complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedures. Morphologically, dumping syndrome usually correlates with a dilatation of the gastroenterostomy with accelerated pouch emptying. Conservative therapy includes diet changes, complementary pharmacotherapy and, if symptoms persist, surgical revision. Surgical options include endoscopic, endoluminal surgery to constrict the gastrojejunostomy using a novel endoscopic suturing device (OverStitch(TM), Apollo). In our study, we aimed to assess the viability, safety and efficacy of this procedure in patients with late dumping; 14 patients who had developed late dumping syndrome underwent surgery using an endoscopic suturing technique (OverStitch(TM), Apollo). Late dumping was confirmed by Sigstad score and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Prior to surgery, objective analysis of pouch emptying speed was assessed by gastric scintigraphy. Surgery was performed under general anaesthesia. None of the 14 patients suffered intra- or postoperative complications. No postsurgical increase in inflammation parameters was observed. The postinterventional pain scale (visual analogue scale) showed a mean score of 0.5 (range 0-10). In 13 of the 14 patients, no dumping was observed 1-month postsurgery. The postoperative Sigstad score (3.07Â Â±Â 2.06; range 1-9) showed an impressive reduction compared with the preoperative score (12.71Â Â±Â 4.18; range 7-24) (pÂ <Â 0.001). Postoperative upper gastrointestinal gastrografin swallow revealed regular emptying in all the patients. The endoluminal endoscopic suturing technique-applied here for surgical revision of gastroenterostomy following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass-represents a promising, novel therapeutic option in late dumping syndrome involving minimal trauma and offering rapid reconvalescence.",10.1007/s11695-016-2266-1,,,,748
1065,Risk Factors for Marginal Ulcer After Gastric Bypass Surgery for Obesity: A Population-based Cohort Study.,"This study aimed to assess risk factors for developing marginal ulcer (MU) after gastric bypass (GBP) surgery for obesity. MU is a common and potentially serious complication of GBP surgery, little is known about its etiology. This population-based cohort study of GBP in 2006-2011 evaluated MU in relation to diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ulcer history, use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for confounding. Among 20,294 GBP patients, diabetes and peptic ulcer history entailed statistically significantly increased risk of MU (HRâ€Š=â€Š1.26, 95% CI 1.03-1.55 and HR â€Š=â€Š 2.70, 95% CI 1.81-4.03), although hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and COPD did not. PPI users had an increased HR of MU (HR â€Š=â€Š 1.37, 95% CI 1.17-1.60). Aspirin and NSAID consumption less than or equal to median entailed decreased HRs of MU (HR â€Š=â€Š 0.56, 95% CI 0.37-0.86 and HR â€Š=â€Š 0.30, 95% CI 0.24-0.38), although aspirin and NSAID users more than median had an increased risk and no association with MU, respectively (HR â€Š=â€Š 1.90, 95% CI 1.41-2.58 and HR â€Š=â€Š 0.90, 95% CI 0.76-1.87). The use of SSRI less than or equal to median had a decreased risk of MU (HR â€Š=â€Š 0.50, 95% CI 0.37-0.67), although use more than median entailed increased HR (HR â€Š=â€Š 1.26, 95% CI 1.01-1.56). Diabetes and peptic ulcer history seem to be risk factors for MU, but not hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or COPD. Limited doses of aspirin, NSAIDs, and SSRIs might not increase the risk, although higher doses of aspirin do. The association with PPI could be due to confounding by indication.",10.1097/SLA.0000000000001300,,,,749
1434,Acute effects of gastric bypass versus gastric restrictive surgery on beta-cell function and insulinotropic hormones in severely obese patients with type 2 diabetes.,"Hyperglycemia resolves quickly after bariatric surgery, but the underlying mechanism and the most effective type of surgery remains unclear. To examine glucose metabolism and beta-cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) after two types of bariatric intervention; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and gastric restrictive (GR) surgery. Prospective, nonrandomized, repeated-measures, 4-week, longitudinal clinical trial. In all, 16 T2DM patients (9 males and 7 females, 52+/-14 years, 47+/-9 kg m(-2), HbA1c 7.2+/-1.1%) undergoing either RYGB (N=9) or GR (N=7) surgery. Glucose, insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity at baseline, and 1 and 4 weeks post-surgery, using hyperglycemic clamps and C-peptide modeling kinetics; glucose, insulin secretion and gut-peptide responses to mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) at baseline and 4 weeks post-surgery. At 1 week post-surgery, both groups experienced a similar weight loss and reduction in fasting glucose (P<0.01). However, insulin sensitivity increased only after RYGB, (P<0.05). At 4 weeks post-surgery, weight loss remained similar for both groups, but fasting glucose was normalized only after RYGB (95+/-3 mg 100 ml(-1)). Insulin sensitivity improved after RYGB (P<0.01) and did not change with GR, whereas the disposition index remained unchanged after RYGB and increased 30% after GR (P=0.10). The MMTT elicited a robust increase in insulin secretion, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels and beta-cell sensitivity to glucose only after RYGB (P<0.05). RYGB provides a more rapid improvement in glucose regulation compared with GR. This improvement is accompanied by enhanced insulin sensitivity and beta-cell responsiveness to glucose, in part because of an incretin effect.",10.1038/ijo.2009.254,,,,750
382,Patient-reported Outcomes After Metabolic Surgery Versus Medical Therapy for Diabetes: Insights From the STAMPEDE Randomized Trial.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term effects of medical and surgical treatments of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Robust data on PROs from randomized trials comparing medical and surgical treatments for T2DM are lacking. The Surgical Treatment And Medications Potentially Eradicate Diabetes Efficiently (STAMPEDE) trial showed that 5 years after randomization, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) were superior to intensive medical therapy (IMT) alone in achieving glycemic control in patients with T2DM and obesity. A subset of 104 patients participating in the STAMPEDE trial were administered two generic health-related quality of life (QoL) questionnaires (RAND-36 and EQ-5D-3L) and a diabetes-specific instrument at baseline, and then on an annual basis up to 5 years after randomization. On longitudinal analysis, RYGB and SG significantly improved the domains of physical functioning, general health perception, energy/fatigue, and diabetes-related QoL compared with IMT group. In the IMT group, none of the QoL components in the generic questionnaires improved significantly from baseline. No significant long-term differences were observed among the study groups in measures of psychological and social aspects of QoL. On multivariable analysis, independent factors associated with improved general health perception at long-term included baseline general health (P < 0.001), insulin independence at 5 years (P = 0.005), RYGB versus IMT (P = 0.005), and SG versus IMT (P = 0.034). Favorable changes following RYGB and SG were comparable. In patients with T2DM, metabolic surgery is associated with long-term favorable changes in certain PROs compared with IMT, mainly on physical health and diabetes-related domains. Psychosocial well-being warrants greater attention after metabolic surgery.",10.1097/SLA.0000000000005003,,,,751
778,Effect of the Duodenal-Jejunal Bypass Liner on Glycemic Control in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes With Obesity: A Meta-analysis With Secondary Analysis on Weight Loss and Hormonal Changes.,"Duodenal-jejunal bypass liner (DJBL) is an endoscopic device that may mimic small bowel mechanisms of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of DJBL at inducing weight loss. We assessed the effect of DJBL on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with obesity. Data sources included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science through 1 July 2017. Included were published studies that assessed DJBL outcomes in obese T2D patients. Primary outcomes were change in HbA1c and HOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Secondary outcomes were change in weight and gut hormones glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY), and ghrelin. Seventeen studies were included. At explant, HbA1c decreased by 1.3% [95% CI 1.0, 1.6] and HOMA-IR decreased by 4.6 [2.9, 6.3]. Compared with control subjects, DJBL subjects had greater HbA1c reduction by 0.9% [0.5, 1.3]. Six months after explant, HbA1c remained lower than baseline by 0.9% [0.6, 1.2]. At explant, patients lost 11.3 kg [10.3, 12.2], corresponding to a BMI reduction of 4.1 kg/m2 [3.4, 4.9], total weight loss of 18.9% [7.2, 30.6], and excess weight loss of 36.9% [29.2, 44.6]. The amount of weight loss remained significant at 1 year postexplantation. After DJBL, GIP decreased, whereas GLP-1, PYY, and ghrelin increased. DJBL improves glycemic control and insulin resistance in T2D patients with obesity. DJBL also appears to induce significant weight loss in this population. Additionally, changes in gut hormones suggest mechanisms similar to RYGB. Study limitations included heterogeneity among studies.",10.2337/dc17-1985,,,,752
1590,Randomized clinical trial of hand-assisted laparoscopic versus open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for the treatment of morbid obesity.,": Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) has increased in popularity since the introduction of the laparoscopic procedure, but this approach requires extensive surgical skill and the learning curve is steep. The present study examined the suitability of hand-assisted laparoscopy for RYGBP. In a prospective trial, 50 patients (median age 38 years, body mass index 45 kg/m(2)) were randomized to either hand-assisted (n = 25) or open (n = 25) RYGBP. The hand-assisted device was introduced through a right subcostal incision. Laparoscopic staplers were also used in the open group, allowing a short upper midline incision. The gastrojejunostomy was made by means of a circular stapler and the Roux limb placed behind the colon and excluded stomach. The postoperative outcome, with respect to morphine consumption, complications, hospital stay (6 days) and weight loss, was similar in the two groups. The operating time was significantly longer in the hand-assisted group (150 versus 85 min; P < 0.001) but there was no conversion to open operation. One patient in the hand-assisted group was reoperated owing to leakage and one patient developed an incisional hernia after open RYGBP. The hand-assisted technique was feasible and allowed good working conditions in all patients. However, the postoperative outcome was excellent in both groups and there was no advantage to the hand-assisted technique.",10.1002/bjs.4505,,,,753
314,Is Adherence to Follow-Up After Bariatric Surgery Necessary? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The association of adherence to follow-up (FU) after laparoscopic gastric bypass - and gastric sleeve with weight loss (WL) is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate this association. Fourteen full text articles were included in the systematic review. Eight studies were included in the meta-analysis concerning FU up to 3Â years postoperatively and 3 for the FU between 3 and 10Â years postoperatively. Results showed a significant association between adherence to FU 0.5 to 3Â years postoperatively and percentage excess WL (%EWL) but did not demonstrate a significant association between FUâ€‰>â€‰3Â years postoperatively and total WL (%TWL). In conclusion, adherence to FU may not be associated with WL and therefore stringent lifelong FU in its current form should be evaluated.",10.1007/s11695-021-05857-1,,,,754
867,Alcohol and other substance use after bariatric surgery: prospective evidence from a U.S. multicenter cohort study.,"Empirical evidence suggests Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) increases risk of developing alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, prospective assessment of substance use disorders (SUD) after bariatric surgery is limited. To report SUD-related outcomes after RYGB and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). To identify factors associated with incident SUD-related outcomes. 10 U.S. hospitals METHODS: The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 is a prospective cohort study. Participants self-reported past-year AUD symptoms (determined by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test), illicit drug use (cocaine, hallucinogens, inhalants, phencyclidine, amphetamines, or marijuana), and SUD treatment (counseling or hospitalization for alcohol or drugs) presurgery and annually postsurgery for up to 7 years through January 2015. Of 2348 participants who underwent RYGB or LAGB, 2003 completed baseline and follow-up assessments (79.2% women, baseline median age: 47 years, median body mass index 45.6). The year-5 cumulative incidence of postsurgery onset AUD symptoms, illicit drug use, and SUD treatment were 20.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 18.5-23.3), 7.5% (95% CI: 6.1-9.1), and 3.5% (95% CI: 2.6-4.8), respectively, post-RYGB, and 11.3% (95% CI: 8.5-14.9), 4.9% (95% CI: 3.1-7.6), and .9% (95% CI: .4-2.5) post-LAGB. Undergoing RYGB versus LAGB was associated with higher risk of incident AUD symptoms (adjusted hazard ratio or AHR = 2.08 [95% CI: 1.51-2.85]), illicit drug use (AHR = 1.76 [95% CI: 1.07-2.90]) and SUD treatment (AHR = 3.56 [95% CI: 1.26-10.07]). Undergoing RYGB versus LAGB was associated with twice the risk of incident AUD symptoms. One-fifth of participants reported incident AUD symptoms within 5 years post-RYGB. AUD education, screening, evaluation, and treatment referral should be incorporated in pre- and postoperative care.",10.1016/j.soard.2017.03.021,,,,755
594,Are There Ideal Small Bowel Limb Lengths for One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB) to Obtain Optimal Weight Loss and Remission of Comorbidities with Minimal Nutritional Deficiencies?,"Ideal jejunal and ileal lengths in bariatric/metabolic procedures to be left in alimentary continuity still remain unclear. We aimed to evaluate different lengths of biliopancreatic limb (BPL) and common limb (CL) performed in a series of patients submitted to OAGB, and correlate them with weight loss and nutritional deficits. A prospective observational study of 350 consecutive morbidly obese patients undergoing OAGB was performed. BPL and CL lengths were determined intraoperatively; BPL/TBL and CL/TBL ratios were then calculated. Anthropometric variables, remission of comorbidities and specific supplementation needs were recorded at 1, 2 and 5Â years after surgery. Three hundred patients were included for final analysis. BPL length and BPL/TBL ratio directly correlated with Units of BMI lost (UBMIL). Conversely, CL length and CL/TBL ratio showed an inverse correlation with UBMIL. Establishing a BMIâ€‰â‰¤â€‰25Â kg/m2 as ideal, the most accurate AUC, to predict achieving an ideal BMI at 1, 2 and 5Â years after surgery, was obtained for the CL/TBL ratio, followed by the CL length at 1, 2 and 5Â years. An ideal range was established between 0.40 and 0.43 for the CL/TBL ratio, and 200 to 220Â cm for the CL length. Among these ranges, there were no cases of protein or calorie malnutrition. TBL measurement is essential to obtain optimal outcomes after OAGB, both in terms of excellent weight loss and remission/improvement of comorbidities, as well as with a low risk of nutritional deficiencies. The CL/TBL ratio, followed by CL length, areÂ the most accurate parameters to predict a 5-year postoperative BMIâ€‰â‰¤â€‰25Â kg/m2.",10.1007/s00268-019-05243-0,,,,756
1284,Long-term effects of gastric bypass and duodenal switch on systemic exposure of atorvastatin.,"A previous study of 22 patients undergoing either gastric bypass or duodenal switch showed increased systemic exposure of atorvastatin acid 3-8 weeks after surgery in the majority of patients. This study aimed to investigate the long-term effects on systemic exposure of atorvastatin acid in the same group of patients. An 8-h pharmacokinetic investigation was performed a median of 27 months (range 21-45 months) after surgery. Systemic exposure was measured as the area under the plasma concentration versus the time curve from 0 to 8 h postdose (AUC0-8). Linear mixed models with AUC0-8 as the dependent variable were implemented to assess the effect of time, surgical procedure, and body mass index (BMI) as explanatory variables. The study enrolled 20 patients. The systemic exposure of atorvastatin acid changed significantly over time (p = 0.001), albeit there was substantial variation between subjects. The effect of time was attenuated but remained significant after adjustment for surgical procedure and BMI (p = 0.048). The initial AUC0-8 increase seen in the majority of patients 3-8 weeks after surgery was normalized long term, with 7 of the 12 gastric bypass patients and 6 of the 8 duodenal switch patients showing decreased AUC0-8 compared with preoperative values. The systemic exposure of atorvastatin showed a significant change over time after bariatric surgery, albeit with large inter- and intraindividual variations. The findings indicate that patients using atorvastatin or drugs with similar pharmacokinetic properties should be monitored closely for both therapeutic effects and adverse events the first years after gastric bypass and duodenal switch.",10.1007/s00464-012-2716-3,,,,757
1498,Virtual three-dimensional computed tomography assessment of the gastric pouch following laparoscopic Roux-Y gastric bypass.,"The construction of the gastric pouch during surgery is largely based on the prevailing dogma of Roux-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. The scarce data that exist suggest that the smaller the gastric pouch, the greater the weight loss after surgery. Current estimations of pouch volume have inherent limitations. We describe the use of virtual three-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) to assess pouch volume in the immediate postoperative period. We performed 3D CT on three patients 1 day after laparoscopic RYGB using a 16-channel multidetector CT scan. Effervescent granules were administered, along with 1 oz of water, orally to achieve gastric pouch distension. Transaxial images were transferred to the 3D workstation (Vitrea, Vital Images, Inc.) and endoluminal views of the gastric pouch were generated with perspective volume rendering. Pouch area was also measured from the standard postoperative upper gastrointestinal (UGI) contrast study. All three patients were female, with a mean preoperative body mass index (BMI) of 43.7 kg/m(2) and a mean age of 44.3 years. Mean pouch height was 4.07 cm, mean pouch width was 3.79 cm, and mean pouch depth was 2.1 cm. The mean calculated pouch volume was 31.6 cm(3). The calculated pouch area using 3D CT was statistically indistinct from the pouch area calculated using the UGI study (15.2 cm(2) vs 16.9 cm(2); p = 0.549.) For the first time, we describe the use of 3D CT to accurately measure postoperative pouch volume. In addition, we were able to confirm the utility of area (postoperative UGI) as an accurate surrogate for pouch volume.",10.1007/s11695-008-9438-6,,,,758
729,Randomized controlled trial of monopolar cautery versus clips for staple line bleeding control in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Bleeding from the staple line is a rare but serious problem following bariatric surgery. Staple line bleeding control (SLBC) can be achieved in different ways such as the application of sutures, clips, glue or buttressing materials over the staple line. Cauterization alone is generally not preferred due to concerns about debilitating the staple line. The aim of this study was to compare the clip and monopolar cauterization methods for SLBC in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. University hospital. A total of 70 morbidly obese patients were randomized into two groups. Patients with previous upper gastrointestinal surgery, re-do procedures and open surgeries were excluded. Their demographic characteristics, intraoperative and postoperative outcomes were examined. A total of 489 SLBC interventions (274 clips and 215 cauterizations) were performed after 280 stapling applications. SLBC intervention number and location, additional trocar requirement, blood loss and operation time were not different between the groups. In the clip group, two patients required monopolar cauterization when clipping failed. No intraabdominal bleeding or gastrointestinal leakage was seen in any group. Postoperative gastrointestinal hemorrhage was seen in three patients, two in the clip group and one in the cautery group. There was no difference between the groups in terms of postoperative pain score, abdominal drainage amount, hemoglobin level alteration, morbidity or length of stay. In laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, monopolar cauterization for SLBC can be used instead of clipping. It appears that monopolar cautery is a safe and effective approach for SLBC in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.",10.1016/j.ijsu.2018.09.007,,,,759
688,Quality of Life and Gastrointestinal Symptoms Following Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy: a Systematic Review.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) are the most common bariatric operations performed worldwide. Quality of life (QoL) is a crucial outcome metric. An electronic systematic search using PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science of studies comparing QoL after LSG and LRYGB was performed. QoL after both LSG and LRYGB considerably improves regardless the type of surgery. The QoL has a slight downward trend from the second to the fifth year postoperatively, but it remains higher than the baseline. LSG patients are more likely to suffer from gastroesophageal symptoms (GES). GES represent the only significant difference between the two procedures. A routine screening with gastroscopy and 24Â h pH metry to help tailor the most appropriate surgical approach is advised.",10.1007/s11695-019-03737-3,,,,760
1386,Use of staple-line reinforcement in laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery: a meta-analysis.,"This article was designed to systematically analyze the prospective, randomized, controlled trials on the effectiveness of staple-line reinforcement (SLR) in patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGBP) surgery. Trials on the effectiveness of SLR in patients undergoing LGBP surgery were selected electronic data bases and analyzed to generate summative data by using the principles of meta-analysis on statistical software package RevMan 5.0.2 provided by Cochrane Collaboration. Combined outcome of the binary variables was expressed as odds ratio (OR) and continuous variables were expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD). Three randomized, controlled trails on 180 patients qualified for inclusion. There were 91 patients in SLR group and 89 patients in non-staple-line reinforcement (NSLR) group. There was no heterogeneity among trials. In the fixed-effects model, SLR is equivalent to NSLR in terms of controlling bleeding (odds ratio (OR), 0.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.03, 3.18; zÂ =Â 0.98; PÂ <Â 0.33) from the staple-line and total number of staples used (standardized mean difference (SMD), -21.01; 95% CI, -56.46, 14.44; zÂ =Â 1.16; PÂ <Â 0.25) for anastomosis. SLR significantly reduces operative time (SMD, -0.76; 95% CI, -1.36, -0.16; zÂ =Â 2.47; PÂ <Â 0.01), perioperative complications (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.05, 0.68; zÂ =Â 2.55; PÂ <Â 0.01), anastomotic leak (OR, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.01, 0.78; zÂ =Â 2.2; PÂ <Â 0.03), and hemostatic clips (SMD, -21.01; 95% CI, -56.46, 14.44; zÂ =Â 1.16; PÂ <Â 0.25) usage. SLR seems to reduce the operative time in LGBP. In addition, SLR is associated with fewer postoperative complications, reduced incidence of anastomotic leak, and reduced requirement of hemostatic clips to control hemorrhage at the staple line. However, SLR does not have any superiority in terms of controlling staple-line bleeding and does not influence the number of staples used in LGBP.",10.1007/s00464-011-1637-x,,,,761
977,Type 2 Diabetes Remission Rates After Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass and Gastric Banding: Results of the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery Study.,"The goals of this study were to determine baseline and postbariatric surgical characteristics associated with type 2 diabetes remission and if, after controlling for differences in weight loss, diabetes remission was greater after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) than laparoscopic gastric banding (LAGB). An observational cohort of obese participants was studied using generalized linear mixed models to examine the associations of bariatric surgery type and diabetes remission rates for up to 3 years. Of 2,458 obese participants enrolled, 1,868 (76%) had complete data to assess diabetes status at both baseline and at least one follow-up visit. Of these, 627 participants (34%) were classified with diabetes: 466 underwent RYGBP and 140 underwent LAGB. After 3 years, 68.7% of RYGBP and 30.2% of LAGB participants were in diabetes remission. Baseline factors associated with diabetes remission included a lower weight for LAGB, greater fasting C-peptide, lower leptin-to-fat mass ratio for RYGBP, and a lower hemoglobin A1c without need for insulin for both procedures. After both procedures, greater postsurgical weight loss was associated with remission. However, even after controlling for differences in amount of weight lost, relative diabetes remission rates remained nearly twofold higher after RYGBP than LAGB. Diabetes remission up to 3 years after RYGBP and LAGB was proportionally higher with increasing postsurgical weight loss. However, the nearly twofold greater weight loss-adjusted likelihood of diabetes remission in subjects undergoing RYGBP than LAGB suggests unique mechanisms contributing to improved glucose metabolism beyond weight loss after RYGBP.",10.2337/dc15-2138,,,,762
82,The Prevalence of Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB): a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"We reviewed the literature on the prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Eight studies examining 893 patients were included. The mean age of the patients was 48.11â€‰Â±â€‰4.89Â years. The mean BMI before surgery and at the time of SIBO diagnosis was 44.57â€‰Â±â€‰2.89Â kg/m2 and 31.53â€‰Â±â€‰2.29Â kg/m2, respectively. Moreover, the results showed a 29% and 53% prevalence of SIBO atâ€‰<â€‰3-year andâ€‰>â€‰3-year follow-up after RYGB, respectively. Symptoms included abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloating, nausea, vomiting, constipation, soft stool, frequent defecation, flatulence, rumpling, dumping syndrome, and irritable bowel syndrome. SIBO is prevalent after RYGB; digestive symptoms should prompt the consideration of SIBO as a potential etiology. Antibiotic therapy has proven to be therapeutic.",10.1007/s11695-023-06974-9,,,,763
1028,Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass lead to equal changes in body composition and energy metabolism 17 months postoperatively: a prospective randomized trial.,"Weight loss is the sum of fat and lean mass loss. The aim of this study was to examine whether there are differences between 2 surgical procedures, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), in terms of their effect on body composition and energy metabolism. In addition, the predictive value of preoperative body composition and energy metabolism on postoperative outcome was evaluated. All procedures were performed by the same surgeon (RP) at the St. Claraspital Basel in Switzerland. Calorimetry and DEXA were carried out at the same institution (Interdisciplinary Center of Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases, St. Claraspital Basel). Forty-two morbidly obese, mainly female (85%), nondiabetic and diabetic (50%) patients (body mass index [BMI]: 43.9 kg/m(2)Â±1.3) before and 17Â±5.6 months after LSG (n = 23) and LRYGB (n = 19) were examined. Body composition was analyzed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and resting energy expenditure (REE); fat and carbohydrate oxidation was determined by indirect calorimetry. Follow-up was 100%. Excessive BMI loss (EBMIL) was 64.4% in the LSG group and 76.4% in the LRYGB group (P<.046). In both groups total fat and muscle mass decreased significantly compared with baseline (P<.001) and the percentage of muscle mass per kilogram of weight increased postoperatively (results not significant). REE decreased (P<.001) and REE per kilogram of weight increased significantly (P<.003) compared with baseline. Carbohydrate oxidation remained stable in both groups, and fat oxidation decreased significantly (P<.001) compared with baseline. In diabetic patients compared with nondiabetic patients there were no statistically significant differences in REE, substrate oxidation, or reduction in truncal fat. Postoperatively, lean mass was higher in diabetic patients (P = .037). Preoperative indirect calorimetry and DEXA results were of no predictive value for outcome. Changes in REE and body composition were equal after both procedures in a bariatric population mainly consisting of women. No predictors for amount of weight loss could be found.",10.1016/j.soard.2015.07.002,,,,764
229,Single Versus Double Anastomosis Duodenal Switch in the Management of Obesity: A Meta-analysis and Systematic Review.,"Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) is an effective yet technically challenging bariatric surgery with many complications. Alternatively, single anastomosis duodenal-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S) was recently introduced as a simplified bariatric procedure. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of SADI-S compared with BPD-DS in the management of patients with obesity. Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for articles from their inception to May 2022 by 2 independent reviewers using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis system. The review was registered prospectively with PROSPERO (CRD42022333521). From 123 studies screened, 6 studies met the eligibility criteria, with a total of 1847 patients with obesity undergoing either SADI-S (n=818) or BPD-DS (n=1029). Preoperative body mass index was similar between the 2 groups, and the BPD-DS group had a greater % excess body mass index loss (EBMIL) (MD=-10.16%, 95% confidence interval: -11.80, -8.51, I 2 =0%) at 2 years compared with the SADI-S group. There was no difference observed in preoperative comorbidities and remission, including diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia between SADI-S and BPD-DS cohorts. Compared with BPD-DS, SADI-S had shorter hospital stays (MD=-1.36Â d, 95% CI: -2.39, -0.33, I 2 =86%), and fewer long-term (>30Â d) complications (OR=0.56, 95% CI: 0.42, 0.74, I 2 =20%). Conversely, among nutritional deficiency outcomes, the SADI-S group had few patients with abnormal vitamin D (OR=0.51, 95% CI: 0.36, 0.72, I 2 =0%) values than the BPD-DS group. SADI-S has shown to be a possible alternative treatment option to BPD-DS in managing patients with obesity. Despite the promising results, further randomized controlled studies with more extended follow-up periods are necessary to ascertain the safety and efficacy of the treatment.",10.1097/SLE.0000000000001102,,,,765
690,Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of the Change in Ghrelin Levels After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is considered effective for weight loss and for treatment of many obesity-related metabolic diseases. Ghrelin is an essential orexigenic peptide that plays an indispensable role in controlling body weight and energy homeostasis of post-operative patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate changes in the level of fasting total ghrelin following RYGB. A systematic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library until April 2018 with keywords ""ghrelin"" and ""gastric bypass"" was performed in accordance with the MOOSE guidelines and PRISMA statement. Three reviewers independently selected the studies and extracted data. Quality assessment of the included studies was undergone. A random effects model was employed to calculate overall effect sizes. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were subsequently performed. Sixteen studies with 325 patients were included. We found ghrelin levels had an increasing tendency (SMDâ€‰=â€‰0.30; 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.04 to 0.57) despite moderate heterogeneity (I2â€‰=â€‰58%). Subsequent subgroup analysis indicated that ghrelin levels decreased (SMDâ€‰=â€‰-â€‰0.49; 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰-â€‰0.98 to 0.00) in the short term (â‰¤â€‰3Â months) and increased (SMDâ€‰=â€‰0.46; 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.22 to 0.69) in the long term (>â€‰3Â months) after RYGB. Meta-regression showed that gastric pouch volume, alimentary limb length and biliopancreatic limb length were not associated with changes in ghrelin levels. Fasting total ghrelin levels decreased in the short term (â‰¤â€‰3Â months) and increased in the long term (>â€‰3Â months) after RYGB.",10.1007/s11695-018-03686-3,,,,766
1207,The role of drainage after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity: a systematic review.,"Intraperitoneal drainage after gastrointestinal surgery is still routinely used in many hospitals. The objective of this study was to determine the evidence-based value of routine drainage after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). An electronic search of the MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Embase databases from 2002 to 2012 was performed to identify articles analyzing the use of drainage after RYGB, its efficacy in determining the presence of an anastomotic leak, and its role in nonoperative treatment of the leakage. Eighteen articles were identified: 6 nonrandomized prospective cohort studies, 1 cohort retrospective study that compared routine drainage versus no drainage, 11 retrospective cohort studies, and no randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The sensitivity of drainage in detecting postoperative leakage varied between 0% and 94.1% in 10 articles (3 prospective and 6 retrospective) reporting data about this matter. The efficacy of drainage for the nonoperative treatment of postoperative leakage could be estimated in 11 articles (5 prospective and 6 retrospective) and varied between 12.5% and 100%. Only 2 studies reported data about nonoperative treatment of leakage without drainage, which was pursued in 0% and 33% of patients, respectively. Evidence-based recommendations on the use of drainage after RYGB cannot be given. Without RCTs, the value of routine drainage cannot be ascertained.",10.1016/j.soard.2013.09.008,,,,767
1568,"Heated and humidified insufflation during laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery: effect on temperature, postoperative pain, and recovery outcomes.","Controversy exists regarding the efficacy of heated and humidified intraperitoneal gases in maintaining core body temperature. We performed a sham-controlled study to test the hypothesis that active warming and humidification of the insufflation gas reduces intraoperative heat loss and improves recovery outcomes. Fifty morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedures using a standardized anesthetic technique were randomly assigned to either a control (sham) group receiving room temperature insufflation gases with an inactive Insuflow (Lexion Medical, St. Paul, MN) device, or an active (Insuflow) group receiving warmed and humidified intraperitoneal gases. Esophageal and/or tympanic membrane temperature was measured perioperatively. Postoperative pain was assessed at 15 minute intervals using an 11-point verbal rating scale, with 0 = none to 10 = maximal. In addition, postoperative opioid requirements, incidence of nausea and vomiting, as well as the quality of recovery, were recorded. Use of the active Insuflow device was associated with significantly higher mean +/- standard deviation (SD) intraoperative core body temperatures (35.5 +/- 0.5 vs. 35.0 +/- 0.4 degrees C). Postoperative shivering (0 vs. 19%) and the requirement for morphine in the postanesthesia care unit (5 +/- 4 vs. 10 +/- 5 mg) were both significantly lower in the Insuflow vs. control groups. Patients in the Insuflow group also reported a higher quality of recovery 48 hours after surgery (15 vs. 13, P < 0.05). The Insuflow device modestly reduced shivering and heat loss, as well as the need for opioid analgesics in the early postoperative period. However, it failed to improve laparoscopic visualization due to fogging, and provided improvement in the quality of recovery only on postoperative day 2.",10.1089/lap.2005.15.6,,,,768
1499,"Enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis in gastric bypass patients: extended duration, dose stratification, and antifactor Xa activity.","Morbidly obese patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery are at risk for postoperative venous thromboembolism. Evidence-based recommendations regarding the dosing and duration of thromboprophylaxis are lacking for morbidly obese surgical patients. The aims of this study were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an extended duration, body mass index (BMI)-stratified enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis regimen in patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and to determine the resultant antifactor Xa (AFXa) activity in morbidly obese surgical patients. In this prospective open trial, 223 patients (75% female, mean BMI 50.4 kg/m2) undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were assigned to receive enoxaparin 40 mg (BMI <or=50 kg/m2), n = 124) or 60 mg (BMI >50 kg/m2), n = 99) every 12 hours during hospitalization and once daily for 10 days after discharge. The AFXa levels were monitored serially, and dose adjustments were made for results outside the target prophylactic range (.2-.4 IU/mL +/- 10%) after the third dose. The safety and efficacy outcomes were major bleeding and venous thromboembolism. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was performed laparoscopically in 208 subjects (93%). The duration of surgery averaged 99.5 +/- 31 minutes, and the median length of hospitalization was 3 days. Target prophylactic AFXa concentration was achieved by 74% of patients after the third enoxaparin dose; none reached the full anticoagulation concentration. One patient developed nonfatal venous thromboembolism (.45%). Four patients required transfusion (1.79%). Bleeding was not associated with a high AFXa concentration. This BMI-stratified, extended enoxaparin dosing regimen provided well-tolerated, effective prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery.",10.1016/j.soard.2007.11.010,,,,769
1509,Double-balloon ERCP in patients who have undergone Roux-en-Y surgery: a case series.,"ERCP is technically challenging in patients who have had a long-limb Roux-en-Y surgical procedure. The recent introduction of the double-balloon endoscope permits the examination of a much longer segment of the small bowel compared with a standard endoscope and may be used to perform ERCP in these patients. To report successful use of double-balloon ERCP in patients who have had a Roux-en-Y surgical procedure. Fourteen patients with a history of either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass weight-reduction surgery or Roux-en-Y pancreatobiliary surgery required diagnostic and/or therapeutic pancreatobiliary intervention. Case report. Double-balloon ERCP. Fourteen patients underwent a total of 20 ERCPs with the double-balloon endoscopy system. The ampulla was successfully reached in 85% of total cases (100% of patients who have had Roux-en-Y weight reduction surgery), with adequate cannulation of either the biliary or pancreatic duct in 80% (88% of patients for weight reduction). Therapeutic intervention, including stone removal, pancreatobiliary-duct dilation, sphincterotomy, stent placement, and removal of previously placed stents, was performed successfully in 6 cases. The mean age was 47 years old. The mean (+/- standard deviation) total duration of the procedure was 99 +/- 48 minutes. There were no immediate or short-term complications. The double-balloon endoscopy system permits diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP in patients who have had long-limb surgical procedures. Our experience demonstrated that this procedure is well tolerated, safe, and has a high success rate.",10.1016/j.gie.2007.06.056,,,,770
1169,Systematic review of economic evaluation of laparotomy versus laparoscopy for patients submitted to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Because of the high prevalence of obesity, there is a growing demand for bariatric surgery worldwide. The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the difference in relation to cost-effectiveness of access route by laparoscopy versus laparotomy of Roux en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). A systematic review was conducted in the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane and Lilacs in order to identify economic evaluation studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic and laparotomic routes in RYGB. In a total of 494 articles, only 6 fulfilled the eligibility criteria. All studies were published between 2001 and 2008 in the United States (USA). Three studies fulfilled less than half of the items that evaluated the results quality; two satisfied 5 of the required items, and only 1 study fulfilled 7 of 10 items. The economic evaluation of studies alternated between cost-effectiveness and cost-consequence. Five studies considered the surgery by laparoscopy the dominant strategy, because it showed greater clinical benefit (less probability of post-surgical complications, less hospitalization time) and lower total cost. This review indicates that laparoscopy is a safe and well-tolerated technique, despite the costs of surgery being higher when compared with laparotomy. However, the additional costs are compensated by the lower probability of complications after surgery and, consequently, avoiding their costs.",10.1371/journal.pone.0099976,,,,771
1492,"Weight loss, appetite suppression, and changes in fasting and postprandial ghrelin and peptide-YY levels after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy: a prospective, double blind study.","Bariatric surgery is currently the most effective treatment in morbidly obese patients, leading to durable weight loss. In this prospective double blind study, we aim to evaluate and compare the effects of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP) with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) on body weight, appetite, fasting, and postprandial ghrelin and peptide-YY (PYY) levels. After randomization, 16 patients were assigned to LRYGBP and 16 patients to LSG. Patients were reevaluated on the 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 12th postoperative month. Blood samples were collected after an overnight fast and in 6 patients in each group after a standard 420 kcal mixed meal. Body weight and body mass index (BMI) decreased markedly (P < 0.0001) and comparably after either procedure. Excess weight loss was greater after LSG at 6 months (55.5% +/- 7.6% vs. 50.2% +/- 6.5%, P = 0.04) and 12 months (69.7% +/- 14.6% vs. 60.5% +/- 10.7%, [P = 0.05]). After LRYGBP fasting ghrelin levels did not change significantly compared with baseline (P = 0.19) and did not decrease significantly after the test meal. On the other hand, LSG was followed by a marked reduction in fasting ghrelin levels (P < 0.0001) and a significant suppression after the meal. Fasting PYY levels increased after either surgical procedure (P < or = 0.001). Appetite decreased in both groups but to a greater extend after LSG. PYY levels increased similarly after either procedure. The markedly reduced ghrelin levels in addition to increased PYY levels after LSG, are associated with greater appetite suppression and excess weight loss compared with LRYGBP.",10.1097/SLA.0b013e318156f012,,,,772
1378,Training programs influence in the learning curve of laparoscopic gastric bypass for morbid obesity: a systematic review.,"The makeup of a new surgical bariatric team may be associated with a higher number of postoperative complications due to the learning curve. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes during the learning curve of laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGBP) depending on surgeons' training. A systematic approach was used to review studies from the Pubmed, Embase (Ovid), Cancer Lit, Biomes Central via Scirus, Current Contens (ISI), and Web of Science (SCI) databases. Two reviewers independently screened all titles/abstracts and included/excluded studies based on full copies of manuscripts. The outcomes included were: specific training of the surgeon, postoperative complications (leaks, occlusion, hemorrhage, pneumonia, etc.), mortality, and surgical technique. One reviewer put data onto an Excel spreadsheet. Statistical analysis was performed with weighted linear regression. We identified 448 citations, of which 120 abstract and 50 full-text publications were reviewed. Fourteen papers were selected. Data from 1,848 patients were included. Eighteen different surgeons were analyzed during their learning curve (including the first author of this study). Surgeons were divided into two groups: (1) without formal laparoscopic bariatric training (13 surgeons) and (2) with formal laparoscopic bariatric training (five surgeons). Postoperative complications were more frequent in group 1: 18.1% (Â± 7.6) vs. 7.7% (Â± 1.96, p = 0.046); also, mortality was more frequent in group 1: 0.57% (Â± 0.87) vs. 0% (p = 0.05). An appropriated training in laparoscopic bariatric surgery contributes to a significant reduction in postoperative complications and mortality during the learning curve of LGBP.",10.1007/s11695-011-0398-x,,,,773
1155,Improvement in health-related quality of life following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"This study explored whether health-related quality of life (HRQOL) changes following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery were associated with identifiable socio-demographic or clinical characteristics, and it examined the impact on health outcomes of changes in the Danish criteria for bariatric surgery. Participants (n = 55) completed the Short Form Health Survey v2 (SF-36) before and 22 Â± 4.2 months after surgery. Information on socio-demographics, body mass index (BMI), co-morbidity and satisfaction with surgery were collected through patient questionnaires and hospital records. There was overall improvement on all SF-36 subscales and in the mean physical score (PCS) and mean mental score (MCS) (p = 0.001). A total of five patients had lower PCS and 13 patients had lower MCS after surgery, but we identified no particular characteristics associated with this poorer outcome. Co-morbidity and preoperative PCS/MCS showed a strong correlation with change in PCS/MCS score. Gastric bypass had a positive overall effect on HRQOL, but further investigation of individual variations is needed. We found no significant differences in HRQOL outcome between those patients who would be accepted for bariatric surgery under the current Danish criteria for bariatric surgery and those patients who only fulfilled the criteria for bariatric surgery before 2011. not relevant.

854,Health-Related Quality-of-Life after Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass Surgery with or Without Closure of the Mesenteric Defects: a Post-hoc Analysis of Data from a Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Mesenteric defect closure in laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery has been reported to reduce the risk for small bowel obstruction. Little is known, however, about the effect of mesenteric defect closure on patient-reported outcome. The aim of the present study was to see if mesenteric defect closure affects health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) after laparoscopic gastric bypass. Patients operated at 12 centers for bariatric surgery participated in this randomized two-arm parallel study. During the operation, patients were randomized to closure of the mesenteric defects or non-closure. This study was a post-hoc analysis comparing HRQoL of the two groups before surgery, at 1 and 2Â years after the operation. HRQoL was estimated using the short form 36 (SF-36-RAND) and the obesity problems (OP) scale. Between May 1, 2010, and November 14, 2011, 2507 patients were included in the study and randomly assigned to mesenteric defect closure (nÂ =Â 1259) or non-closure (nÂ =Â 1248). In total, 1619 patients (64.6%) reported on their HRQoL at the 2-year follow-up. Mesenteric defect closure was associated with slightly higher rating of social functioning (87Â Â±Â 22.1 vs. 85Â Â±Â 24.2, pÂ =Â 0.047) and role emotional (85Â Â±Â 31.5 vs. 82Â Â±Â 35.0, pÂ =Â 0.027). No difference was seen on the OP scale (open defects 22Â Â±Â 24.8 vs. closed defects 20Â Â±Â 23.8, pÂ =Â 0.125). When comparing mesenteric defect closure with non-closure, there is no clinically relevant difference in HRQoL after laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery.",10.1007/s11695-017-2798-z,,,,775
1456,Probiotics improve outcomes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery: a prospective randomized trial.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RNYGB) surgery offers an effective and enduring treatment for morbid obesity. Gastric bypass may alter gastrointestinal (GI) flora possibly resulting in bacterial overgrowth and dysmotility. Our hypothesis was that daily use of probiotics would improve GI outcomes after RNYGB. Forty-four patients undergoing RNYGB were randomized to either a probiotic or control group; 2.4 billion colonies of Lactobacillus were administered daily postoperatively to the probiotic group. The outcomes of H(2) levels indicative of bacterial overgrowth, GI-related quality of life (GIQoL), serologies, and weight loss were measured preoperatively and at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Categorical variables were analyzed by chi(2) test and continuous variables were analyzed by t test with a p < 0.05 for significance. At 6 months, a statistically significant reduction in bacterial overgrowth was achieved in the probiotic group with a preoperative to postoperative change of sum H(2) part per million (probiotics = -32.13, controls = 0.80). Surprisingly, the probiotic group attained significantly greater percent excess weight loss than that of control group at 6 weeks (controls = 25.5%, probiotic = 29.9%) and 3 months (38.55%, 47.68%). This trend also continued but was not significant at 6 months (60.78%, 67.15%). The probiotic group had significantly higher postoperative vitamin B12 levels than the control group. Both probiotic and control groups significantly improved their GIQoL. In this novel study, probiotic administration improves bacterial overgrowth, vitamin B12 availability, and weight loss after RNYGB. These data may provide further evidence that altering the GI microbiota can influence weight loss.",10.1007/s11605-009-0891-x,,,,776
491,Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for quality of life: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) are the mainstays of bariatric surgery in recent years. In addition, there has been an increased interest in the quality of life (QoL) of obese patients after surgery. This study examined the QoL of patients who had undergone either LSG or LRYGB. We retrieved the literature from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library database before November 2019. A total of 10 articles and 2327 obese patients were included in our meta-analysis. The QoL scoring tools included in the statistical analysis are the following: the gastrointestinal quality of life index, 36-items short-form health survey, bariatric analysis and reporting outcome system, and the Moorehead-Ardelt quality of life questionnaire II. Although the QoL score of the LRYGB group was higher than that of the LSG group in the bariatric analysis and reporting outcome system subgroup, statistical analysis showed no difference in the postoperative QoL of LSG and LRYGB. In our study, no difference was found in the QoL between LSG and LRYGB. Therefore, in terms of postoperative QoL, surgical methods should be selected on the basis of the patients' condition and level of understanding of the surgeries.",10.1016/j.soard.2020.06.022,,,,777
1086,Blood Metabolome Changes Before and After Bariatric Surgery: A (1)H NMR-Based Clinical Investigation.,"Excessive body fat and obesity have adverse health effects and result in significant morbidity such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. The health burden of obesity can be reduced with the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) weight-loss bariatric surgery. Little is known on the molecular changes that occur at the metabolome level before and after bariatric surgery, with a view to clinical biomarker development. Hence, we employed a metabolomics approach in 10 obese diabetic patients who underwent bariatric surgery. Metabolomics data were obtained by T2- and diffusion-edited hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR) spectra to monitor the metabolic and lipoprotein profiles, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (CG-MS) to access the fatty acid profile before and 12 months after RYGB. Using hierarchical partial least squares discriminant analysis, we found that RYGB induces several key metabolic alterations associated with glucose homeostasis, as well as fatty acid and amino acid metabolism. The levels of lactate (Krebs' intermediate cycle) decreased after RYGB. The leucine, isoleucine, valine, lactate, and glucose levels were higher in the samples before RYGB (p<0.05). Additionally, the levels of very low-density lipoprotein, unsaturated lipids, and N-acetyl-glycoprotein were higher before RYGB. By contrast, levels of the high-density lipoprotein and phosphatidylcholine were higher after bariatric surgery. These results collectively offer important holistic integrative biology data to develop future clinically relevant metabolomics biomarkers related to bariatric surgery in connection with obesity.",10.1089/omi.2015.0009,,,,778
44,Short-term effects of obesity surgery versus low-energyÂ diet on body composition and tissue-specific glucose uptake: a randomised clinical study using whole-body integrated 18F-FDG-PET/MRI.,"Obesity surgery (OS) and diet-induced weight loss rapidly improve insulin resistance. We aim to investigate the impact of either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) surgery compared with a diet low in energy (low-calorie diet; LCD) on body composition, glucose control and insulin sensitivity, assessed both at the global and tissue-specific level in individuals with obesity but not diabetes. In this parallel group randomised controlled trial, patients on a waiting list for OS were randomised (no blinding, sealed envelopes) to either undergo surgery directly or undergo an LCD before surgery. At baseline and 4 weeks after surgery (n=15, 11 RYGB and 4 SG) or 4 weeks after the start of LCD (n=9), investigations were carried out, including an OGTT and hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps during which concomitant simultaneous whole-body [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET)/MRI was performed. The primary outcome was HOMA-IR change. One month after bariatric surgery and initiation of LCD, both treatments induced similar reductions in body weight (mean Â± SD: -7.7Â±1.4 kg and -7.4Â±2.2 kg, respectively), adipose tissue volume (7%) and liver fat content (2% units). HOMA-IR, a main endpoint, was significantly reduced following OS (-26.3% [95% CI -49.5, -3.0], p=0.009) and non-significantly following LCD (-20.9% [95% CI -58.2, 16.5). For both groups, there were similar reductions in triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol. Fasting plasma glucose and insulin were also significantly reduced only following OS. There was an increase in glucose AUC in response to an OGTT in the OS group (by 20%) but not in the LCD group. During hyperinsulinaemia, only the OS group showed a significantly increased PET-derived glucose uptake rate in skeletal muscle but a reduced uptake in the heart and abdominal adipose tissue. Both liver and brain glucose uptake rates were unchanged after surgery or LCD. Whole-body glucose disposal and endogenous glucose production were not significantly affected. The short-term metabolic effects seen 4 weeks after OS are not explained by loss of body fat alone. Thus OS, but not LCD, led to reductions in fasting plasma glucose and insulin resistance as well as to distinct changes in insulin-stimulated glucose fluxes to different tissues. Such effects may contribute to the prevention or reversal of type 2 diabetes following OS. Moreover, the full effects on whole-body insulin resistance and plasma glucose require a longer time than 4 weeks.

437,[Weight regain after bariatric surgery in diabetic patients at a university hospital in Argentina].,"bariatric surgery has proven to be the most effective treatment for weight reduction. The weight regain is expected in any type of surgery, and within them, the roux en Y gastric by pass (GBP) appears to be the one with the lowest weight increase compared to sleeve gastrectomy (SG). it was an observational retrospective cohort study. 167 patients undergoing bariatric surgery, GBP and SG, were analyzed between 2012 and 2017. Patients older than 18 years with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity were selected. The main variable, weight (kg), was measured longitudinally at 6 months,1 and 5 years. it was detected that there was weight regain between the first and fifth postoperative year with both techniques used but it was significantly for SG. both types of surgeries achieved significant weight loss, however the regimen existed and was significant for the SG group.",10.31053/1853.0605.v77.n4.28131,,,,780
1431,Erectile dysfunction and hormonal imbalance in morbidly obese male is reversed after gastric bypass surgery: a prospective randomized controlled trial.,"The effects of weight loss on erectile function and hormones have not been well studied. The aim of this study was to measure the degree to which sexual function and in particular erectile function and hormonal environment change after substantial weight loss, surgically and non-surgically induced in the morbidly obese male in a prospective randomized long-term controlled trial. Furthermore, how surgery makes a difference when treating morbidly obese men was envisaged in this context. We prospectively studied 20 morbidly obese men for 24 months, divided into two groups: group A included 10 patients who underwent life style modifications (exercise and diet) for 4 months and subsequently gastric bypass, and another 10 patients in group B were kept on weekly follow-up. None of the men were taking phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors. All patients underwent International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-5 questionnaire, serum oestradiol, prolactin (PRL), luteinizing (LH) and follicle-stimulating (FSH) hormones, free and total testosterone (FT and TT) at baseline (time 0), surgery - 4 months latter baseline (time 1) and final evaluation - 24 months (time 2). From times 0 to 1, group A presented a mean body mass index (BMI) reduction of 12.6 (p < 0.0001), whereas group B, 2.1 (p > 0.05). The BMI reductions between times 0 and 2 were 24.7 (p < 0.0001) and 0.7 (p > 0.05) for groups A and B respectively. BMI average between the two groups was similar at time 0 (p = 0.2142), and different at times 1 (p = 0.0033) and 2 (p < 0.0006). Increase in IIEF-5 score (p = 0.0469), TT (p = 0.0349) and FSH levels (p = 0.0025), and reduction in PRL level (p < 0.0001) were observed in group A from times 0 to 2 and 1 to 2. There were no changes from times 0 to 1. Comparing groups A and B at time 2, IIEF-5, TT and FT increased significantly in group A (p = 0.0224, 0.0043 and 0.0149 respectively). Surgery-induced weight loss increased erectile function quality measured by IIEF-5 questionnaire, increased TT, FT and FSH and reduced PRL levels. The hormonal impact verified could justify the improvement in erectile function. Lifestyle modifications impacted BMI without hormonal or sexual impact in morbidly obese. New studies are warranted in the field to support our data.",10.1111/j.1365-2605.2009.01017.x,,,,781
1264,Endoluminal revision of gastric bypass for weight regain--a systematic review.,"Weight recidivism after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is a challenging problem for patients and bariatric surgeons alike. Traditional operative strategies to combat weight regain are technically challenging and associated with a high morbidity rate. Endoluminal interventions are thus an attractive alternative that may offer a good combination of results coupled with lower periprocedure risk that might one day provide a solution to this increasingly prevalent problem. The purpose of this article is to systematically review the available literature on endoluminal procedures used to address weight regain after RYGB, with specific attention to the safety profile, efficacy, cost, and current availability. This review focuses only on endoluminal procedures that are performed for weight regain after RYGB, as opposed to primary endoluminal obesity procedures. This study was a retrospective review. Several methods of endoluminal intervention for weight regain are reviewed, ranging from injection of inert substances to suturing and clipping devices. The literature review shows the procedures on the whole to be well tolerated with limited efficacy. The majority of the literature is limited to small case series. Most of the reviewed devices are no longer commercially available. Endoluminal therapy represents an intriguing strategy for weight regain after RYGB. However, the current and future technologies must be rigorously studied and improved such that they offer durable, repeatable, cost-effective solutions.",10.1016/j.soard.2013.03.001,,,,782
1077,Clinical Benefit of Gastric Staple Line Reinforcement (SLR) in Gastrointestinal Surgery: a Meta-analysis.,"The objective of this study was to assess whether the use of staple line reinforcement (SLR) reduces staple line complications (SLC). Mechanical staple lines are essential for gastrointestinal surgery such as bariatric surgery. However, SLC, such as bleeding and leakage, still occur. The purposes of this study were to provide quantitative evidence on the relative efficacy of gastric SLR and to compare the rates of effectiveness of three commonly used methods. A search of the medical literature in English language journals identified studies from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2013, using the following reinforcement types: (1) no reinforcement, (2) oversewing, (3) a biocompatible glycolide copolymer, and (4) bovine pericardium after gastric bypasses and sleeve gastrectomies. Types of reinforcement were compared using a random-effects model. This meta-analysis reviewed 16,967 articles, extracting data on 56,309 patients concerning leak and 41,864 patients concerning bleeding. Over 40 % of patients had no reinforcement, resulting in the highest leak rate (2.75 %) and bleed rate (3.45 %). Overall, reinforcing with bovine pericardium had the lowest leak (1.28 %) and bleed (1.23 %) rates. Suture oversewing was better than no reinforcement but not as effective as bovine pericardium for leak (2.45 %) and bleed (2.69 %) rates. Buttressing with a biocompatible glycolide copolymer resulted in the second highest leak rate (2.61 %) and a bleed rate of 2.48 % but had significantly lower bleed rates than no reinforcement. SLR provided superior results for patients compared to no reinforcement for reducing SLC. Buttressing with bovine pericardium resulted in the most favorable outcomes. The effectiveness of different methods used to reinforce the staple line in gastric surgery does not appear to be equal.",10.1007/s11695-015-1703-x,,,,783
207,Scores for Predicting Diabetes Remission in Bariatric Surgery: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"This systematic review aims to compare the accuracy of pre-existent scores predicting diabetes remission after bariatric and metabolic surgery. Among the scores, DiaBetter presented the largest area under the curve (AUC) (0.87; 95% CI, 0.84-0.9). Ad-DiaRem had the lowest AUC (0.79; 95% CI, 0.76-0.83). Ad-DiaRem showed the highest sensitivity (91%; 95% CI, 86-96%), with a specificity of 71.23% (95% CI 50.43 to 92.06%). IMS showed a sensitivity of 59% (95% CI, 20-90%), with the highest specificity (86%; 95% CI, 69-94%). Clinicians should associate the findings of the present review with patients' individual characteristics to help predict diabetes remission and evaluate the probability of the patient benefit from surgery.",10.1007/s11695-022-06382-5,,,,784
37,The Safety and Efficacy of Concurrent Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy during Minimally Invasive Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: A Systematic Review.,"We conducted a systematic review to examine perioperative outcomes for adults undergoing minimally invasive Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) with and without concurrent cholecystectomy (CCE). We reviewed the literature using OVID MEDLINE(R), Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and medRxiv and identified studies published between 1946 and May 2023. We identified a total of 2402 studies with 11 included in the final analysis (combined 149,356 patients). Studies suggested increased operative time associated with RYGB-CCE, with mixed results regarding length of stay and rates of bile duct injury. Presently available data is not robust enough to conclude whether minimally invasive RYGB with CCE harms or benefits patients compared to RYGB alone.",10.1007/s11695-024-07270-w,,,,785
502,Lipoprotein insulin resistance score in nondiabetic patients with obesity after bariatric surgery.,"Lipoprotein insulin resistance (LPIR) score is a composite biomarker representative of atherogenic dyslipidemia characteristic of early insulin resistance. It is elevated in obesity and may provide information not captured in glycosylated hemoglobin and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance. While bariatric surgery reduces diabetes incidence and resolves metabolic syndrome, the effect of bariatric surgery on LPIR is untested. We sought to assess the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy on LPIR in nondiabetic women with obesity. Nonsmoking, nondiabetic, premenopausal Hispanic women, age â‰¥18 years, undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy at Bellevue Hospital were recruited for a prospective observational study. Anthropometric measures and blood sampling were performed preoperatively and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. LPIR was measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Among 53 women (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, n = 22; sleeve gastrectomy, n = 31), mean age was 32 Â± 7 years and body mass index 44.1 Â± 6.4 kg/m2. LPIR was reduced by 35 Â± 4% and 46 Â± 4% at 6 and 12 months after surgery, respectively, with no difference by procedure. Twenty-seven of 53 patients met International Diabetes Federation criteria for metabolic syndrome preoperatively and had concomitant higher homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance, glycosylated hemoglobin, nonhigh-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and LPIR. Twenty-five of 27 patients experienced resolution of metabolic syndrome postoperatively. Concordantly, the preoperative differences in homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance, glycosylated hemoglobin, and nonhigh-density lipoprotein-cholesterol between those with and without metabolic syndrome resolved at 6 and 12 months. In contrast, patients with metabolic syndrome preoperatively exhibited greater LPIR scores at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. This is the first study to demonstrate improvement in insulin resistance, as measured by LPIR, after bariatric surgery with no difference by procedure. This measure, but not traditional markers, was persistently higher in patients with a preoperative metabolic syndrome diagnosis, despite resolution of the condition.",10.1016/j.soard.2020.05.008,,,,786
241,"Effect of probiotic supplementation on plasma metabolite profile after Roux-Y gastric bypass: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.","There is evidence that metabolic profile changes after Roux-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), especially due to modifications in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, previous studies have suggested that probiotics can modify the microbiome and produce metabolites important for metabolic health maintenance. In this sense, the aim of this study was to verify the influence of probiotic supplementation on the plasma metabolite profile after RYGB. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted with 31 patients subjected to RYGB surgery, randomized in probiotic group that was supplemented with a probiotic supplement (FloraVantageÂ®) for 3 months after surgery or a placebo group. Plasma metabonomics was performed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at the preoperative period (T0) and at 45-50 days (T1) and 90-95 days (T2) during the postoperative period/intervention. Reductions in trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) and alanine were observed in both groups, however this reduction was greater in the probiotic group (TMAO 13.82%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.01 and alanine 14.03%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.03) at T2. Additionally, Î²-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels increased 10.77% in the probiotic group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.03) compared to the placebo group at T2. Supplementation with Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07 was able to associate with significant differences in relevant plasma metabolites associated with improved metabolic health.",10.1038/s41366-022-01213-0,,,,787
964,"Risk of nephrolithiasis, hyperoxaluria, and calcium oxalate supersaturation increased after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","Earlier publications have shown renal stone complications after bariatric surgery. Multiple reports have also linked metabolic changes that alter the urinary chemistry profiles, especially hyperoxaluria, after bariatric surgery. However, evidence on change of other urine chemistry studies and type of bariatric surgery and risk of stone has been inconclusive so far. To explore the association between bariatric surgery and postoperative urinary chemistry change and risk of stone formation SETTING: A systematic review and meta-analysis. We comprehensively searched the databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from their dates of inception to January 2016. The inclusion criteria were published studies of association between bariatric surgery and postoperative renal stone formation or urine chemistry profiles. We used random-effects model meta-analysis and calculated the pooled risk of renal stone and difference in 24-hour urine chemistry profiles. Twelve observational studies were included in the meta-analysis. There was significantly higher risk of stone formation after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery with pooled relative risk = 1.79 (95% CI: 1.54-2.10). In the analysis of urine chemistry profiles, there was significantly higher calcium oxalate supersaturation, lower citrate, and lower volume postoperatively compared with preoperatively. There was also higher urine oxalate in patients who had bariatric surgery compared with nonsurgery controls. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery is associated with higher risk of renal stone and increased urine oxalate and calcium oxalate supersaturation.",10.1016/j.soard.2016.04.004,,,,788
495,Ursodeoxycholic acid for the prevention of symptomatic gallstone disease after bariatric surgery: statistical analysis plan for a randomised controlled trial (UPGRADE trial).,"Approximately 8-15% of patients undergoing bariatric surgery develop symptomatic gallstone disease within 24â€‰months after surgery. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) seems to effectively prevent the formation of gallstones detectable by ultrasound after bariatric surgery. The aim of the UPGRADE trial is to provide evidence on the prophylactic use of UDCA in preventing symptomatic gallstone disease postoperatively. The UPGRADE trial is designed as a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind multicentre trial in patients with morbid obesity undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Patients are randomly assigned to either UDCA 900â€‰mg daily for 6 months or placebo treatment. This paper details the statistical analysis plan (SAP) of this trial and was submitted before outcome data were available. The primary endpoint of this trial is symptomatic gallstone disease within 24â€‰months after bariatric surgery, defined as admission or hospital visit for symptomatic gallstone disease. Secondary outcomes consist of the development of gallstones/sludge on ultrasound at 24â€‰months in the gallstone-negative group at baseline, presence of gallstones/sludge on ultrasound at 24â€‰months, number of cholecystectomies, side effects of UDCA, therapy compliance, quality of life, costs and revenues. Analyses will be completed according to this pre-specified SAP. The main analysis will be performed as a standard ITT analysis using the chi-squared test. The UPGRADE trial will show if prophylactic use of UDCA reduces the incidence of symptomatic gallstone disease after bariatric surgery. Unforeseen deviations from the SAP at the time of analysis will be motivated and discussed. The Netherlands Trial Register NL5954 . Registered on 21 November 2016.",10.1186/s13063-020-04605-7,,,,789
138,The Impact of Bariatric Surgery on the Incidence of Colorectal Cancer in Patients with Obesity-a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Registry Data.,"Cancer and obesity represent two of the most significant global health concerns. The risk of malignancy, including colorectal cancer (CRC), increases with obesity. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the value of bariatric surgery in reducing CRC risk in patients with obesity using registry data. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed as per PRISMA guidelines. The risk of CRC was expressed as a dichotomous variable and reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the Mantel-Haenszel method. A multi-treatment comparison was performed, examining the risk reduction associated with existing bariatric surgery techniques. Analysis was performed using RevMan, R packages, and Shiny. Data from 11 registries including 6,214,682 patients with obesity were analyzed. Of these, 14.0% underwent bariatric surgery (872,499/6,214,682), and 86.0% did not undergo surgery (5,432,183/6,214,682). The mean age was 49.8 years, and mean follow-up was 5.1 years. In total, 0.6% of patients who underwent bariatric surgery developed CRC (4,843/872,499), as did 1.0% of unoperated patients with obesity (54,721/5,432,183). Patients with obesity who underwent bariatric surgery were less likely to develop CRC (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.36-0.77, P < 0.001, I2 = 99%). Patients with obesity undergoing gastric bypass surgery (GB) (OR: 0.513, 95% CI: 0.336-0.818) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) (OR: 0.484, 95% CI: 0.307-0.763) were less likely to develop CRC than unoperated patients. At a population level, bariatric surgery is associated with reduced CRC risk in patients with obesity. GB and SG are associated with the most significant reduction in CRC risk.

1137,The influence of the percentage of the common limb in weight loss and nutritional alterations after laparoscopic gastric bypass.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is considered the gold standard for the treatment of morbid obesity. There is no consensus over ideal limb length when the bypass is created and published studies do not take into account the influence of the common limb (CL) on weight loss. The objective was to study the influence of the common limb after RYGB. The setting was the Virgen de la Arrixaca University Clinical Hospital in Murcia, Spain. This prospective study includes 151 patients undergoing laparoscopic RYGB surgery for morbid obesity. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to their body mass index. The small intestine (SI) was measured using micro forceps so that the percentage of common limb (%CL) could then be compared against the total SI in each patient. The percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) in relation to the %CL was calculated at 3, 12, and 24 months. A series of tests was conducted simultaneously to analyze nutritional deficiencies and their relation to the %CL. The total jejunoileal segment and the %CL in the groups of both obese and super-obese patients had no influence on the %EWL in either group for any of the periods studied. The patients with a %CL<50% had greater nutritional deficiencies in the follow-up period and required supplements and more frequent laboratory tests. The %CL has no effect on weight loss in RYGB patients. A lower %CL is related to greater nutritional deficiencies.",10.1016/j.soard.2014.06.009,,,,791
401,Foregut Exclusion Enhances Incretin and Insulin Secretion After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes.,"Patients with type 2 diabetes experience resolution of hyperglycemia within days after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. This is attributed, in part, to enhanced secretion of hindgut factors following exclusion of the gastric remnant and proximal intestine during surgery. However, evidence of the mechanisms of remission remain limited due to the challenges of metabolic evaluation during the early postoperative period. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the role of foregut exclusion in the resolution of type 2 diabetes after RYGB. Patients with type 2 diabetes (nâ€…=â€…15) undergoing RYGB had a gastrostomy tube (G-tube) placed in their gastric remnant at time of surgery. Patients were randomized to receive a mixed meal tolerance test via oral or G-tube feeding immediately prior to and 2 weeks after surgery in a repeated measures crossover design. Plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, incretin responses, and indices of meal-stimulated insulin secretion and sensitivity were determined. Body weight, fat mass, fasting glucose and insulin, and circulating lipids were significantly decreased 2 weeks after surgery. The glycemic response to feeding was reduced as a function of total area under the curve but not after adjustment for the reduction in fasting glucose. Oral feeding significantly enhanced insulin and incretin secretion after RYGB, which was entirely ablated by G-tube feeding. Foregut exclusion accounts for the rise in incretin and insulin secretion but may not fully explain the early improvements in glucose metabolism after RYGB surgery.",10.1210/clinem/dgab255,,,,792
1599,Is weight reduction an effective therapy for nonalcoholic fatty liver? A systematic review.,"To assess the evidence supporting the efficacy of weight reduction for patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver. Potentially relevant studies were identified by a computerized search of databases and a manual search of abstracts from scientific meetings. Studies were included if they reported histology, serum aminotransferase levels, or radiological imaging of the liver in obese adult patients who had undergone weight reduction. Weight reduction regimens included diet, exercise, antiobesity medications, gastric bypass, gastroplasty, or any combination of these interventions. Studies involving jejunoileal or small bowel bypass surgery were excluded. We identified 517 potentially relevant studies, of which 15 met the inclusion criteria: one randomized controlled trial (in abstract form), two nonrandomized controlled trials, nine case series, one retrospective review, and two case reports. Three studies included more than 50 patients, whereas nine studies had 25 or fewer patients. Twelve studies used behavioral, dietary, or pharmacologic therapy for weight reduction, and three studies used surgical interventions. Although all 15 studies demonstrated overall improvement in the measurements of liver outcome after weight reduction, more than half did not report histologic results. Despite general acceptance that weight reduction is an effective therapy for nonalcoholic fatty liver, this systematic review found little data to support or refute this recommendation.",10.1016/s0002-9343(03)00449-2,,,,793
960,"Energy Metabolic Adaptation and Cardiometabolic Improvements One Year After Gastric Bypass, Sleeve Gastrectomy, and Gastric Band.","It is not known whether the magnitude of metabolic adaptation, a greater than expected drop in energy expenditure, depends on the type of bariatric surgery and is associated with cardiometabolic improvements. To compare changes in energy expenditure (metabolic chamber) and circulating cardiometabolic markers 8 weeks and 1 year after Roux-en-y bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB), or a low-calorie diet (LCD). Design, Setting, Participants, and Intervention: This was a parallel-arm, prospective observational study of 30 individuals (27 females; mean age, 46 Â± 2 years; body mass index, 47.2 Â± 1.5 kg/m2) either self-selecting bariatric surgery (five RYGB, nine SG, seven LAGB) or on a LCD (n = 9) intervention (800 kcal/d for 8 weeks, followed by weight maintenance). After 1 year, the RYGB and SG groups had similar degrees of body weight loss (33-36%), whereas the LAGB and LCD groups had 16 and 4% weight loss, respectively. After adjusting for changes in body composition, 24-hour energy expenditure was significantly decreased in all treatment groups at 8 weeks (-254 to -82 kcal/d), a drop that only persisted in RYGB (-124 Â± 42 kcal/d; P = .002) and SG (-155 Â± 118 kcal/d; P = .02) groups at 1 year. The degree of metabolic adaptation (24-hour and sleeping energy expenditure) was not significantly different between the treatment groups at either time-point. Plasma high-density lipoprotein and total and high molecular weight adiponectin were increased, and triglycerides and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were reduced 1 year after RYGB or SG. Metabolic adaptation of approximately 150 kcal/d occurs after RYGB and SG surgery. Future studies are required to examine whether these effects remain beyond 1 year.",10.1210/jc.2016-1814,,,,794
492,Improvements of health-related quality of life 5 years after gastric bypass. What is important besides weight loss? A study from Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Register.,"Obesity continues to increase in the world. It is strongly associated with morbidity, mortality, and decrease of health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Surgery is the most effective treatment for obesity, resulting in sustained weight loss and improvements of HRQoL. The aim of this study was to examine whether other factors, apart from weight loss, are associated with improvement in HRQoL scores between the preoperative visit and the 5-year follow-up. To examine whether there are factors besides weight loss that affect the improvement of HRQoL from before to 5 years after gastric bypass surgery. Large, nationwide, observational study with national quality and research registry. Patients operated with a primary gastric bypass in Sweden between January 2008 and December 2012 were identified in the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Register. Patients with HRQoL data available at both baseline and 5 years after surgery were included. Two HRQoL instruments, the RAND Short form-36 and the obesity-related problems scale, were used in the study. The study sample comprised 6998 patients (21% men). Differences in HRQoL change according to sex were minor. Younger patients showed greater improvements in physical health scales. In general linear regression model analyses, age and weight loss correlated significantly with improvement in HRQoL after 5 years. Patients treated medically for depression preoperatively (13%) experienced less improvement in HRQoL than patients without such treatment. Patients with postoperative complications (26%) had significantly less improvements in all aspects of HRQoL compared with those without any form of postoperative complication. The study confirmed the importance of weight loss for improvement in HRQoL after bariatric surgery. Preoperative medication for depression and suffering a complication during the 5-year follow-up period were associated with less improvement in HRQoL.",10.1016/j.soard.2020.04.041,,,,795
689,"Early Changes in Adipose Tissue Morphology, Gene Expression, and Metabolism After RYGB in Patients With Obesity and T2D.","Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery effectively prevents or treats type 2 diabetes (T2D). Adipose tissue (AT) mechanisms may be of importance. To assess the relationship between early changes in whole-body and AT metabolism in surgically treated patients with T2D. A randomized single-center study. Nineteen patients with T2D with body mass index 30 to 45 kg/m2. Thirteen patients were assessed at baseline and 4 and 24 weeks after RYGB (preceded by a 4-week low-calorie diet) and compared with 6 control patients continuing standard medical treatment: oral glucose tolerance test, subcutaneous AT biopsies for gene expression, adipocyte size, glucose uptake, lipolysis, and insulin action. At 4 and 24 weeks post-RYGB, all patients but one had stopped diabetes medication. Fasting glucose, HbA1c, and insulin levels decreased and the Matsuda index increased compared with baseline (P < 0.01 for all), indicating improved whole-body insulin sensitivity. Mean adipocyte size significantly reduced, more at 4 than at 24 weeks; at 4 weeks, glucose uptake per adipocyte was lowered, and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis tended to increase, whereas the fold insulin effects on glucose uptake and lipolysis were unchanged. Expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, CPT1b and adiponectin, was increased at 4 weeks, whereas leptin and E2F1 (involved in cell proliferation) were reduced (P < 0.05 for all). Glycemic control and in vivo insulin sensitivity improved 4 weeks after RYGB, but adipocyte insulin sensitivity did not change despite a marked reduction in adipocyte size. Thus, mechanisms for a rapid improvement of T2D after RYGB may occur mainly in other tissues than adipose.",10.1210/jc.2018-02165,,,,796
1012,"IV Acetaminophen Results in Lower Hospital Costs and Emergency Room Visits Following Bariatric Surgery: a Double-Blind, Prospective, Randomized Trial in a Single Accredited Bariatric Center.","Postoperative pain control in bariatric surgery is challenging, despite use of intravenous (IV) narcotics. IV acetaminophen is one pain control alternative. The aim of this study was to investigate the economic impact of IV acetaminophen in bariatric surgery and its effect on patients' pain, satisfaction, and hospital length of stay. In a randomized controlled trial, Group 1 (treatment) received IV acetaminophen plus IV narcotics 30 min before surgery, then medication plus IV narcotics/PO narcotics for the remaining 18 h. Group 2 (control) received IV normal saline plus IV/PO narcotics. Patients underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Primary outcomes included direct hospital costs, length of stay, postoperative pain, and patient satisfaction. Secondary outcomes included indirect costs, rescue narcotics dosage, and 30-day outcomes. Mean direct hospital cost in the treatment group (nâ€‰=â€‰50) was $3089.18 versus $2991.62 for the control group (nâ€‰=â€‰50) (pâ€‰>â€‰0.05). Pain scores did not differ significantly (pâ€‰=â€‰0.61). After adjusting for surgery type, there was no significant difference in length of stay (pâ€‰=â€‰0.95). Significantly more control group patients incurred surgery-related indirect costs (10 versus 2%, pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), with greater presentation to the emergency department (ED) for abdominal pain (5/50 versus 1/50), yielding higher total indirect costs ($39,293 versus $13,185). Using IV acetaminophen for postoperative pain management produced notable indirect cost savings and reduced ED visits in the first 30 days postoperatively, with good safety and tolerance. Decreased statistical power may have accounted for certain non-significant findings.",10.1007/s11605-016-3088-0,,,,797
1519,Changes in body composition with weight loss: obese subjects randomized to surgical and medical programs.,"To assess changes in body composition with weight loss in obese subjects randomized to a laparoscopic adjustable gastric band surgical program or a medical program using a very-low-energy diet and orlistat. Using body composition measurements by DXA, neutron activation for total body nitrogen, and whole body gamma counting for total body potassium, we studied changes in fat mass, fat distribution, fat-free mass, total bone mineral content, total body protein, and body cell mass at 6 (n = 61 paired) and 24 months (n = 53 paired) after randomization. At 24 months, the surgical group had lost significantly more weight (surgical, 20.3 +/- 6.5 kg; medical, 5.9 +/- 8.0 kg). There was favorable fat-free mass to fat mass loss ratios for both groups (surgical, 1:5.5; medical, 1:5.9). Changes in total body nitrogen or potassium were favorable in each group. A small reduction in mean bone mineral content occurred throughout the study but was not associated with extent of weight loss or treatment group. At 6 months, weight loss for both groups was similar (surgical, 14.1 +/- 4.5 kg; medical, 13.3 +/- 7.3 kg). The medical program subjects lost less fat-free mass and skeletal muscle and had increased total body protein. The proportion of body fat to limb fat remained remarkably constant throughout the study. Weight loss programs used in this study induced fat loss without significant deleterious effects on the components of fat-free mass.",10.1038/oby.2007.639,,,,798
1525,Incidence of gastroenterostomy stenosis in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass using 21- or 25-mm circular stapler: a randomized prospective blinded study.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the most common bariatric procedure performed in the United States today. The most common early complication after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y is stenosis. No randomized studies have compared the effect of the different staplers on the incidence of stenosis or on long-term weight loss. We compared the anastomoses performed with the two sizes of circular stapler in common use. A total of 200 patients were randomized to undergo 21-mm (n = 100) or 25-mm (n = 100) circular stapled gastroenterostomy after induction of anesthesia. No other differences were allowed in the operative technique. Stenosis was defined as patient complaints of dysphagia leading to endoscopy within 10 weeks of surgery, in which a 9-mm diameter endoscope would not pass through the gastroenterostomy without dilation. Of the 200 patients, 19 patients in the 21-mm group and 8 in the 25-mm group underwent endoscopy for symptoms (P = 0.027). Of the 19 and 8 patients, 17 and 7, respectively, had measurable stenosis at endoscopy (p = 0.035). Patients with a 21-mm anastomosis developed symptoms an average of 4.8 +/- 1.2 weeks after surgery, and those with a 25-mm anastomosis developed symptoms an average of 8.9 +/- 3.8 weeks postoperatively (P <0.001). We found a significant difference in the stenosis rate between the 21-mm and 25-mm circular stapled anastomoses in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The 21-mm staplers led to significantly more endoscopies than did the 25-mm staplers. Symptoms leading to endoscopy occurred significantly later with use of a 25-mm stapler than after a 21-mm stapler.",10.1016/j.soard.2006.11.014,,,,799
1266,Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of leptin administration after gastric bypass.,"Obese individuals have high levels of circulating leptin and are resistant to the weight-reducing effect of leptin administration at physiological doses. Although Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is an effective weight loss procedure, there is a plateau in weight loss and most individuals remain obese. This plateau may be partly due to the decline in leptin resulting in a state of relative leptin insufficiency. The main objective of this study was to determine whether leptin administration to post-RYGB patients would promote further weight reduction. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study of 27 women who were at least 18 months post-RYGB and lost on average 30.8% of their presurgical body weight. Subjects received either leptin or placebo via subcutaneous injection twice daily for 16 weeks, then crossed over to receive the alternate treatment for 16 weeks. Weight change after 16 weeks of placebo was not significantly different from that after 16 weeks of leptin. No changes were observed in percent fat mass, resting energy expenditure, thyroid hormones, or cortisol levels. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not observe a significant effect of leptin treatment on body weight in women with relative hypoleptinemia after RYGB.",10.1002/oby.20433,,,,800
1440,Improvement in peripheral glucose uptake after gastric bypass surgery is observed only after substantial weight loss has occurred and correlates with the magnitude of weight lost.,"Altered gut and pancreatic hormone secretion may bolster resolution of insulin resistance after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), but the independent effects of weight loss and hormonal secretion on peripheral glucose disposal are unknown. Two groups of nondiabetic morbidly obese patients were studied: RYGB followed by standardized caloric restriction (RYGB, n = 12) or caloric restriction alone (diet, n = 10). Metabolic evaluations (euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, meal tolerance test) were done at baseline and 14 days (both groups) and 6 months after RYGB. At baseline, body composition, fasting insulin, and glucose and peripheral glucose disposal did not differ between groups. At 14 days, excess weight loss (EWL) was similar (RYGB, 12.7% vs. diet, 10.9%; p = 0.12), fasting insulin and glucose decreased to a similar extent, and RYGB subjects had altered postmeal patterns of gut and pancreatic hormone secretion. However, peripheral glucose uptake (M value) was unchanged in both groups. Six months after RYGB, EWL was 49.7%. The changes in fasting glucose and insulin levels and gut hormone secretion persisted. M values improved significantly, and changes in M values correlated with the % EWL (r = 0.68, p = 0.02). Improvement in peripheral glucose uptake following RYGB was observed only after substantial weight loss had occurred and correlated with the magnitude of weight lost.",10.1007/s11605-009-1060-y,,,,801
1336,Robotic vs. laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in morbidly obese patients: systematic review and pooled analysis.,"The aim of this study was to provide pooled analysis of individually small trials comparing robotic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RRYGB) with standard laparoscopic RYGB (LRYGB). A systematic literature search of Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library databases was performed. Primary outcome measures were the incidence of anastomotic leak and stricture. Secondary outcome measures were post-operative complications, operative time and length of hospital stay. Seven relevant studies of 1686 patients were included in this analysis. There was a significantly reduced incidence of anastomotic stricture in the robotic group (PORâ€‰=â€‰0.43; 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.19 to 0.98; pâ€‰=â€‰0.04). There was no significant difference between robotic and laparoscopic groups for anastomotic leak, post-operative complications, operative time and length of hospital stay. The incidence of anastomotic stricture was reduced with RRYGB compared with LRYGB over a minimum follow-up period of 6â€‰months, thus demonstrating the potential benefit of RRYGB.",10.1002/rcs.414,,,,802
1158,Surgical treatment of type 2 diabetes in subjects with mild obesity: mechanisms underlying metabolic improvements.,"This study aims to assess the clinical and physiological effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) on type 2 diabetes associated with mild obesity (body mass index [BMI] 30-34.9 kg/m(2)) over 24 months postsurgery. In this prospective trial, 36 mildly obese subjects (19 males) with type 2 diabetes using oral antidiabetic drugs with (nâ€‰=â€‰24) or without insulin (nâ€‰=â€‰12) underwent RYGBP. Follow-up was conducted at baseline and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postsurgery. The following endpoints were considered: changes in HbA1c, fasting glucose and insulin, antidiabetic therapy, BMI, oral glucose insulin sensitivity [OGIS, from meal tolerance test (MTT)], beta-cell secretory function [Î”CP(0-30)/Î”Glu(0-30) (Î”C-peptide/Î”glucose ratio, MTT 0-30 min), disposition index (DIâ€‰=â€‰OGISâ€‰[Symbol: see text]â€‰Î”CP(0-30)/Î”Glu(0-30)], glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) [incremental area under the curve (AUCi)], adiponectin, C-reactive protein, and lipids. All subjects achieved normal-to-overweight BMI after 3 months. Over 24 months, 31/36 (86 %) subjects presented HbA1c <7 % [complete and partial remission of diabetes in 9/36 (22 %) and 1/36 (3 %), respectively]. Since 3 months postsurgery, improvements were observed in OGIS [290 (174) to 373 (77) ml/min/m(2), Pâ€‰=â€‰0.009], Î”CP(0-30)/Î”Glu(0-30) [0.24 (0.19) to 0.52 (0.34) ng/mg, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001], DI [7.16 (8.53) to 19.8 (15.4) (ng/mg) (ml/min/m(2)), Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001], GLP-1 AUCi [0.56 (0.64) to 3.97 (3.86) ng/dlâ€‰[Symbol: see text]â€‰10 minâ€‰[Symbol: see text]â€‰103, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.000], and GIP AUCi [30.2 (12.6) to 27.0 (20.2) ng/dlâ€‰[Symbol: see text]â€‰10 minâ€‰[Symbol: see text]â€‰103, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.004]. At baseline and after 12 months, subjects with diabetes nonremission had longer diabetes duration, higher HbA1c, lower beta-cell secretory function, and higher first 30-min GIP AUCi, compared with those with remission. RYGBP improves the glucose metabolism in subjects with type 2 diabetes and mild obesity. This effect is associated with improvement of insulin sensitivity, beta-cell secretory function, and incretin secretion.",10.1007/s11695-014-1377-9,,,,803
1003,Bone resorption following weight loss surgery is associated with treatment procedure and changes in secreted Wnt antagonists.,"To assess if altered bone turnover following bariatric surgery is related to metabolic consequences of the surgical procedure or weight loss. We evaluated serum markers reflecting bone turnover and metabolic pathways at baseline and after 1-year in a controlled non-randomized clinical trial comparing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (nÂ =Â 74) with lifestyle intervention (nÂ =Â 63) on obesity-related comorbidities. The decrease in body mass index (BMI) was larger in the surgery (-14.0Â kg/m(2)) compared to lifestyle (-3.7Â kg/m(2)). Markedly increased bone turnover was observed following surgery compared to lifestyle intervention and was correlated with change in BMI. Stepwise multivariable regression analysis revealed that group (Î²Â =Â 0.31, pÂ <Â 0.01), and changes in BMI (Î²Â =Â -0.28, pÂ <Â 0.01), dickkopf-1 (Î²Â =Â 0.20, pÂ <Â 0.001) and sclerostin (Î²Â =Â 0.11, pÂ <Â 0.05) were predictors of change in the bone resorption marker N-terminal telopeptide. Our data support that mechanisms related to the procedure itself and changes in secreted Wnt antagonists may contribute to increased bone turnover following bariatric surgery.",10.1007/s12020-016-0903-z,,,,804
1318,A pilot study investigating the efficacy of postoperative dietary counseling to improve outcomes after bariatric surgery.,"Bariatric surgery is a powerful treatment of severe obesity. During the past several years, a greater appreciation for the need for multidisciplinary care to optimize outcomes has developed, and a number of studies have been started to examine the role of postoperative interventions used in combination with surgery. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that the provision of postoperative dietary counseling, delivered by a registered dietitian, would lead to greater weight loss and more positive improvements in dietary intake and eating behavior compared with standard postoperative care. The study was performed at an academic medical center. Eighty-four individuals who underwent bariatric surgery were randomly assigned to receive either dietary counseling or standard postoperative care for the first 4 months after surgery. The participants completed measures of macronutrient intake and eating behavior at baseline and 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after surgery. The patients who received dietary counseling achieved greater weight loss than those who received standard postoperative care that did not involve this counseling, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Patients in the dietary counseling arm did report significant changes in several eating behaviors believed to be important to successful long-term weight maintenance. The results of our pilot study provide some support for the efficacy of early postoperative dietary counseling to improve outcomes after bariatric surgery.",10.1016/j.soard.2012.02.010,,,,805
220,Systematic review on sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery for refractory gastroparesis.,"Management of refractory gastroparesis is challenging after diet, prokinetics, and long-term nutritional support have failed. In this review, the efficacy and safety of surgical interventions (sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery) are evaluated systematically in patients with refractory gastroparesis. The PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases were searched to identify relevant studies published up to June 2021. Outcome of interest was symptom improvement and gastric emptying. Nineteen studies with 222 refractory gastroparesis patients (147 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 39 sleeve gastrectomy, and 36 subtotal gastrectomy) were included. All studies reported symptom improvement postoperatively, particularly vomiting and nausea. Gastric emptying improved postoperatively in 45% up to 67% for sleeve gastrectomy and 87% for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The findings of our systematic review suggest that sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery improve symptoms and gastric emptying in patients with refractory gastroparesis. Surgery may be effective as treatment for a small group of patients when all other therapies have failed.",10.1016/j.soard.2022.09.009,,,,806
1366,The impact of complications on costs of major surgical procedures: a cost analysis of 1200 patients.,"To assess the impact of postoperative complications on full in-hospital costs per case. Rising expenses for complex medical procedures combined with constrained resources represent a major challenge. The severity of postoperative complications reflects surgical outcomes. The magnitude of the cost created by negative outcomes is unclear. Morbidity of 1200 consecutive patients undergoing major surgery from 2005 to 2008 in a tertiary, high-volume center was assessed by a validated, complication score system. Full in-hospital costs were collected for each patient. Statistical analysis was performed using a multivariate linear regression model adjusted for potential confounders. This study population included 393 complex liver/bile duct surgeries, 110 major pancreas operations, 389 colon resections, and 308 Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 1.8%, whereas morbidity was 53.8%. Patients with an uneventful course had mean costs per case of US$ 27,946 (SD US$ 15,106). Costs increased dramatically with the severity of postoperative complications and reached the mean costs of US$ 159,345 (SD US$ 151,191) for grade IV complications. This increase in costs, up to 5 times the cost of a similar operation without complications, was observed for all types of investigated procedures, although the magnitude of the increase varied, with the highest costs in patients undergoing pancreas surgery. This study demonstrates the dramatic impact of postoperative complications on full in-hospital costs per case and that complications are the strongest indicator of costs. Furthermore, the study highlights a relevant savings capacity for major surgical procedures, and supports all efforts to lower negative events in the postoperative course.",10.1097/SLA.0b013e31821d4a43,,,,807
1315,Prevalence of adverse intraoperative events during obesity surgery and their sequelae.,"Adverse intraoperative events (AIEs) during surgery are a well-known entity. A better understanding of the incidence of AIEs and their relationship with outcomes is helpful for surgeon preparation and preoperative patient counseling. The goals of this study are to describe the incidence of AIEs during bariatric surgery and examine their impact on major adverse complications. The study included 5,882 subjects who had bariatric surgery in the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery study between March 2005 and April 2009. Prospectively collected AIEs included organ injuries, anesthesia-related events, anastomotic revisions, and equipment failure. The relationship between AIEs and a composite end point of 30-day major adverse complications (ie, death, venous thromboembolism, percutaneous, endoscopic, or operative reintervention and failure to be discharged from the hospital within 30 days from surgery) was evaluated using a multivariable relative risk model adjusting for factors known to influence their risk. There were 1,608 laparoscopic adjusted gastric banding, 3,770 laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass operations, and 504 open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass operations. Adverse intraoperative events occurred in 5% of the overall sample and were most frequent during open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (7.3%), followed by laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (5.5%) and laparoscopic adjusted gastric banding (3%). The rate of composite end point was 8.8% in the AIE group compared with 3.9% among those without an AIE (p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis revealed that patients with an AIE were at 90% greater risk of composite complication than those without an event (relative risk = 1.90; 95% CI, 1.26-2.88; p = 0.002), independent of the type of procedure (open or laparoscopic). Incidence of an AIE is not infrequent during bariatric surgery and is associated with much higher risk of major complication. Additional study is needed to assess the association between specific AIEs and short-term complications.",10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2012.03.008,,,,808
1416,Roux-en-Y bypass gastroplasty: markers of oxidative stress 6 months after surgery.,"This study examined the effect of weight loss on energy intake, vitamin C, E, beta-carotene (diet/blood), reduced glutathione (GSH), C-reactive protein (CRP), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), catalase, and myeloperoxidase, in patients with Roux-en-Y bypass gastroplasty. Prospective clinical study with control (C) and bariatric (B) groups (n = 20 each). Age was 38.8 +/- 11.1 (C) and 37.8 +/- 11.2 years (B), and body mass indices (BMI) were 22.4 +/- 2.4 and 48.1 +/- 8.7 kg/m(2), respectively. Group C was assessed on a single occasion and B at three time points (basal period and 3 and 6 months after gastroplasty). BMI was decreased at three (38.3 +/- 1.7, P = 0.018) and 6 months after surgery (34.9 +/- 1.7, P < 0.001). Mean weight loss was 20.53 +/- 1.1 after three and 27.96 +/- 1.3 kg after 6 months. Serum vitamin C and beta-carotene (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively) were increased at 6 months compared to basal. Basal serum vitamin C (P = 0.001) and beta-carotene (P < 0.001) were lower compared to controls. Serum vitamin E corrected for cholesterol and triglycerides was higher in group B at three (P = 0.01) and 6 months (P = 0.001) and lower at basal (P < 0.001) compared to controls. GSH was higher in controls (P < 0.001) compared to basal. Catalase (P = 0.01) and TBARS (P < 0.001) were higher in group B at 6 months. TBARS were higher (P < 0.001) at basal compared to controls. Myeloperoxidase and CRP decreased in group B after three (P = 0.028, P = 0.010) and 6 months (P < 0.001, P = 0.001), respectively. Roux-en-Y bypass gastroplasty led to decreased proinflammatory parameters together with increased nutritional antioxidants, catalase, and TBARS, and decreased GSH 6 months after surgery.",10.1007/s11695-010-0196-x,,,,809
371,A systematic review and meta-analyses of food preference modifications after bariatric surgery.,"This systematic review and meta-analyses aimed to synthesize evidence of the link between bariatric surgery and changes in food preferences, considering the method of assessment. MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Cinahl, PsychINFO, ProQuest, and Open grey were searched incorporating two blocks of terms (""Intervention"" and ""Food Preferences""). Interventional or observational studies involving patients (BMIâ€‰â‰¥â€‰35â€‰kgâ€‰m-2 ) with sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) and a control group were included. Meta-analyses were performed comparing the standardized daily mean percentage energy from proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids between preoperative and postoperative patients. Fifty-seven studies concerning 2,271 patients with RYGB and 903 patients with SG met the inclusion criteria, of which 24 were eligible for meta-analysis. Despite a total reduction in macronutrient intakes, the meta-analyses revealed a postoperative increase in percentage energy from proteins at 12â€‰months (0.24, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.46, {I2 }â€‰=â€‰73%) and a decrease in percentage energy from fat at 1Â month (-0.47, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.09, {I2 }â€‰=â€‰72%), up to 24â€‰months (-0.20, 95% CI: -0.31, 0.08, {I2 }â€‰=â€‰0%). In conclusion, the present systematic review and meta-analyses showed changes of food preferences in terms of macronutrient, food selection and, overall food appreciation up to 5Â years following bariatric surgery.",10.1111/obr.13315,,,,810
50,Poor diet quality is associated with biochemical parameters of protein nutritional status after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"To assess diet quality and its association with body and biochemical parameters in patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Prospective observational study with individuals of both sexes subjected to RYGB. Body composition, biochemical parameters, and diet quality were assessed before and six months after RYGB. Diet quality was assessed by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI). Data were analyzed by the paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test, with a significance level of 5%. Spearman's correlation and simple linear regression were performed between variables. The final sample included 34 patients. Their diet was classified as poor before and 6 mo after RYGB. BMI, fat mass, fat-free mass, waist perimeter, serum total protein, transthyretin, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, and C-reactive protein decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Variations in the HEI score and caloric intake were associated with serum albumin and transthyretin (P < 0.05). Poor diet quality was present before and six months after RYGB, and the study data suggest that poor diet quality is associated to a risk of loss of lean body mass and visceral protein six months after RYGB.",10.1016/j.nut.2024.112419,,,,811
1648,[Esophagogastric bypass anastomosis for benign stricture of cardia].,"The aim of the study is to discuss our observations concerning oesophagogastric bypass anastomosis in cases with scar stricture of cardia in long-term achalasia (megaoesophagus). The Heller operation is ineffective in such patients and the resection of cardia with oesophagogastric anastomosis is a large and controversial operation. 16 patients were operated (6 of them after ineffective cardiomyotomy). In all cases long-term dysphagia, big loss of weight and large, S-shaped oesophagus lying on the diaphragm were found. The left side thoracotomy was performed and fundus of the stomach was dislocated to the chest through dilatatored oesophageal hiatus and with the oesophagus above the cardia. There were no postoperative complications. However, dysphagia regressed. The remote results (from 1 year to 7 years) in 11 patients were analysed. The general condition was satisfactory. No dysphagia and gastrooesophageal reflux was revealed. Anastomosis was efficient in X-ray examination.

There is a lack of studies on the evolution of bone health of elderly people who underwent bariatric surgery, in general, and when comparing the gastric bypass (GB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) techniques. To evaluate the bone health of elderly patients with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery. This is a prospective randomized clinical study, that was carried out with individuals of both sexes, â‰¥65 years, undergoing GB or SG and who met the inclusion criteria. Age, gender and comorbidities (type 2 diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia and osteoarthrosis) were collected and analyzed at baseline. Anthropometric data (weight, body mass index, percentage of weight loss, percentage of excess weight loss), laboratory tests related to bone health and bone mineral density were analyzed before and 24 months after surgery. A total of 36 patients (GB, n=18; SG, n=18) were evaluated. At baseline, except for sex and preoperative body mass index, which was higher in GB, groups were similar. After 24 months, GB was superior for weight loss (%WL) and excess weight loss (%EWL). Regarding bone health, a significant decrease of BMD was observed in the spine, total proximal femur and femoral neck in all groups, with an average decrease of 5.1%, 10.5% and 15.1%, respectively. In addition, the observed decrease in BMD was up to 25% in the total femur after 24 months, six patients went from normal BMD to osteopenia and one from osteopenia to osteoporosis. There was no difference in parathormone values. However, there was an association between the increase in parathormone and the decrease in BMD in the spine, mainly in the GB group. There was no association between %WL and %EWL with the reduction in BMD. Bariatric surgery was related to the reduction of BMD in elderly patients, but there was no statistical difference between the two surgical techniques.",10.1590/S0004-2803.202204000-91,,,,813
246,Racial Differences in Bariatric Surgical Approach: a Cross-Sectional National Inpatient Sample Analysis.,"Although racial inequalities in referral and access to bariatric surgical care have been well reported, racial difference in the selection of surgical techniques is understudied. This study examined factors associated with the utilization of the two main bariatric surgical techniques: laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). The National Inpatient Sample database was queried for patients who underwent elective LSG or LRYGB for the treatment of severe obesity. Chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression assessed associations of surgical approach with patient and facility characteristics. Sensitivity analyses examined the following body mass index (BMI) subgroups:â€‰<â€‰40.0Â kg/m2, 40.0-44.9Â kg/m2, 45.0-49.9Â kg/m2, andâ€‰â‰¥â€‰50.0Â kg/m2. Within the final cohort (Nâ€‰=â€‰86,053), 73.0% (Nâ€‰=â€‰62,779) underwent LSG, and 27.0% (Nâ€‰=â€‰23,274) underwent LRYGB. Patients with BMI 45.0-49.9Â kg/m2 (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.85) and BMIâ€‰â‰¥â€‰50.0Â kg/m2 (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.80) were less likely to undergo LSG than patients with BMI 40.0-45.0Â kg/m2 (all pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). However, Black (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.74) and White Hispanic patients (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.30) were more likely to undergo LSG than White non-Hispanic patients (all pâ€‰<â€‰0.005). In the BMIâ€‰â‰¥â€‰50.0Â kg/m2 group, Black patients were still more likely to undergo LSG compared to White non-Hispanic patients (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.69, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), while Asians/Pacific Islanders were less likely to receive LSG than White non-Hispanic patients (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.41, pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). In this observational study, we identified racial differences in the selection of common bariatric surgical approaches across various BMI categories. Future investigations are warranted to study and to promote awareness of the racial/ethnic influence in attitudes on obesity, weight loss, financial support, and surgical risks during bariatric discussions with minorities.",10.1007/s11695-022-06227-1,,,,814
160,"Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Crossover Trial of Once Daily Empagliflozin 25â€‰mg for the Treatment of Postprandial Hypoglycemia After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.","Aims: To investigate the effect of empagliflozin on glucose dynamics in individuals suffering from postbariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Methods: Twenty-two adults with PBH after RYGB were randomized to empagliflozin 25â€‰mg or placebo once daily over 20 days in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. The primary efficacy outcome was the amplitude of plasma glucose excursion (peak to nadir) during a mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT). Outcomes of the outpatient period were assessed using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and an event-tracking app. Results: The amplitude of glucose excursion during the MMTT was 8.1â€‰Â±â€‰2.4â€‰mmol/L with empagliflozin versus 8.1â€‰Â±â€‰2.6â€‰mmol/L with placebo (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰standard deviation, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.807). CGM-based mean amplitude of glucose excursion during the 20-day period was lower with empagliflozin than placebo (4.8â€‰Â±â€‰1.3 vs. 5.2â€‰Â±â€‰1.6. Pâ€‰=â€‰0.028). Empagliflozin reduced the time spent with CGM values >10.0â€‰mmol/L (3.8â€‰Â±â€‰3.5% vs. 4.7â€‰Â±â€‰3.8%, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.009), but not the time spent with CGM values <3.0â€‰mmol/L (1.7â€‰Â±â€‰1.6% vs. 1.5â€‰Â±â€‰1.5%, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.457). No significant difference was observed in the quantity and quality of recorded symptoms. Eleven adverse events occurred with empagliflozin (three drug-related) and six with placebo. Conclusions: Empagliflozin 25â€‰mg reduces glucose excursions but not hypoglycemia in individuals with PBH. Clinical Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT05057819.",10.1089/dia.2023.0036,,,,815
430,Ketamine infusion reduces narcotic requirements following gastric bypass surgery: a randomized controlled trial.,"As the obesity epidemic worsens, anesthesiologists should expect to see more obese patients presenting for surgical procedures. Opioids cause respiratory depression, which has caused complications in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Opioids can also cause nausea, prolonging the time that patients spend in the postanesthesia care unit. Ketamine is a potential analgesic alternative that may have advantages to narcotics in the bariatric population. To determine whether an intraoperative ketamine infusion would reduce postoperative narcotic use in patients during the first 48 hours after laparoscopic gastric bypass. Major academic medical center. There were 54 participating patients. The intervention group (n = 27) was randomized to receive 100 Î¼g of fentanyl with anesthesia induction, then a 20-mg bolus of ketamine, followed by a 5 Î¼g/kg/min intraoperative ketamine infusion starting after anesthesia induction and ending after wound closure commenced. The control group (narcotic only, n = 27) also received 100 Î¼g of fentanyl at anesthesia induction and intraoperative boluses of fentanyl at the discretion of the anesthesia team, with .3 mg of hydromorphone administered approximately 45 minutes before the completion of surgery. At 24 hours, the mean morphine-equivalent units (MEUs) were 12.7 (standard deviation [SD], 9.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.8-16.6) for the ketamine group (n = 28) and 16.5 (SD, 9.8; 95% CI, 12.6-20.4) for the control group (n = 28). At 48 hours, the MEUs were 16.7 (SD, 12.0; 95% CI, 11.9-21.4) for the ketamine group and 22.7 (SD, 14.9; 95% CI, 16.8-28.6) for the control group. Cumulative MEUs for 24 hours (P = .039) and 48 hours (P = .058) postoperatively were lower in the ketamine group compared with the narcotic-only (control) group, although the difference at 48 hours did not reach statistical significance. Compared with the narcotic-only group, the ketamine group used 26% fewer MEUs after 24 hours and 31% fewer MEUs after 48 hours. This difference can mostly be attributed to group differences during the first 6 hours after surgery. Ketamine successfully reduced the amount of opioids required to control bariatric patients' pain at 24 hours postoperatively, but not over the 48-hour postoperative period.",10.1016/j.soard.2020.11.027,,,,816
607,Effects of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass on Osteoclast Activity and Bone Density in Morbidly Obese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is a well-established treatment for morbid obesity and type 2 diabetes. The effects of RYGB on bone metabolism and bone health are largely unknown. Determine the changes in osteoclast function and bone density 1Â year after RYGB as compared with a control group undergoing a diabetes support and education program (DSE). A prospective cohort study with patients matched for weight and age assigned to RYGB or DSE. Large academic institution. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity (body mass index greater than 35Â kg/m2). Subjects either received laparoscopic RYBG or DSE, which consisted of nutritional, exercise, and dietary counseling performed by a certified diabetic educator and a nutritionist three times over a year. Osteoclast activity, bone mineral density. One year after, intervention subjects undergoing RYGB have a 280% increase in osteoclast activity as compared with a 7.6% increase in the DSE control group (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Furthermore, there was a statistically significant increase in sclerostin levels in subjects undergoing RYGB compared with an increase in the control group. The total bone mineral density was statistically unchanged within 1Â year of intervention in both groups. A statistically significant decrease in bone mineral density in the left ribs (decrease of 6.8%, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) and lumbar spine (decrease of 4.0%, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) was seen 1Â year after RYGB.

226,Frequency of cholelithiasis in need of surgical or endoscopic treatment a decade or more after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Symptomatic cholelithiasis requiring treatment is a known side effect after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), but reported rates vary greatly. The objectives for this study were to evaluate the long-term frequency of surgical or endoscopic treatment for symptomatic cholelithiasis 10-15Â years after RYGBÂ and its relation to self-reported abdominal pain. Observational data from 546 patients who underwent RYGB at public hospitals in Central Norway between March 2003 and December 2009 were analyzed. Median follow-up was 11.5 (range 9.1-16.8) years. Sixty-five (11.9%) patients had undergone cholecystectomy prior to RYGB. Out of the 481 patients with intact gallbladder, 77 (16.0%) patients underwent cholecystectomy and six (1.2%) patients had treatment for choledocholithiasis during the observation period. Median time from RYGB to cholecystectomy or treatment of choledocholithiasis was 51 (range 1-160) and 109 (range 10-151) months, respectively. Female sex was associated with an increased risk of subsequent cholecystectomy [OR (95% CI) 2.88 (1.31-7.15)], pâ€‰<â€‰0.05. There was a higher frequency of self-reported abdominal pain at follow-up [OR (95% CI) 1.92 (1.25-2.93)] among patients who underwent cholecystectomy before or after RYGB. With a median follow-up of more than 11Â years after RYGB, one in six patients with an intact gallbladder at time of RYGB underwent cholecystectomy, and 1.1% of the patients needed surgical or endoscopic treatment for choledocholithiasis. Patients with a history of cholecystectomy reported a higher frequency of abdominal pain.",10.1007/s00464-022-09676-y,,,,818
1216,Changes in sexual functioning and sex hormone levels in women following bariatric surgery.,"Obesity has been associated with impairments in sexual function and untoward changes in reproductive hormones in women. Relatively few studies have investigated changes in these domains following bariatric surgery. To investigate changes in sexual functioning, sex hormone levels, and relevant psychosocial constructs in women who underwent bariatric surgery. A prospective cohort study of 106 women from phase 2 of the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery who underwent bariatric surgery (median [interquartile range] body mass index, 44.5 [41.4-49.7]). Assessments were completed between 2006 and 2012. Bariatric surgery was performed by a surgeon certified by the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (85 women underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and 21 women underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding). Sexual functioning was assessed by use of the Female Sexual Function Index. Hormones were assessed by use of a blood assay. Quality of life, body image, depressive symptoms, and marital adjustment were assessed by use of validated questionnaires. Women lost a mean 32.7% (95% CI, 30.7%-34.7%) of initial body weight at postoperative year 1 and a mean 33.5% (95% CI, 31.5%-35.6%) at postoperative year 2. Two years following surgery, women reported significant improvements in overall sexual functioning and specific domains of sexual functioning: arousal, lubrication, desires, and satisfaction. They also experienced significant changes at 2 years in all hormones of interest. Women reported significant improvements in most domains of quality of life, as well as body image and depressive symptoms, within the first year after surgery, with these improvements being maintained through the second postoperative year. Women who underwent bariatric surgery had significant improvements in overall sexual functioning, in most reproductive hormones of interest, and in psychosocial status. Improvements in sexual health can be added to the list of health benefits associated with bariatric surgery. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00670098.",10.1001/jamasurg.2013.5022,,,,819
954,Calorie restriction and not glucagon-like peptide-1 explains the acute improvement in glucose control after gastric bypass in Type 2 diabetes.,"To compare directly the impact of glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion on glucose metabolism in individuals with Type 2 diabetes listed for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, randomized to be studied before and 7 days after undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or after following a very-low-calorie diet. A semi-solid meal test was used to investigate glucose, insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 response. Insulin secretion in response to intravenous glucose and arginine stimulus was measured. Hepatic and pancreatic fat content was quantified using magnetic resonance imaging. The decrease in fat mass was almost identical in the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and the very-low-calorie diet groups (3.0Â±0.3 and 3.0Â±0.7kg). The early rise in plasma glucose level and in acute insulin secretion were greater after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass than after a very-low-calorie diet; however, the early rise in glucagon-like peptide-1 was disproportionately greater (sevenfold) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass than after a very-low-calorie diet. This did not translate into a greater improvement in fasting glucose level or area under the curve for glucose. The reduction in liver fat was greater after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (29.8Â±3.7 vs 18.6Â±4.0%) and the relationships between weight loss and reduction in liver fat differed between the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass group and the very-low-calorie diet group. This study shows that gastroenterostomy increases the rate of nutrient absorption, bringing about a commensurately rapid rise in insulin level; however, there was no association with the large post-meal rise in glucagon-like peptide-1, and post-meal glucose homeostasis was similar in the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and very-low-calorie diet groups.

1140,"Thermogenic changes after gastric bypass, adjustable gastric banding or dietÂ alone.","The mechanisms by which bariatric surgery achieves weight loss (WL) are under scrutiny. We assessed changes in resting energy expenditure (REE) after gastric bypass (RYGB) and gastric banding (AGB) to determine if changes in REE are associated with WL and type of surgery. Three groups of morbidly obese patients were studied: RYGB (nÂ =Â 12), AGB (nÂ =Â 8), and a control group that underwent caloric restriction alone (Diet, nÂ =Â 10). Studies were performed at baseline and after 14Â days in all groups and 6Â months after RYGB and AGB. REE (kcal/day) was measured by indirect calorimetry and adjusted for body weight (Wt-REE), and lean body mass by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (LBM-REE). At baseline, REE did not differ significantly among groups (RYGBÂ =Â 2,114Â Â±Â 337, AGBÂ =Â 1,837Â Â±Â 154, DietÂ =Â 2,091Â Â±Â 363Â kcal/day, PÂ =Â .13). After 14Â days, the groups had similar percent excess WL (%EWL). Neither Wt-REE nor LBM-REE changed significantly in any group. After 6Â months %EWL was 49Â Â±Â 10% after RYGB and 21Â Â±Â 11% after AGB (PÂ <Â .01); RYGB patients had greater increase in the percent of weight that was LBM (RYGBÂ =Â 7.9Â Â±Â 3.0 vs. AGBÂ =Â 1.6Â Â±Â 1.5%, PÂ <Â .01). Wt-REE increased significantly only after RYGB (+2.58Â Â±Â 1.51Â kcal/kg/day, PÂ <Â .01). There was a significant correlation between changes in Wt-REE and %EWL (rÂ =Â 0.670, PÂ =Â .003). The increase in Wt-REE may be a factor supporting WL after RYGB.",10.1016/j.surg.2014.06.070,,,,821
758,NON-INVASIVE PREVENTIVE VENTILATION WITH TWO PRESSURE LEVELS IN THE POSTOPERATIVE PERIOD OF ROUX-EN-Y GASTRIC BYPASS: RANDOMIZED TRIAL.,"Obesity is characterized by excessive accumulation of body fat, which causes damage to the health of individuals, such as breathing difficulties. To verify the results of non-invasive ventilation as a preventive strategy on the decline of respiratory function and postoperative complications in patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This is a randomized trial, according to CONSORT standards, with obese adults aged 18-40 years. Randomized control group (n=25) only received guidelines regarding posture, early ambulation and cough stimuli, and in the NIV group (n=25), in addition to the aforementioned group, non-invasive ventilation was performed with two pressure levels, once day for 60 min, from the 1st to the 3rd postoperative day (POD). Both groups were evaluated in the preoperative period and in the 1st and 3rd POD for respiratory function, which were: slow vital capacity (VC), inspiratory capacity (IC), minute volume (MV), tidal volume maximal inspiratory muscle strength (Pimax) and peak expiratory flow (PEF). The length of hospital stay and the episodes of postoperative complications were recorded. Of the 50 patients the majority were young adults with degrees of obesity between III and IV. In the intergroup analysis, there was an improvement in the CVL and MV only in the 1st POD in the NIV group, CI in the three moments evaluated in the NIV group and the PFE in the 1st and 3rd PDO also in this group. The most frequent complications were pneumonia, followed by operative wound infection and atelectasis. There was a significant difference between groups, showing a higher occurrence in pneumonia and atelectasis in the control group. The days of hospitalization and intensive care unit were similar. It was observed a faster recovery until the 3rd POD in the IC and PEF variables in the NIV group; in addition, there were fewer complications in this group.",10.1590/0102-672020180001e1361,,,,822
194,Exercise for counteracting weight recurrence after bariatric surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Exercise is recommended to prevent post-surgical weight recurrence. Yet, whether exercise interventions are efficacious in this regard has not been systematically evaluated. Moreover, clinicians lack evidence-based information to advise patients on appropriate exercise frequency, intensity, time, and type (FITT) for preventing weight recurrence. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving exercise interventions specifying FITT and weight measurement â‰¥12 months post-surgery. We reviewed scientific databases up through February 2022 for RCTs comparing exercise interventions reporting FITT and a nonexercise control group on weight â‰¥12 months post-surgery. Procedures following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses were registered at the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42022342337). Of 1368 studies reviewed, 5 met inclusion criteria (n = 189; 47.8 Â± 4.2 yr, 36.1 6 Â± 3.8 kgÂ·m2, 83.2 Â± 9.5% female; 61.7% underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass). Exercise interventions were largely supervised, lasted 12-26 weeks, and prescribed 80-210 minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous intensity combined aerobic and resistance exercise over â‰¤5 days. Within-group effects showed non-statistically significant weight loss for exercise (dÂ = - .15, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.96, 1.65; -1.4 kg; P = .87) and weight gain for control (d = .11, 95% CI: -1.70,1.92; +1.0 kg; P = .90), with no difference between these groupsÂ (dÂ =Â -2.26, 95% CI: -2.07, 1.55; -2.4 kg; P = .78). Exercise elicited an additional 2.4 kg weight loss versus control, although this effect was small and statistically non-significant. AbilityÂ to draw definitive conclusions regarding efficacy of exercise interventions for counteracting post-surgical weight recurrence was limited by the small number of trials and methodological issues. Findings highlight the need for more rigorous RCTs of exercise interventions specifically designed to reduce post-surgical weight recurrence.",10.1016/j.soard.2022.12.029,,,,823
857,"Perioperative complications following bariatric surgery according to the clavien-dindo classification. Score validation, literature review and results in a single-centre series.","There is no unified system for reporting surgical complications after bariatric surgery. One increasingly used system for notifying postoperative complications is the Clavien-Dindo classification, which focuses on their therapeutic implications. The aim of this study is to validate and apply the Clavien-Dindo scale to a series of cases of bariatric surgery and systematically review its use worldwide. University hospital. A cohort of 321 patients with morbid obesity (Mean BMI: 45.4Â±5.5 kg/m2) underwent surgery by the same team of surgeons, fundamentally using a laparoscopic gastric bypass. Initially, the Clavien-Dindo scale was translated and validated for its acceptability and reproducibility using the Kappa index. The scale was then applied to the whole of the bariatric series. A systematic review was also conducted in the literature regarding the use of the Clavien-Dindo classification after bariatric surgery. Lastly, a comparison was made with our results. The classification was validated without any difficulty. Most of the postoperative complications are grades I (8.4%) and III (7.8%). We found it used in 15 series (including our own), which accounts for 10,347 patients. The overall results are analogous to our series. The Clavien-Dindo scale has been validated and translated into Spanish. Application is quick and simple and enables comparisons to be made between centers and series. Our results are similar to those reported by other authors.",10.1016/j.soard.2017.04.018,,,,824
1652,Who would have thought it? An operation proves to be the most effective therapy for adult-onset diabetes mellitus.,"This report documents that the gastric bypass operation provides long-term control for obesity and diabetes. Obesity and diabetes, both notoriously resistant to medical therapy, continue to be two of our most common and serious diseases. Over the last 14 years, 608 morbidly obese patients underwent gastric bypass, an operation that restricts caloric intake by (1) reducing the functional stomach to approximately 30 mL, (2) delaying gastric emptying with a c. 0.8 to 1.0 cm gastric outlet, and (3) excluding foregut with a 40 to 60 cm Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy. Even though many of the patients were seriously ill, the operation was performed with a perioperative mortality and complication rate of 1.5% and 8.5%, respectively. Seventeen of the 608 patients (< 3%) were lost to follow-up. Gastric bypass provides durable weight control. Weights fell from a preoperative mean of 304.4 lb (range, 198 to 615 lb) to 192.2 lb (range, 104 to 466) by 1 year and were maintained at 205.4 lb (range, 107 to 512 lb) at 5 years, 206.5 lb (130 to 388 lb) at 10 years, and 204.7 lb (158 to 270 lb) at 14 years. The operation provides long-term control of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). In those patients with adequate follow-up, 121 of 146 patients (82.9%) with NIDDM and 150 of 152 patients (98.7%) with glucose impairment maintained normal levels of plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and insulin. These antidiabetic effects appear to be due primarily to a reduction in caloric intake, suggesting that insulin resistance is a secondary protective effect rather than the initial lesion. In addition to the control of weight and NIDDM, gastric bypass also corrected or alleviated a number of other comorbidities of obesity, including hypertension, sleep apnea, cardiopulmonary failure, arthritis, and infertility. Gastric bypass is now established as an effective and safe therapy for morbid obesity and its associated morbidities. No other therapy has produced such durable and complete control of diabetes mellitus.",10.1097/00000658-199509000-00011,,,,825
128,Cognitive Control and Weight Loss After Bariatric Surgery: the BARICO Study.,"Bariatric surgery (BS) is an effective treatment for obesity. However, some individuals experience insufficient weight loss after surgery. Therefore, we investigated whether cognitive control affects weight loss after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Within this exploratory observational study, part of the BARICO study (BAriatric surgery Rijnstate and Radboudumc neuroImaging and Cognition in Obesity), participants aged between 35 and 55 years eligible for RYGB were included. Before and after BS, body weight, (delta) BMI and percentage total body weight loss (%TBWL) were determined. Additionally, at baseline, Stroop task-performance, -activation and -connectivity were assessed by a color-word paradigm task during functional neuroimaging to determine the ability of participants to inhibit cognitive interference. Seventy-six participants were included, of whom 14 were excluded from fMRI analysis, leaving 62 participants. Participants were aged 45.0 Â± 5.9 years with a mean pre-surgery BMI of 40.2 Â± 3.3 kg/m2, and 86% were women. Mean decrease in BMI was 13.8 Â± 2.5 kg/m2, and mean %TBWL was 34.9 Â± 6.3% 1 year after BS. Stroop task performance did not correlate with (delta) BMI and %TBWL. The inferior parietal/middle occipital gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and supplementary motor cortex were involved in cognitive interference, although activity in these regions did not predict weight loss after surgery. Lastly, generalized psychophysiological interaction did not provide evidence for (delta) BMI- and %TBWL-dependent connectivity modulation. Cognitive control did not predict weight loss after surgery. Future studies should focus on longer follow-up periods to understand the relation between cognitive control and weight loss.

621,Palliative surgical bypass is superior to palliative endoscopic stenting in patients with malignant gastric outlet obstruction: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Gastrojejunostomy (GJ) and self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) are the two most common palliative treatment options for patients with malignant gastric outlet obstruction (GOO). Randomised trials and retrospective studies have shown discrepant results, so that there is still a controversy regarding the optimal treatment of GOO. Medline, Web of Science and Cochrane Library were systematically searched for studies comparing GJ to SEMS in patients with malignant GOO. Primary outcomes were survival and postoperative mortality. Secondary outcomes were frequency of re-interventions, major complications, time to oral intake and length of hospital stay. Twenty-seven studies, with a total of 2.354 patients, 1.306 (55.5%) patients in the SEMS and 1.048 (44.5%) patients in the GJ group, were considered suitable for inclusion. GJ was associated with significantly longer survival than SEMS (mean difference 43Â days, CI 12.00, 73.70, pâ€‰=â€‰0.006). Postoperative mortality (OR 0.55, CI 0.27, 1.16, pâ€‰=â€‰0.12) and major complications (OR 0.73, CI 0.5, 1.06, pâ€‰=â€‰0.10) were similar in both groups. The frequency of re-interventions, however, was almost three times higher in the SEMS group (OR 2.95, CI: 1.70, 5.14, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), whereas the mean time to oral intake and length of hospital stay were shorter in the SEMS group (mean differences -â€‰5Â days, CI -â€‰6.75, -â€‰3.05Â days, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001 and -â€‰10Â days, CI -â€‰11.6, -â€‰7.9Â days, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001, respectively).

1406,Prophylactic gastrojejunostomy for unresectable periampullary carcinoma.,"The role of prophylactic gastrojejunostomy in patients with unresectable periampullary cancer is controversial. To determine whether prophylactic gastrojejunostomy should be performed routinely in patients with unresectable periampullary cancer. We searched the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2010, issue 3), MEDLINE, EMBASE and Science Citation Index Expanded until April 2010. We included randomised controlled trials comparing prophylactic gastrojejunostomy versus no gastrojejunostomy in patients with unresectable periampullary cancer (irrespective of language or publication status). Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and independently extracted data. We analysed data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models using Review Manager (RevMan). We calculated the hazard ratio (HR), risk ratio (RR), or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on an intention-to-treat or available case analysis. We identified two trials (of high risk of bias) involving 152 patients randomised to gastrojejunostomy (80 patients) and no gastrojejunostomy (72 patients). In both trials, patients were found to be unresectable during exploratory laparotomy. Most of the patients also underwent biliary-enteric drainage. There was no evidence of difference in the overall survival (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.25), peri-operative mortality or morbidity, quality of life, or hospital stay (MD 0.97 days; 95%CI -0.18 to 2.12) between the two groups. The proportion of patients who developed long term gastric outlet obstruction was significantly lower in the prophylactic gastrojejunostomy group (2/80; 2.5%) compared with no gastrojejunostomy group (20/72; 27.8%) (RR 0.10; 95%CI 0.03 to 0.37). The operating time was significantly longer in the gastrojejunostomy group compared with no gastrojejunostomy group (MD 45.00 minutes; 95%CI 21.39 to 68.61). Routine prophylactic gastrojejunostomy is indicated in patients with unresectable periampullary cancer undergoing exploratory laparotomy (with or without hepaticojejunostomy).",10.1002/14651858.CD008533.pub2,,,,828
746,Physical training following gastric bypass: effects on physical activity and quality of life-a randomized controlled trial.,"Obesity is associated with physical inactivity and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We aim to test the hypothesis that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) followed by supervised physical training improves physical activity (PA) levels and HRQoL. Sixty patients, qualified for RYGB, were at 6Â months post-surgery randomized to 26Â weeks of a supervised physical training intervention (INT) or to a control (CON) group. PA was assessed by accelerometry and using the questionnaire RPAQ. HRQoL was measured by the SF-36 questionnaire. All assessments were performed pre-surgery and 6, 12, and 24Â months post-surgery. RYGB did not improve objectively or self-reported PA, but improved all domains of SF-36 (all pâ€‰<â€‰0.01). Objectively measured light PA, moderate to vigorous PA, and step counts tended to increase in INT compared to CON 12Â months after RYGB (0.05â€‰<â€‰pâ€‰<â€‰0.09), but the effects failed to persist. The SF-36 domain ""general health"" increased in INT compared to CON 24Â months after RYGB (pâ€‰=â€‰0.041). RYGB improves HRQoL, but does not increase PA. Supervised physical training intervention improves general health 24Â months after RYGB and tends to improve certain domains of PA right after the intervention period, but fails to increase the patients' overall PA level over time.

996,Postoperative Behavioral Variables and Weight Change 3 Years After Bariatric Surgery.,"Severe obesity (body mass index â‰¥35 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]) is associated with significant medical comorbidity and increased mortality. Bariatric surgery induces weight loss, the extent of which can vary. Postoperative predictors of weight loss have not been adequately examined. To describe postoperative eating behaviors and weight control and their effects on 3-year change in weight. The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 (LABS-2) study is a multicenter observational cohort study at 10 US hospitals in 6 geographically diverse clinical centers. Adults undergoing first-time bariatric surgical procedures as part of routine clinical care were recruited between 2006 and 2009 and followed up until September 2012. Participants completed detailed surveys regarding eating and weight control behaviors prior to surgery and then annually after surgery for 3 years. Twenty-five postoperative behaviors related to eating behavior, eating problems, weight control practices, and the problematic use of alcohol, smoking, and illegal drugs. Behaviors examined were divided into those that were never present (preoperatively or postoperatively), those that were always present (preoperatively and postoperatively), and those that underwent a healthy change after surgery (development of a positive behavior or omission of a negative behavior). The sample included a total of 2022 participants (median age, 47 years [interquartile range, 38-55 years]; median BMI, 46 [interquartile range, 42-51]; 78% women): 1513 who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and 509 who had undergone laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. If we consider the cumulative effects of the 3 behaviors that explain most of the variability (16%) in 3-year percent weight change following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, ie, weekly self-weighing, continuing to eat when feeling full more than once a week, and eating continuously during the day, a participant who postoperatively started to self-weigh, stopped eating when feeling full, and stopped eating continuously during the day after surgery would be predicted to lose a mean (SE) of 38.8% (0.8%) of their baseline weight. This average is about 14% greater weight loss compared with participants who made no positive changes in these variables (mean [SE], -24.6% [1.6%]; mean difference, -14.2%; 95% CI, -18.7% to -9.8%; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001) and 6% greater weight loss compared with participants who always reported positive on these healthy behaviors (mean [SE], -33.2% [0.6%]; mean difference, -5.7%; 95% CI, -7.8% to -3.5%; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). The results suggest the importance of assessing behaviors related to eating behavior, eating problems, weight control practices, and the problematic use of alcohol, smoking, and illegal drugs in bariatric surgery candidates and patients who have undergone bariatric surgery, and they suggest that the utility of programs to modify problematic eating behaviors and eating patterns should be addressed in research.",10.1001/jamasurg.2016.0395,,,,830
1007,"Closure of mesenteric defects in laparoscopic gastric bypass: a multicentre, randomised, parallel, open-label trial.","Small bowel obstruction due to internal hernia is a common and potentially serious complication after laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery. Whether closure of surgically created mesenteric defects might reduce the incidence is unknown, so we did a large randomised trial to investigate. This study was a multicentre, randomised trial with a two-arm, parallel design done at 12 centres for bariatric surgery in Sweden. Patients planned for laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery at any of the participating centres were offered inclusion. During the operation, a concealed envelope was opened and the patient was randomly assigned to either closure of mesenteric defects beneath the jejunojejunostomy and at Petersen's space or non-closure. After surgery, assignment was open label. The main outcomes were reoperation for small bowel obstruction and severe postoperative complications. Outcome data and safety were analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01137201. Between May 1, 2010, and Nov 14, 2011, 2507 patients were recruited to the study and randomly assigned to closure of the mesenteric defects (n=1259) or non-closure (n=1248). 2503 (99Â·8%) patients had follow-up for severe postoperative complications at day 30 and 2482 (99Â·0%) patients had follow-up for reoperation due to small bowel obstruction at 25 months. At 3 years after surgery, the cumulative incidence of reoperation because of small bowel obstruction was significantly reduced in the closure group (cumulative probability 0Â·055 for closure vs 0Â·102 for non-closure, hazard ratio 0Â·56, 95% CI 0Â·41-0Â·76, p=0Â·0002). Closure of mesenteric defects increased the risk for severe postoperative complications (54 [4Â·3%] for closure vs 35 [2Â·8%] for non-closure, odds ratio 1Â·55, 95% CI 1Â·01-2Â·39, p=0Â·044), mainly because of kinking of the jejunojejunostomy. The results of our study support the routine closure of the mesenteric defects in laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery. However, closure of the mesenteric defects might be associated with increased risk of early small bowel obstruction caused by kinking of the jejunojejunostomy.

260,Prevalence and associated factors of secondary hyperparathyroidism after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: A meta-analysis.,"This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL for relevant studies using search terms gastric bypass, RYGB and hyperparathyroidism. Thirty-four cohort studies with 4331 patients were incorporated into the final meta-analysis. Overall estimates of the prevalence of SHPT following RYGB were 39%. Subgroup analyses indicated the pooled prevalences of SHPT were 25%, 42%, 48%, and 54% for â‰¤1â€‰year, >1 and â‰¤5â€‰years, >5 and â‰¤10â€‰years, and >10â€‰years, respectively, after RYGB. Meta-regression showed that SHPT occurred was positively related to follow-up durations (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001). Additionally, SHPT prevalence was higher in studies in which calcium and vitamin D supplementation were considered inadequate than in those which were adequate (pâ€‰=â€‰0.002). SHPT is highly prevalent in individuals with obesity after RYGB. It seems to progress with time after surgery. Routine calcium and vitamin D supplementation post-RYGB together with targeted treatment of vitamin D deficiency, reasonable adjustment of the doses of supplementation with regular follow-up, and improved patient compliance, as well as long-term screening, are necessary to prevent the development of SHPT.",10.1111/obr.13488,,,,832
665,Comparative Effects of Medical Versus Surgical Weight Loss on Body Composition: a Pilot Randomized Trial.,"Bariatric surgery leads to more rapid and greater weight loss (WL) compared to medical weight loss (MWL), but the differences in body composition (BC) changes for these modalities remain unclear. Due to the known health risks associated with central adiposity, we compared the changes in regional distribution of fat mass (FM) and lean mass (LM) after surgical versus MWL. In this 1:1:1 randomized trial among 15 persons with type 2 diabetes and body mass index (BMI) 30-39.9Â kg/m2, we compared changes in BC, by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and abdominal computerized tomography, at time of 10%WL or 9Â months after intervention (whichever came first). Participants underwent MWL, adjustable gastric banding (AGB), or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Non-parametric tests evaluated BC differences (FM, LM, and visceral adipose tissue [VAT]) within and across all three arms and between pair-wise comparisons. Twelve female participants (75% African American) completed the study. Patient age, BMI, and baseline anthropometric characteristics were similar across study arms. AGB lost more LM (MWL -â€‰5.2%, AGB -â€‰10.3%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.021) and VAT (MWL +â€‰10.9%, AGB -â€‰28.0%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.049) than MWL. RYGB tended to lose more VAT (MWL +10.9%, RYGB -â€‰20.2%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.077) than MWL. AGB tended to lose more LM than RYGB (AGB -â€‰12.38%, RYGB -â€‰7.29%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.15). At similar WL, AGB lost more LM and VAT than MWL; RYGB similarly lost more VAT. Given the metabolic benefits of reducing VAT and retaining LM, larger studies should confirm the changes in BC after surgical versus medical WL.

309,"EAES rapid guideline: systematic review, network meta-analysis, CINeMA and GRADE assessment, and European consensus on bariatric surgery-extension 2022.","The European Association for Endoscopic Surgery Bariatric Guidelines Group identified a gap in bariatric surgery recommendations with a structured, contextualized consideration of multiple bariatric interventions. To provide evidence-informed, transparent and trustworthy recommendations on the use of sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, adjustable gastric banding, gastric plication, biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch, one anastomosis gastric bypass, and single anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy in patients with severe obesity and metabolic diseases. Only laparoscopic procedures in adults were considered. A European interdisciplinary panel including general surgeons, obesity physicians, anesthetists, a psychologist and a patient representative informed outcome importance and minimal important differences. We conducted a systematic review and frequentist fixed and random-effects network meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) using the graph theoryÂ approach for each outcome. We calculated the odds ratio or the (standardized) mean differences with 95% confidence intervals for binary and continuous outcomes, respectively. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the CINeMA and GRADE methodologies. We considered the risk/benefit outcomes within a GRADE evidence to decision framework to arrive at recommendations, which were validated through an anonymous Delphi process of the panel. We identified 43 records reporting on 24 RCTs. Most network information surrounded sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Under consideration of the certainty of the evidence and evidence to decision parameters, we suggest sleeve gastrectomy or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass over adjustable gastric banding, biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch and gastric plication for the management of severe obesity and associated metabolic diseases. One anastomosis gastric bypass and single anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy are suggested as alternatives, although evidence on benefits and harms, and specific selection criteria is limited compared to sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

46,Impact of Gastrojejunostomy Anastomosis Diameter on Weight Loss Following Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass: A Systematic Review.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is crucial for significant weight reduction and treating obesity-related issues. However, the impact of gastrojejunostomy (GJ) anastomosis diameter on weight loss remains unclear. We investigate this influence on post-RYGB weight loss outcomes. A systematic search was conducted. Six studies met the inclusion criteria, showing varied GJ diameters and follow-up durations (1-5Â years). Smaller GJ diameters generally correlated with greater short-to-medium-term weight loss, with a threshold beyond which complications like stenosis increased. Studies had moderate-to-low bias risk, emphasizing the need for precise GJ area quantification post-operation. This review highlights a negative association between smaller GJ diameters and post-RYGB weight loss, advocating for standardized measurement techniques. Future research should explore intra-operative and AI-driven methods for optimizing GJ diameter determination.",10.1007/s11695-024-07237-x,,,,835
1262,Effect of billroth II or Roux-en-Y reconstruction for the gastrojejunostomy on delayed gastric emptying after pancreaticoduodenectomy: a randomized controlled study.,"Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) is one of the major complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), occurring in 14% to 61% of cases. There have been no studies that compare the incidence of DGE in terms of the reconstruction method of gastrojejunostomy performed in subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (SSPPD). The objective of this study was to evaluate the superiority of Billroth II (B-II) to Roux-en Y (R-Y) reconstruction on decreasing the incidence of delayed gastric emptying DGE after SSPPD by a prospective randomized controlled trial. Between April 2008 and August 2011, 101 patients who underwent SSPPD for pancreatic head or periampullary diseases were randomly allocated to B-II reconstruction (n = 52) and R-Y reconstruction (n = 49) groups. The primary endpoint was incidence of DGE. DGE occurred in 5.7% of patients in the B-II group and in 20.4% of patients in the R-Y group (P = 0.028). Patients in the B-II group had a significantly shorter hospital stay after operation than patients in the R-Y group (31.6 Â± 15.0 days vs. 41.4 Â± 20.5 days, P = 0.037). In terms of postoperative complications, the incidence of pancreatic fistula was significantly higher in patients with DGE (38.5%) than in patients without DGE (14.8%) (P = 0.037). It is suggested that the incidence of DGE after SSPPD can be decreased by using B-II rather than R-Y reconstruction for gastrojejunostomy.(Clinical Trials Registry, UMIN-CTR: http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/, ref no.

837,A Meta-Analysis of GLP-1 After Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass: Impact of Surgical Technique and Measurement Strategy.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is an effective treatment for diabetes. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a gut hormone that is important to glucose homeostasis. This study aimed to assess GLP-1 level and its predictors after RYGB. The study design was a meta-analysis. The data sources were MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Databases. The study selection composed of studies with pre- and post-RYGB levels. The main outcomes were as follows: Primary outcome was the change in postprandial GLP-1 levels after RYGB. Secondary outcomes included the changes in fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and fasting GLP-1 levels after RYGB. Meta-regression to determine predictors of changes in GLP-1 levels was performed. Outcomes were reported using Hedge's g. Twenty-four studies with 368 patients were included. Postprandial GLP-1 levels increased after RYGB (Hedge's gÂ =Â 1.29, pÂ <Â 0.0001), while fasting GLP-1 did not change (pÂ =Â 0.23). Peak postprandial GLP-1 levels gave the most consistent results (I 2Â =Â 9.11). Fasting glucose and insulin levels decreased after RYGB (pÂ <Â 0.0001). Roux limb length was a significant predictor for amount of GLP-1 increase (Î²Â =Â -Â 0.01, pÂ =Â 0.02). Diabetes status, amount of weight loss, length of biliopancreatic limb, and time of measurement were not significant predictors (pÂ >Â 0.05). Postprandial GLP-1 levels increase after RYGB, while fasting levels remain unchanged. Shorter Roux limb length is associated with greater increase in postprandial GLP-1, which may lead to better glycemic control in this population.",10.1007/s11695-017-2913-1,,,,838
38,Contribution of Ultra-Processed Foods to Weight Gain Recurrence 5 Years After Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate evolution of ultra-processed food intake and recurrent weight gain in patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This study is an observational longitudinal study that evaluated patients who underwent metabolic and bariatric surgery at four time points: before surgery and at 3, 12, and 60Â months after surgery. Anthropometric and dietary intake data were collected through two 24-h dietary recalls. All foods consumed were classified according to degree of processing. Recurrent weight gain was considered the difference between current weight and nadir weight. The sample consisted of 58 patients with a mean age of 38.7â€‰Â±â€‰8.9Â years and 68% female. After 60Â months, mean excess weight loss and recurrent weight gain were 73.6â€‰Â±â€‰27.2% and 22.5â€‰Â±â€‰17.4%. Calorie and macronutrient intake decreased significantly between the pre-surgery period, and 3 and 12Â months post-surgery; however, there was no significant difference after 60Â months. In relation to food groups or macronutrients, no difference was observed between the pre-surgery period and 60Â months post-surgery. The contribution of unprocessed or minimally processed foods to calorie intake gradually decreased after 3Â months post-surgery. The profile of dietary intake after 60Â months of metabolic and bariatric surgery tends to approach that of the pre-surgery period. The contribution of unprocessed and minimally processed foods to calorie intake decreased after 60Â months, while ultra-processed food contribution increased.",10.1007/s11695-024-07291-5,,,,839
257,"A single, peri-operative antibiotic can persistently alter the post-operative gut microbiome after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.","Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) significantly alters the gut microbiome and may be a mechanism for post-operative cardiovascular disease improvement. We have previously found an association between the class of peri-operative, intravenous antibiotic administered at the time of RYGB and the resolution rate of hypertension suggesting the gut microbiome as a mechanism. In this study, we performed a prospective study of RYGB to determine if a single intravenous antibiotic could alter the gastrointestinal microbial composition. Patients undergoing RYGB were randomized to a single, peri-operative antibiotic of intravenous cefazolin (nâ€‰=â€‰8) or clindamycin (nâ€‰=â€‰8). Stool samples were collected from four-time points: 2 weeks pre-op (- 2w), 2 days pre-op (- 2d), 2 weeks post-op (+â€‰2w) and 3 months post-op (+â€‰3m). Stool samples were processed for genomic DNA followed by Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing (MGS). A total of 60 stool samples (- 2w, nâ€‰=â€‰16; - 2d, nâ€‰=â€‰15;â€‰+â€‰2w, nâ€‰=â€‰16;â€‰+â€‰3m, nâ€‰=â€‰13) from 16 patients were analyzed. 87.5% of patients were female with an average age of 48.6â€‰Â±â€‰12.2Â years and pre-operative BMI of 50.9â€‰Â±â€‰23.3Â kg/m2. RYGB induced statistically significant differences in alpha and beta diversity. There were statistically significant differences in alpha diversity atâ€‰+â€‰2w and beta diversity atâ€‰+â€‰3m due to antibiotic treatment. MGS revealed significantly distinct gut microbiota with 11 discriminatory metagenomic assembled genomes driven by antibiotic treatment at 3 months post-op, including increased Bifidobacterium spp. with clindamycin. RYGB induces significant changes in the gut microbiome at 2Â weeks that are maintained 3Â months after surgery. However, the single peri-operative dose of antibiotic administered at the time of RYGB induces unique and persisting changes to the gut microbiome that are antibiotic-specific. Increased Bifidobacterium spp. with clindamycin administration may improve the metabolic efficacy of RYGB when considering gut-microbiome driven mechanisms for blood pressure resolution.",10.1007/s00464-022-09387-4,,,,840
192,Does Bariatric Surgery Reduce the Risk of Colorectal Cancer in Individuals with Morbid Obesity? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Bariatric surgery has shown to be effective in producing sustained weight loss and the resolution of obesity related medical problems. Recent research focused on the role of obesity and adipose tissue in tumorigenesis, finding a strong crosslink through different mechanisms and highlighting an increase in cancer incidence in individuals with obesity. The aim of this meta-analysis is to find if bariatric surgery reduces the incidence of colorectal cancer in patients with obesity. We performed a meta-analysis including 18 studies (PROSPERO ID: CRD4202235931). Bariatric surgery was found to be significantly protective toward colorectal cancer incidence in individuals with obesity (HR: 0.81, p = 0.0142). The protective effect persisted when considering women (RR: 0.54, p = 0.0014) and men (RR: 0.74, p = 0.2798) separately, although this was not significant for the latter. No difference was found when comparing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. Bariatric surgery reduces the incidence of colorectal cancer in individuals with obesity independently from gender and surgical procedure. Prospective large cohort studies are needed to confirm these findings.",10.3390/nu15020467,,,,841
755,Influence of Drain Placement on Postoperative Pain Following Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass for Morbid Obesity: Randomized Controlled Trial.,"There is currently no evidence to support the routine use of an abdominal drain following laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Our aim was to investigate drain use in laparoscopic RYGB and its effects on postoperative pain. Sixty-six patients were randomly divided into two groups as no-drain (nâ€‰=â€‰36) and with-drain (nâ€‰=â€‰30). Intraoperative (time, blood loss, complications) and postoperative outcomes (morbidities, pain scores, hospital stay) were compared. Demographics of both groups were comparable. Three patients in the no-drain group required a drain (8.3%). Median visual analog scale scores for days 1-3 for with-drain and no-drain groups were 4.5 (2-9) vs. 3 (0-8) (pâ€‰=â€‰0.02), 3 (0-7) vs. 2 (0-7) (pâ€‰=â€‰0.10), and 2 (0-7) vs. 0 (0-4) (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0004), respectively. There was no difference between the groups in terms of complications and length of hospital stay. Drain use increased the postoperative pain following laparoscopic RYGB. Drain placement following laparoscopic RYGB should be selective instead of a routine application.",10.1007/s11695-018-3374-x,,,,842

All subjects completed three questionnaires (GI symptoms, food preferences, and quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) and three 24-h recalls. At one year postoperatively, both surgical groups showed similar percentage of excess weight loss that exceeded 50%. In addition, percentage of carbohydrate, protein, and sugar intake from total energy, frequency of daily consumption from the eight food categories and daily energy intake were comparable between surgical groups. RYGB subjects consumed significantly more fruits and juices from total energy (P < 0.05) whereas SG subjects tended to consume more sweets and desserts. Heartburn (P < 0.001), regurgitation (P < 0.01), nausea (P < 0.01), vomiting (P < 0.001), and constipation (P < 0.05) were significantly more frequent among SG subjects. Flatulence (P < 0.001) and diarrhea (P < 0.05), as well as dizziness (P < 0.001), and fast heartbeat (P < 0.05) after eating were significantly more frequent after RYGB. There were no major differences in dietary intake and food preferences between RYGB and SG groups. There was a trend for sweet-eating in SG subjects with less dumping symptoms to suggest different mechanisms of action for each procedure, which might impact eating behavior.",10.1007/s11695-015-1713-8,,,,843
1192,Diagnostic markers of postoperative morbidity after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for obesity.,"The main objective of this study was to detect subacute complications that can arise from laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and take a rational approach to manage these complications. A prospective observational study was performed from November 2010 to December 2012. All patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery for morbid obesity were included in this study. Patients with complications before day 5 were excluded from the study. Clinical and laboratory data (C-reactive protein, leukocyte count) at postoperative day 5, 30-day morbidity, were recorded. The diagnostic value of C-reactive protein (CRP) and leukocytes were determined by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. One hundred and twenty-six patients were included. The overall incidence of 30-day morbidity was 8.7 %, and anastomotic leakage rate was 3.2 %. C-reactive protein at postoperative day 5 was a good predictor of complications (AUC was 0.862 (95 % CI [0.76; 0.96]; p < 0.001) and anastomotic leakage (AUC was 0.863 (95 % CI [0.66; 1]; p = 0.014). A CRP cutoff level of 136 mg/l at postoperative day 5 yielded a specificity of 95.5 % and a sensitivity of 57.1 % for the detection of postoperative complications. The negative predictive value was 94.6 %. A CRP level of 136 mg/l at day 5 was significantly associated with postoperative morbidity. C-reactive protein dosage at postoperative day 5 is a relevant predictor of postoperative complications permitting to select patients at risk. Radiological examination and close monitoring could be restricted to patients with CRP level exceeding 136 mg/l.",10.1007/s00423-014-1180-z,,,,844
131,Postprandial plasma GLP-1 levels are elevated in individuals with postprandial hypoglycaemia following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass - a systematic review.,"Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment in individuals with obesity to achieve remission of type 2 diabetes. Post-bariatric surgery hypoglycaemia occurs frequently, and management remains suboptimal, because of a poor understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. The glucoregulatory hormone responses to nutrients in individuals with and without post-bariatric surgery hypoglycaemia have not been systematically examined. The study protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane databases were searched for publications between January 1990 and November 2021 using MeSH terms related to post-bariatric surgery hypoglycaemia. Studies were included if they evaluated individuals with post-bariatric surgery hypoglycaemia and included measurements of plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), insulin, C-peptide and/or glucagon concentrations following an ingested nutrient load. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was also evaluated. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed, and Hedges' g (standardised mean difference) and 95% confidence intervals were reported for all outcomes where sufficient studies were available. The Ï„2 estimate and I2 statistic were used as tests for heterogeneity and a funnel plot with the Egger regression-based test was used to evaluate for publication bias. From 377 identified publications, 12 were included in the analysis. In all 12 studies, the type of bariatric surgery was Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Comparing individuals with and without post-bariatric surgery hypoglycaemia following an ingested nutrient load, the standardised mean difference in peak GLP-1 was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.32, 0.82), peak GIP 0.05 (-0.26, 0.36), peak insulin 0.84 (0.44, 1.23), peak C-peptide 0.69 (0.28, 1.1) and peak glucagon 0.05 (-0.26, 0.36). HbA1c was less in individuals with hypoglycaemia -â€‰0.40 (-0.67, -0.12). There was no evidence of substantial heterogeneity in any outcome except for peak insulin: Ï„2â€‰=â€‰0.2, I2â€‰=â€‰54.3. No publication bias was evident. Following RYGB, postprandial peak plasma GLP-1, insulin and C-peptide concentrations are greater in individuals with post-bariatric surgery hypoglycaemia, while HbA1c is less. These observations support the concept that antagonism of GLP-1 would prove beneficial in the management of individuals with hypoglycaemia following RYGB.PROSPERO Registration Number: CRD42021287515.",10.1007/s11154-023-09823-3,,,,845
1036,Effect of probiotics on postoperative quality of gastric bypass surgeries: a prospective randomized trial.,"Gastric bypass surgery is the recommended treatment for severely obese patients. However, postoperative symptomatic gastrointestinal (GI) episodes are common complaints. To determine if administration of probiotics improves symptomatic GI episodes after gastric bypass surgery. Hospital-based bariatric center. This double-blind, randomized trial was conducted between March 2010 and September 2010 with 60 patients who underwent gastric bypass for severe obesity and experienced postoperative symptomatic GI episodes. Patients were randomly assigned to the probiotics group A (n = 20; 1 g Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI twice daily); probiotics group B (n = 20; Bifidobacterium longum BB536 twice daily); or digestive enzymes group (n = 20; Aczym, containing 100 mg takadiastase N, 20 mg cellulase AP, 50 mg lipase MY, and 100 mg pancreatin, twice daily). Quality of life was measured using the modified Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (mGIQLI) before and after the 2-week intervention. Preintervention patient characteristics and mGIQLI scores were similar among the 3 groups. After the 2-week intervention, the mean mGIQLI score improved from 57.4 to 63.9 points in the entire sample and also within each group for 7 items specifically for 7: excessive passage of gas, foul smell of flatulence, belching, heartburn, abdominal noises, abdominal bloating, and abdominal pain. Administration of probiotics or digestive enzymes may improve symptomatic GI episodes after gastric bypass surgeries and improve quality of life, at least initially.",10.1016/j.soard.2015.07.010,,,,846
926,Blood pressure reduction after gastric bypass surgery is explained by a decrease in cardiac output.,"Blood pressure (BP) decreases in the first weeks after Roux-and-Y gastric bypass surgery. Yet the pathophysiology of the BP-lowering effects observed after gastric bypass surgery is incompletely understood. We evaluated BP, systemic hemodynamics, and baroreflex sensitivity in 15 obese women[mean age 42 Â± 7 standard deviation (SD) yr, body mass index 45 Â± 6 kg/m2] 2 wk before and 6 wk following Roux-and-Y gastric bypass surgery. Six weeks after gastric bypass surgery, mean body weight decreased by 13 Â± 5 kg (10%, P < 0.001). Office BP decreased from 137 Â± 10/86 Â± 6 to 128 Â± 12/81 Â± 9 mmHg (P < 0.001, P < 0.01), while daytime ambulatory BP decreased from 128 Â± 14/80 Â± 9 to 114 Â± 10/73 Â± 6 mmHg (P = 0.01, P = 0.05), whereas nighttime BP decreased from 111 Â± 13/66 Â± 7 to 102 Â± 9/62 Â± 7 mmHg (P = 0.04, P < 0.01). The decrease in BP was associated with a 1.6 Â± 1.2 l/min (20%, P < 0.01) decrease in cardiac output (CO), while systemic vascular resistance increased (153 Â± 189 dynÂ·sÂ·cm-5, 15%, P < 0.01). The maximal ascending slope in systolic blood pressure decreased (192 mmHg/s, 19%, P = 0.01), suggesting a reduction in left ventricular contractility. Baroreflex sensitivity increased from 9.0 [6.4-14.3] to 13.8 [8.5-19.0] ms/mmHg (median [interquartile range]; P < 0.01) and was inversely correlated with the reductions in heart rate (R = -0.64, P = 0.02) and CO (R = -0.61, P = 0.03). In contrast, changes in body weight were not correlated with changes in either BP or CO. The BP reduction following Roux-and-Y gastric bypass surgery is correlated with a decrease in CO independent of changes in body weight. The contribution of heart rate to the reduction in CO together with enhanced baroreflex sensitivity suggests a shift toward increased parasympathetic cardiovascular control. The reason for the decrease in blood pressure (BP) in the first weeks after gastric bypass surgery remains to be elucidated. We show that the reduction in BP following surgery is caused by a decrease in cardiac output. In addition, the maximal ascending slope in systolic blood pressure decreased suggesting a reduction in left ventricular contractility and cardiac workload. These findings help to understand the physiological changes following gastric bypass surgery and are relevant in light of the increased risk of heart failure in these patients.",10.1152/japplphysiol.00362.2016,,,,847
1462,"Alterations in proinsulin and insulin dynamics, HDL Cholesterol and ALT after gastric bypass surgery. A 42-months follow-up study.","Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) powerfully reduces type 2 diabetes (T2DM) incidence. Proinsulin predicts development of T2DM. Adjustable gastric banding is associated with lowered proinsulin but after RYGBP information is scant. Twenty-one non-diabetic morbidly obese patients who underwent RYGBP surgery were evaluated before (baseline), at 12 months (first follow-up), and at 42 months, range 36-50 (second follow-up), after surgery and compared to a control group, matched at baseline regarding fasting glucose, insulin, proinsulin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and body mass index (BMI). In the RYGBP group, fasting serum proinsulin concentrations were markedly lowered from 13.5 to 3.5 pmol/l at first follow-up and to 4.9 pmol/l at second follow-up (p < 0.001, respectively). Fasting insulin concentrations were reduced from 83.4 to 24.6 pmol/l at first follow-up (p < 0.001) and to 36.4 pmol/l at second follow-up (p < 0.01). ALT was lowered from 0.62 to 0.34 mukatal/l at first follow-up and continued to lower to 0.24 mukatal/l at second follow-up (p < 0.001, respectively). The further decrease between first and second follow-up was also significant (p = 0.002). HDL cholesterol increased from 1.16 to 1.45 mmol/l at the first follow-up and continued to increase at second follow-up to 1.58 mmol/l (p < 0.001, respectively). The further increase between first and second follow-up was also significant (p = 0.006). The differences between groups at first follow-up were significant for BMI, proinsulin, insulin, ALT, and HDL cholesterol (p = 0.04-0.001). RYGBP surgery in morbidly obese patients is not only characterized by markedly and sustained lowered BMI but also lowered concentrations of proinsulin, insulin, and ALT and increased HDL cholesterol.",10.1007/s11695-009-9806-x,,,,848
863,Baseline Anthropometric and Metabolic Parameters Correlate with Weight Loss in Women 1-Year After Laparoscopic Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass.,"In this study, we explored in a prospective cohort of morbidly obese women undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGP) correlations between baseline anthropometrics, metabolic parameters, resting energy expenditure (REE), body composition, and 1-year % excess body mass index loss (%EBMIL). We also investigated risk factors for insufficient %EBMIL. One hundred three consecutive women were prospectively evaluated at baseline (age 40.6Â Â±Â 11.2, weight 113.9Â kgÂ Â±Â 15.3, BMI 43.3Â Â±Â 4.9Â kg/m2) and 1Â year after LRYGP. Weight, excess weight, brachial circumference, waist circumference, fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) (measured with bioelectrical impedance analysis), REE, inflammation, insulin resistance, and lipid disturbances were determined before and 1Â year after LRYGP. At 1Â year, mean weight loss was 39.8Â kgÂ Â±Â 11.7 and mean EBMIL was 15.2Â kg/m2Â Â±Â 4.2. Mean %EBMIL was 86%Â Â±Â 21% (range 30-146%). Baseline brachial circumference, waist circumference and triceps skinfold thickness decreased significantly at 1Â year (PÂ <Â 0.001). Blood glucose and insulin levels, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and CRP also decreased significantly (PÂ <Â 0.001). The mean loss of initial FFM and FM was 9.1Â kgÂ Â±Â 8.2 (15%) and 30.7Â kgÂ Â±Â 11.8 (53%), respectively. REE on body weight ratio (REE/BW) increased from 15.3Â kcal/kgÂ Â±Â 2.8 to 18.4Â kcal/kgÂ Â±Â 2.5 (pÂ <Â 0.0001) and REE on FFM ratio decreased from 31.2 to 28.7Â kcal/day/kg (pÂ <Â 0.001). Preoperative waist circumference (rÂ =Â -0.3; PÂ <Â 0.001), blood glucose level (rÂ =Â -0.37; PÂ <Â 0.001), and CRP (rÂ =Â -0.28; PÂ =Â 0.004) were negatively correlated with EBMIL% 1Â year after surgery. Among baseline body composition parameters, only preoperative FM was negatively correlated with %EBMIL (rÂ =Â -0.23; pÂ =Â 0.02). One year after surgery FM change was negatively correlated with EBMIL% (rÂ =Â -0.49; PÂ <Â 0.001) while FFM/BW ratio was positively correlated with %EBMIL (rÂ =Â 0.71; PÂ <Â 0.001). Increase in REE/BW at 1Â year was positively correlated with %EBMIL (rÂ =Â 0.47; pÂ <Â 0.001). On multivariate analysis, baseline blood glucose level (ORÂ =Â 1.77; CI 95%: [1.3-2.4]) was the only predictive factor of EBMIL <60% at 1Â year. LRYGB has beneficial effects on clinical, biological parameters, and body composition. Increasing the proportion of FFM on total BW and REE/BW is associated with better results in terms of weight loss. Baseline glucose level may be helpful in identifying poor responders to LRYGBP.

825,Korean OBEsity Surgical Treatment Study (KOBESS): protocol of a prospective multicentre cohort study on obese patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Bariatric surgery effectively induces long-term weight loss in Western populations. However, its effectiveness in Asians remains to be confirmed objectively. The Korean Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery proposes the first prospective cohort study on Koreans undergoing bariatric surgery. The Korean OBEsity Surgical treatment Study (KOBESS) is a prospective, multicentre, single-arm, observational, cohort study on morbidly obese patients who undergo primary sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in Korea. In total, 100 consecutive obese Asian patients who will undergo bariatric surgery will be recruited in 2016-2017; follow-up will be for 1â€‰year. Primary outcomes are change in body weight and waist circumference at 1â€‰year. All patients will undergo anthropometry, laboratory tests, bioelectrical impedance analysis, gastrofibroscopy, polysomnography and fat-measuring CT before and after surgery. Patients with diabetes will also undergo perioperative oral glucose tolerance and endocrinological hormone tests. Hypertensive patients will also undergo perioperative echocardiography and carotid Doppler ultrasonography. Female patients suspected of having polycystic ovarian syndrome will also undergo perioperative hormone tests and abdominal ultrasonography. Visceral and subcutaneous fat will be harvested during surgery. Blood, stool and urine samples will be taken at various perioperative time points. Although the cohort is small and the follow-up duration is relatively short, this study will determine whether bariatric surgery induces satisfactory weight loss in obese Koreans. Significantly, the tissue samples will also facilitate many studies examining the effects of bariatric surgery and their mechanisms. Ethics approval was obtained from the institutional review board of each participating hospital. All findings arising from this cohort study will be published in open-access peer-reviewed journals and will be presented at national and international meetings. All KOBESS investigators will be able to propose research studies and potential publications based on KOBESS data and tissue samples. NCT03100292; Pre-results.",10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018044,,,,850
953,The effect of surgical and non-surgical weight loss on N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and its relation to obstructive sleep apnea and pulmonary function.,"Obesity is a major risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea, impaired pulmonary function and heart failure, but obesity is also associated with paradoxically low levels of serum N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). In subjects with severe obesity undergoing weight loss treatment, we assessed the associations between changes in severity of obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary function and serum NT-proBNP levels. One-year non-randomized controlled clinical trial. Participants, 69.6Â % women, mean (SD) age 44.6 (10.8) years and body mass index (BMI) 45.1 (5.6) kg/m(2), underwent gastric bypass surgery (nÂ =Â 76) or intensive lifestyle intervention (nÂ =Â 63), resulting in 30 (8) % and 8 (9) % weight loss, respectively. The reference group included 30 normal weight, healthy, gender and age matched controls. Sleep recordings, arterial blood gases, pulmonary function and blood tests were assessed before and 1Â year after the interventions. NT-proBNP concentrations increased significantly more after surgery than after lifestyle intervention. The post intervention values in both groups were significantly higher than in a normal weight healthy reference group. In the whole study population changes (âˆ†) in NT-proBNP correlated significantly with changes in both BMI (rÂ =Â -0.213) and apnea hypopnea index (AHI, rÂ =Â -0.354). âˆ†NT-proBNP was, independent of age, gender and âˆ†BMI, associated with âˆ†AHI (beta -0.216, pÂ =Â 0.021). âˆ†AHI was, independent of âˆ†BMI, significantly associated with changes in pO2 (beta -0.204), pCO2 (beta 0.199), forced vital capacity (beta -0.168) and forced expiratory volume first second (beta -0.160). Gastric bypass surgery was associated with a greater increase in NT-proBNP concentrations than non-surgical weight loss treatment. Reduced AHI was, independent of weight loss, associated with increased NT-proBNP levels and improved dynamic lung volumes and daytime blood gases.

1244,A comparison of duloxetine plasma levels in postbariatric surgery patients versus matched nonsurgical control subjects.,"Bariatric surgery such as the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is currently used as a treatment for severe obesity. Alteration of the gastrointestinal tract by this procedure suggests a potential for clinically significant alterations in the bioavailability of ingested medications including antidepressants. The purpose of this trial was to determine to what extent the RYGB procedure alters the area under the plasma concentration/time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) of the antidepressant, duloxetine. Ten subjects who were 1 year post-RYGB where compared with healthy control subjects matched for body mass index, age, and sex. Ultrarapid or poor metabolizers for cytochrome P450 2D6 were excluded from the study. Subjects received a single dose of 60 mg of duloxetine. Nineteen plasma samples were obtained during 72 hours to characterize the plasma level profile. The mean AUC(0-infinity) was significantly smaller for the postbariatric surgery (PBS) group (646.74 ng Ã— h/mL [SD, 79.70; range, 539.57-791.62], P = 0.017) compared to the nonsurgical control group (1119.91 ng Ã— h/mL [SD, 593.40; range, 415.5-2426.56]). The Tmax was also significantly shorter for the PBS group (2.2 hours) compared to the nonsurgical control group (6 hours; P = 0.005). No significant difference in Cmax or half-life was identified. To our knowledge, this is the first reported study exploring duloxetine pharmacokinetics PBS. This trial found that the bariatric surgery group was exposed to only 57.7% of duloxetine as compared to the nonsurgery group. This finding suggests that clinicians need to monitor patients closely after bariatric surgery and that further exploration of the effects of bariatric surgery on antidepressant pharmacokinetic parameters is warranted.",10.1097/JCP.0b013e3182905ffb,,,,852
1511,A randomized trial of bupivicaine pain pumps to eliminate the need for patient controlled analgesia pumps in primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"The use of a bupivicaine pain pump has previously been reported to lower costs to hospitals, while providing similar pain relief to opioid-based patient controlled analgesia (PCA) pumps. However, these benefits have not been investigated in laparoscopic bariatric surgery. We prospectively randomized 40 laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP) patients into two groups. The first group received the ON-Q bupivicaine pain pump placed subxiphoid and radiating in both directions caudally beneath the lowest rib. The second group was treated with a meperidine PCA, which was initiated in the PACU and discontinued at 06:00 hrs the following morning. Both groups had identical surgery, anesthesiologists, anesthesia protocol and postoperative nausea prophylaxis. There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to age, sex, pain scores, nausea scores, gas pain scores, antiemetic use throughout their stay, or opioid use in the PACU. However, there was a dramatic decrease in opioid use between the two groups over the time interval from leaving the PACU to 06:00 hrs (meperidine by PCA mean 217 mg vs ON-Q 129 mg meperidine equivalents, P=0.008). The use of a bupivicaine pain pump offers the opportunity to dramatically reduce the use of opioids postoperatively in all bariatric patients by eliminating PCA. This change could potentially reduce the incidence of respiratory failure from oversedation, while offering the same levels of pain control.",10.1007/s11695-007-9103-5,,,,853
723,Serum FABP4 concentrations decrease after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass but not after intensive medical management.,"Serum concentrations of fatty acid binding protein 4, an adipose tissue fatty acid chaperone, have been correlated with insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk factors. The objective of this study were to assess relationships among Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, intensive lifestyle modification and medical management protocol, fatty acid binding protein 4, and metabolic parameters in obese patients with severe type 2 diabetes mellitus; and to evaluate the relative contribution of abdominal subcutaneous adipose and visceral adipose to the secretion of fatty acid binding protein 4. Participants were randomly assigned to intensive lifestyle modification and medical management protocol (nâ€¯=â€¯29) or to intensive lifestyle modification and medical management protocol augmented with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (nâ€¯=â€¯34). Relationships among fatty acid binding protein 4 and demographic characteristics, metabolic parameters, and 12-month changes in these values were examined. Visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue explants from obese nondiabetic patients (nâ€¯=â€¯5) were obtained and treated with forskolin to evaluate relative secretion of fatty acid binding protein 4 in the different adipose tissue depots. The intensive lifestyle modification and medical management protocol and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass cohorts had similar fasting serum fatty acid binding protein 4 concentrations at baseline. At 1 year, mean serum fatty acid binding protein 4 decreased by 42% in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass participants (Pâ€¯=â€¯.002) but did not change significantly in the intensive lifestyle modification and medical management protocol cohort. Percentage of weight change was not a significant predictor of 12-month fatty acid binding protein 4 within treatment arm or in multivariate models adjusted for treatment arm. In adipose tissue explants, fatty acid binding protein 4 was secreted similarly between visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue. After Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, fatty acid binding protein 4 is reduced 12 months after surgery but not after intensive lifestyle modification and medical management protocol in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Fatty acid binding protein 4 was secreted similarly between subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue explants.",10.1016/j.surg.2018.08.007,,,,854
842,Delayed Gastric Emptying in Side-to-Side Gastrojejunostomy in Pancreaticoduodenectomy: Result of a Propensity Score Matching.,"Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) is one of the most common morbidities of pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). The aim of this study was to clarify whether the incidence of DGE can be reduced by side-to-side gastric greater curvature-to-jejunal anastomosis in subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (SSPPD). The clinical data of 253 patients who had undergone PD were examined. Of a total of 188 patients who had undergone SSPPD, a gastrojejunostomy (GJ) was performed with end-to-side anastomosis in 87 patients (SSPPD-ETS group), and a GJ was performed with a greater curvature side-to-jejunal side anastomosis in 101 patients (SSPPD-STS group). After propensity score matching, the matched cohort consisted of 74 patients in each group. The postoperative data were evaluated according to the International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery grade of DGE. The total incidence of DGE was 9.4% in the SSPPD-ETS group and 4% in the SSPPD-STS group, with no significant difference (pÂ =Â 0.1902). A significant difference was observed between the two groups in the incidence of DGE grade C (pÂ =Â 0.0426). The incidence of total DGE was not reduced statistically in the STS group compared with the ETS group, but reduced DGE grade C. Side-to-side anastomosis might be associated with a reduced incidence of DGE grade C.",10.1007/s11605-017-3540-9,,,,855
963,The FKBP5 polymorphism rs1360780 is associated with lower weight loss after bariatric surgery: 26 months of follow-up.,"Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment choice for severe obesity. Recent literature indicates that FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) could play a role in energy homeostasis, influencing adipogenesis and weight. To evaluate if the presence of the T allele of the FKBP5 SNP rs1360780, associated with increased FKBP51 expression, could influence weight loss after bariatric surgery. Hospital de ClÃ­nicas de Porto Alegre, Brazil. Forty-two patients awaiting bariatric surgery were included, and the presence of the FKBP5 rs1360780 polymorphism was evaluated. During the postoperative period, a 26-month follow-up of weight loss was performed (n = 42, 36, 35, 35, and 30, from the first to fifth postoperative evaluation, respectively; loss to follow-up: 28.6%). Carriers of the T allele presented significantly lower weight loss compared with patients with the C/C genotype after the 12th to 14th month follow-up period. Differences in weight loss between genotypes ranged from 14.2% to 19.9% of excess weight loss (P = .045 and .004, respectively) and from 7.6% to 9.0% of total weight loss (P = .002 for both comparisons). Furthermore, carriers of the T allele also presented an earlier cessation of weight loss after surgery. The presence of the T allele of the FKBP5 SNP rs1360780 was associated with weight loss after bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery can interact with genes involved in metabolic regulation, leading to different weight loss outcomes.",10.1016/j.soard.2016.04.016,,,,856
701,Effect of alcohol ingestion on plasma glucose kinetics after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) increases the rate of alcohol absorption so that peak blood alcohol concentration is 2-fold higher after surgery compared with concentrations reached after consuming the same amount presurgery. Because high doses of alcohol can lead to hypoglycemia, patients may be at increased risk of developing hypoglycemia after alcohol ingestion. We conducted 2 studies to test the hypothesis that the consumption of approximately 2 standard drinks of alcohol would decrease glycemia more after RYGB than before surgery. Single-center prospective randomized trial. We evaluated plasma glucose concentrations and glucose kinetics (assessed by infusing a stable isotopically labelled glucose tracer) after ingestion of a nonalcoholic drink (placebo) or an alcoholic drink in the following groups: (1) 5 women before RYGB (body mass indexâ€¯=â€¯43 Â± 5 kg/m2) and 10 Â± 2 months after RYGB (body mass indexâ€¯=â€¯31 Â± 7 kg/m2; study 1), and (2) 8 women who had undergone RYGB surgery 2.2 Â± 1.2 years earlier (body mass indexâ€¯=â€¯30 Â± 5 kg/m2; study 2) RESULTS: Compared with the placebo drink, alcohol ingestion decreased plasma glucose both before and after surgery, but the reduction was greater before (glucose nadir placeboâ€¯=â€¯-.4 Â± 1.0 mg/dL versus alcoholâ€¯=â€¯-9.6 Â± 1.5 mg/dL) than after (glucose nadir placeboâ€¯=â€¯-1.0 Â± 1.6 mg/dL versus alcoholâ€¯=â€¯-5.5 Â± 2.6 mg/dL; P < .001) surgery. This difference was primarily due to an alcohol-induced early increase followed by a subsequent decrease in the rate of glucose appearance into systemic circulation. RYGB does not increase the risk of hypoglycemia after consumption of a moderate dose of alcohol.",10.1016/j.soard.2018.10.021,,,,857
315,SHORTEN PREOPERATIVE FASTING AND INTRODUCING EARLY EATING ASSISTANCE IN RECOVERY AFTER GASTROJEJUNAL BYPASS?,"The metabolic response to surgical trauma is enhanced by prolonged preoperative fasting, contributing to increased insulin resistance. This manifestation is more intense on the 1st and 2nd postoperative days and is directly proportional to the size of the operation. To compare whether preoperative fasting abbreviation and early postoperative refeeding associated with intraoperative and postoperative fluid restriction interfere in the evolution of patients undergoing gastrojejunal bypass. Eighty patients indicated for Roux-en-Y gastrojejunal bypass were selected. They were randomly divided into two groups: Ringer Lactate (RL) group, who underwent a 6 hours solids fasting, with the administration of 50 g of maltodextrin in 100 ml of mineral water 2 hours before the beginning of anesthesia; and Physiologic Solution (PS) group, who underwent a 12 hours solids and liquids fasting. Anesthesia was standardized for both groups. During the surgical procedure, 1500 ml of ringer lactate solution was administered in the RL and 2500 ml of physiological solution (0.9% sodium chloride) in the PS. In both groups, the occurrence of bronchoaspiration was analyzed during intubation, and the residual gastric volume was measured after opening the abdominal cavity. In the postoperative period in Group RL, patients started a liquid diet 24 hours after the end of the operative procedure; whilst for PS group, fasting was maintained for the first 24 hours, it was prescripted 2000 ml of physiological solution and a restricted liquid diet after 36 hours. Each patient underwent CPK, insulin, sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine, PaCO2, pH and bicarbonate dosage in the immediate postoperative period, and 48 hours later, the exams were repeated. There were no episodes of bronchoaspiration and gastrojejunal fistulas in either group. In the analysis of the residual gastric volume of the PS and RL groups, the mean volumes were respectively 16.5 and 8.8, which shows statistical significance between the groups. In laboratory tests, there was no difference between groups in sodium; PS group showed a higher level of serum potassium (p=0.029); whilst RL group showed a higher urea and creatinine values; CPK values were even for both; PS group demonstrated a higher insulin level; pH was higher in PS group; sodium bicarbonate showed a significant difference at all times; PaCO2 values in RL group was higher than in PS. In the analysis of the incidence of nausea and flatus, no statistical significance was observed between the groups. The abbreviation of preoperative fasting and early postoperative refeeding of Roux-en-Y gastrojejunal bypass with the application of ERAS or ACERTO Project accelerated the patient's recovery, reducing residual gastric volume and insulin level, and do not predispose to complications.",10.1590/0102-672020210003e1606,,,,858
521,The Effect of Bariatric Surgery on Oral Antibiotic Absorption: a Systematic Review.,"The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the existing literature to determine the effect of bariatric surgery on various pharmacokinetic parameters of oral antibiotic absorption as well as overall patient outcomes. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched up to February 2020. Outcomes of interest included change in pharmacokinetic parameters of oral antibiotics administered to patients following bariatric surgery, using variables such as maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), clearance, and volume of distribution. MINORS and Cochrane risk of bias tools were used to assess quality of evidence. Ten studies with 100 patients assessing 8 oral antibiotics were included. The majority (77%) of patients underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), with fewer undergoing ventral banded gastroplasty (VBG) (14%), jejunoileostomy (6%), and jejunoileal bypass (3%). Antibiotic classes investigated included beta-lactams (5 studies), fluoroquinolones (2 studies), macrolides (2 studies), and oxazolidinones (1 study). Heterogeneity between studies precluded meaningful pooling or meta-analysis of data. Overall risk of bias was fair. Patients given oral beta-lactams and macrolides warrant close monitoring due to unpredictable absorption post-bariatric surgery, whereas oral fluoroquinolones and linezolid may not be affected. Several studies also showed decreased absorption following RYGB, as well as lower serum exposure in patients with obesity compared to non-obese controls. Clinicians should monitor patients on a case-by-case basis for signs of antibiotic failure or toxicity and reassess dosing accordingly.",10.1007/s11695-020-04623-z,,,,859
144,Endoscopic-Directed Trans-Gastric Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography in Patients With Roux-en-Y gastric Bypasses: A Meta-Analysis.,"Endoscopic ultrasound-directed trans-gastric retrograde cholangiopancreatography (EDGE) is a new procedure for treating pancreaticobiliary diseases in patients with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The aim of this metaâ€‘analysis was to determine the overall outcomes and safety of EDGE. We performed a computerized search of the main databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Science Citation Index, through October 2022. The main outcome measures examined in the meta-analysis were technical and clinical success rates and overall adverse event (AE) rate, especially the lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) dislodgement rate. AE rates were assessed according to LAMS size (15 vs. 20Â mm), number of stages (single vs. two) and access route (gastrogastric vs. jejuno-gastric). Fourteen trials with a total of 574 patients who had undergone 585 EDGE procedures were included in this study. The cumulative technical and clinical success and AE rates were 98%, 94%, and 14%, respectively. The commonest AE was LAMS dislodgement (rate 4%). The overall AE rate was lower in the 20-mm LAMS than in the 15-mm LAMS group (odds ratio [OR]=5.79; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.35 to 14.29). There were no significant differences in AE rate between number of stages (OR=1.36; 95% CI: 0.51 to 3.64) or differing access routes (OR=1.03; 95% CI 0.48 to 2.22). We here provide evidence that EDGE for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography yields good treatment outcomes in patients with RYGBs. The AE rate is significantly lower with 20-mm versus 15-mm LAMS; thus, the former is likely preferable.",10.1097/MCG.0000000000001864,,,,860
847,Liver Function in Patients With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Randomized to Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Versus Sleeve Gastrectomy: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.,"The aim of the study was to compare the influence of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on liver function in bariatric patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in a randomized clinical trial (NCT01806506). Rapid weight loss and malabsorption after bariatric surgery in patients with NAFLD or steatohepatitis (NASH) may impair liver function. Sixty-six morbidly obese patients randomized to SG or RYGB were included in a secondary outcome analysis. Intraoperative liver biopsies were categorized with NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) and liver function tests were done before surgery and after 1, 6 and 12 months. NASH was present in 54.5% RYGB and 51.5% SG patients (P > 0.05). At 12 months excess weight loss was 68.7â€ŠÂ±â€Š19.7% after SG and 62.8â€ŠÂ±â€Š18.5% after RYGB (P > 0.05). At 1 month international normalized ratio (INR) increased after RYGB (0.98â€ŠÂ±â€Š0.05 vs 1.14â€ŠÂ±â€Š0.11; P < 0.05) and SG (0.99â€ŠÂ±â€Š0.06 vs 1.04â€ŠÂ±â€Š0.06; P < 0.05), RYGB induced significantly greater increase in INR in the whole group and NASH patients than SG. After RYGB albumin decreased at 1 month (41.2â€ŠÂ±â€Š2.7 vs 39.0â€ŠÂ±â€Š3.2â€Šg/L; P < 0.05). At 12 months, INR and albumin returned to baseline. At 12 months in NASH group, SG induced significant improvement in aspartate aminotransferase (32.4â€ŠÂ±â€Š17.4 vs 21.5â€ŠÂ±â€Š6.9U/L), alanine aminotransferase (39.9â€ŠÂ±â€Š28.6U/L vs 23.8â€ŠÂ±â€Š14.1U/L), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (34.3â€ŠÂ±â€Š16.6 vs 24.5â€ŠÂ±â€Š16.8U/L), and lactate dehydrogenase (510.8â€ŠÂ±â€Š33 vs 292.4â€ŠÂ±â€Š29). Variables predictive of INR change after 1 month included operation type, NAS â‰¥ 5, bilirubin, body mass index, hemoglobin A1C, and dyslipidemia. Patients with NASH undergoing RYGB are more susceptible to early transient deterioration of liver function than after SG.",10.1097/SLA.0000000000002397,,,,861
1425,The importance of caloric restriction in the early improvements in insulin sensitivity after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.,"Many of the metabolic benefits of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) occur before weight loss. In this study we investigated the influence of caloric restriction on the improvements in the metabolic responses that occur within the 1st week after RYGB. RESEARCH METHODS AND DESIGN: A mixed meal was administered to nine subjects before and after RYGB (average 4 +/- 0.5 days) and to nine matched, obese subjects before and after 4 days of the post-RYGB diet. Weight loss in both groups was minimal; the RYGB subjects lost 1.4 +/- 5.3 kg (P = 0.46) vs. 2.2 +/- 1.0 kg (P = 0.004) in the calorically restricted group. Insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance) improved with both RYGB (5.0 +/- 3.1 to 3.3 +/- 2.1; P = 0.03) and caloric restriction (4.8 +/- 4.1 to 3.6 +/- 4.1; P = 0.004). The insulin response to a mixed meal was blunted in both the RYGB and caloric restriction groups (113 +/- 67 to 65 +/- 33 and 85 +/- 59 to 65 +/- 56 nmol x l(-1) x min(-1), respectively; P < 0.05) without a change in the glucose response. Glucagon-like peptide 1 levels increased (9.2 +/- 8.6 to 12.2 +/- 5.5 pg x l(-1) x min(-1); P = 0.04) and peaked higher (45.2 +/- 37.3 to 84.8 +/- 33.0 pg/ml; P = 0.01) in response to a mixed meal after RYGB, but incretin responses were not altered after caloric restriction. These data suggest that an improvement in insulin resistance in the 1st week after RYGB is primarily due to caloric restriction, and the enhanced incretin response after RYGB does not improve postprandial glucose homeostasis during this time.",10.2337/dc09-2107,,,,862
1561,Design and rationale of the Utah obesity study. A study to assess morbidity following gastric bypass surgery.,"This paper details the design and baseline characteristics of a study on the morbidity associated with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (GBP) in severely obese adults. This study is designed to assess the effectiveness of GBP in reducing morbidity and maintaining weight loss. A wide array of clinical tests and psycho-behavioral questionnaires are included as part of the study. Three groups (n=1156 severely obese) have been recruited for this study: cases who were approved for and participated in surgery (n=415), a control group of GBP seeking individuals who were denied surgery (n=420) and a control group that was randomly chosen from a population of severely obese participants who were not seeking GBP (n=321). Clinical measures include: a physician interview and detailed medical history, resting electro- and echocardiograms, a submaximal exercise treadmill test and electrocardiogram, pulmonary function, limited polysomnography, resting metabolic rate, anthropometrics, resting and exercise blood pressure, comprehensive blood chemistry and urinalysis and dietary, quality of life and physical activity questionnaires. Most participants (76%) were tested following an overnight stay in a clinical research center. Remaining participants underwent less extensive testing in an outpatient clinic. Baseline characteristics of the 1156 participants are available for selected measures. Mean+/-S.D. for BMI was 46+/-7.5 kg/m(2) (range=33 to 92) and for age was 44+/-11.4 years (range=18 to 72). The prevalence of diabetes and hypertension was 19% and 35%, respectively. Of the participants who had an echocardiogram or polysomnogram, 92% had left-ventricular hypertrophy and 85% had mild to severe sleep apnea. The two control groups were similar to the surgical group. At approximately 24 months, all participants will have a second clinical examination. Statistical comparisons of changes in morbidity variables will be made between the surgical and control groups. This study design facilitates assessment of risks and benefits of GBP to perform recommendations on whether or not to perform surgery on the severely obese patient. Baseline and 2-year exams provide valuable data for comparison to future long-term follow-up data that can be collected at 5 and 10 years.",10.1016/j.cct.2005.05.003,,,,863
1011,"Gastric Band Removal in Revisional Bariatric Surgery, One-Step Versus Two-Step: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.","We aimed to systematically review the literature comparing the safety of one-step versus two-step revisional bariatric surgery from laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG). There is debate on the safety of removing the gastric band and performing revisional surgery immediately or in a delayed, two-step fashion due to potential higher complications in one-step revisions. A systematic and comprehensive search of the literature was conducted. Included studies directly compared one-step and two-step revisional surgery. Eleven studies were included with 1370 patients. Meta-analysis found comparable rates of complications, morbidity, and mortality between one-step and two-step revisions for both RYGB and SG groups. This suggests that immediate or delayed revisional bariatric surgeries are both safe options for LAGB revisions.",10.1007/s11695-016-2082-7,,,,864
1213,"Early impact of bariatric surgery on type II diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia: a systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression on 6,587 patients.","This study aims to evaluate the 12-24-month impact of bariatric surgery on the foremost modifiable traditional risk factors of cardiovascular disease. A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective interventional studies reporting the most commonly performed laparoscopic surgical procedures, i.e., Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), adjustable gastric banding (AGB), and cardiovascular risk reduction after surgery. The bibliographic research conducted independently by two authors yielded 18 records. When looking at RYGB and AGB separately, we observed a relevant heterogeneity (I (2) index â‰¥87Â %) when BMI reduction was considered as the main outcome. When hypertension, type II diabetes, and hyperlipidemia risk reduction was estimated, a highly significant beneficial effect was found. The risk reduction was 0.33 [0.26; 0.42] for type II diabetes, 0.52 [0.42; 0.64] for hypertension, and 0.39[0.27; 0.56] for hyperlipidemia (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001 for all outcomes considered). When looking at surgical technique separately, a higher but not statistically significant risk reduction for all outcomes considered was found. Results from the meta-regression approach showed an inverse relation between cardiovascular risks and BMI reduction. The present study showed an overall reduction of cardiovascular risk after bariatric surgery. According to our analysis a BMI reduction of 5 after surgery corresponds to a type II diabetes reduction of 33Â % (as reported by Peluso and Vanek (Nutr Clin Pract 22(1):22-28, 2007); SAS Institute Inc., (2000-2004)), a hypertension reduction of 27Â % (as reported by Buchwald and Oien (Obes Surg 23(4):427-436, 2013); Valera-Mora et al. (Am J Clin Nutr 81(6):1292-1297, 2005)), and a hyperlipidemia reduction of 20Â %(as reported by Adams et al. (JAMA 308(11):1122-31, 2012)); Alexandrides et al. (Obes Surg 17(2):176-184, 2007). In summary, our study showed that laparoscopic bariatric surgery is an effective therapeutic option to reduce the cardiovascular risk in severe obese patients.",10.1007/s11695-013-1121-x,,,,865
342,Microbiome Changes after Type 2 Diabetes Treatment: A Systematic Review.,"Background and objectives: Although the role of the gut microbiome in type 2 diabetes (T2D) pathophysiology is evident, current systematic reviews and meta-analyses analyzing T2D treatment mainly focus on metabolic outcomes. The objective of this study is to evaluate the microbiome and metabolic changes after different types of treatment in T2D patients. Materials and Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Wiley online library, Science Direct, and Cochrane library electronic databases was performed. Randomized controlled clinical trials published in the last five years that included T2D subjects and evaluated the composition of the gut microbiome alongside metabolic outcomes before and after conventional or alternative glucose lowering therapy were selected. Microbiome changes were evaluated alongside metabolic outcomes in terms of bacteria taxonomic hierarchy, intestinal flora biodiversity, and applied intervention. Results: A total of 16 eligible studies involving 1301 participants were reviewed. Four trials investigated oral glucose-lowering treatment, three studies implemented bariatric surgery, and the rest analyzed probiotic, prebiotic, or synbiotic effects. The most common alterations were increased abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria parallel to improved glycemic control. Bariatric surgery, especially Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, led to the highest variety of changed bacteria phyla. Lower diversity post-treatment was the most significant biodiversity result, which was present with improved glycemic control. Conclusions: Anti-diabetic treatment induced the growth of depleted bacteria. A gut microbiome similar to healthy individuals was achieved during some trials. Further research must explore the most effective strategies to promote beneficial bacteria, lower diversity, and eventually reach a non-T2D microbiome.",10.3390/medicina57101084,,,,866
662,"Bariatric surgery as a model to explore the basis and consequences of the Reaven hypothesis: Small, dense low-density lipoprotein and interleukin-6.","Reaven originally described the clustering of insulin resistance/hyperinsulinaemia, obesity (particularly visceral), altered cytokine levels, glucose intolerance, hypertriglyceridaemia and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Subsequently, a potentially highly atherogenic small, dense low-density lipoprotein was also reported. We have studied the effect of bariatric surgery on this and other risk factors for atherosclerosis. Forty patients (20 with type 2 diabetes mellitus) undergoing bariatric surgery were studied before and 1â€‰year after bariatric surgery. Twelveâ€‰months after bariatric surgery, median body mass index had decreased from 49.5 to 36.5â€‰kg/m2, fasting insulin from 21.3 to 7.8â€‰mU/L and insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance) from 5.9 to 1.8 (all pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Thirteen out of 20 patients had remission from type 2 diabetes mellitus. Highly sensitive C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, fasting triglycerides ( pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and small, dense low-density lipoprotein ( pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) decreased, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased ( pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) significantly, irrespective of having type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or being treated with statin therapy before surgery. The association between marked weight loss and change in insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia with the change in small, dense low-density lipoprotein and interleukin-6 warrants further investigation. Bariatric surgery provides a model for investigating the mechanisms linking insulin resistance/hyperinsulinaemia to atherosclerosis.",10.1177/1479164119826479,,,,867
1257,Very low-calorie diet mimics the early beneficial effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on insulin sensitivity and Î²-cell Function in type 2 diabetic patients.,"Marked improvement in glycemic control occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus shortly after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) and before there is major weight loss. The objective of this study was to determine whether the magnitude of this change is primarily due to caloric restriction or is unique to the surgical procedure. We studied eleven subjects who underwent RYGB and fourteen subjects mean-matched for BMI, HbA1c, and diabetes duration who were admitted to our inpatient research unit and given a very low-calorie diet (VLCD) of 500 kcal/day with a macronutrient content similar to that consumed by patients after RYGB. Frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed before and after interventions. Both groups lost an equivalent amount of weight over a mean study period of 21 days. Insulin sensitivity, acute insulin secretion after intravenous glucose administration, and Î²-cell function as determined by disposition index improved to a similar extent in both groups. Likewise, changes in fasting glucose and fructosamine levels were similar. Based on these data, VLCD improves insulin sensitivity and Î²-cell function just as well as RYGB in the short term.",10.2337/db12-1762,,,,868
734,Shifts in intestinal microbiota after duodenal exclusion favor glycemic control and weight loss: a randomized controlled trial.,"In recent years, studies indicate gut microbiota as an important modulator in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. Environmental and genetic factors interact to control the host's intestinal microbiota, triggering metabolic disorders such as obesity and insulin resistance. The objective of this study was to identify the fecal microbiota in adult type 2 diabetes patients and to assess changes in composition after metabolic surgery. University Hospital of the University of SÃ£o Paulo. Twenty-one patients were enrolled in a randomized controlled study divided into 2 arms. One group underwent duodenal-jejunal bypass surgery with minimal gastric resection, and fecal samples were collected before the operation and after 6 and 12 months. The other group received medical care (standard care group) and was followed for 12 months. Fecal samples were collected at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. Fecal microbiota was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing with V4 16 S rRNA primers. The fecal microbiota in duodenal-jejunal bypass surgery with minimal gastric resection group (Bacteroides, Akkermansia, and Dialister) exhibited increased abundance and diversity compared with that in the standard care group; however, the increase in A. muciniphila was only statistically significant in the surgical group, probably due to the study's small sample size. The data presented suggest that duodenal-jejunal bypass surgery with minimal gastric resection increases microbial richness and abundancy, mainly for those bacteria related to weight loss and metabolic control (Akkermansia), providing a better understanding of the role of microbiota in type 2 diabetes regulation and its changes after metabolic surgery.",10.1016/j.soard.2018.07.021,,,,869
1043,Preoperative Nutrition and Postoperative Discomfort in an ERAS Setting: A Randomized Study in Gastric Bypass Surgery.,"Many patients experience postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Preoperative treatment with carbohydrate solutions seems to improve the course after different types of surgery. This study was undertaken to investigate the potential value of different models for preoperative hydration/nutrition, in addition to our ERAS (enhanced recovery after surgery) protocol. Ninety non-diabetic women planned for elective laparoscopic gastric bypass and aged 18-65 years were included. All were on preoperative low-calorie diet (LCD). They were randomized into three arms, either a carbohydrate-rich drink, a protein-enriched drink, or tap water and instructed to drink 800 and 200 mL 16 and 2 h, respectively, prior to operation. Risk factors for PONV were recorded preoperatively. All patients were operated before lunch and received 1500-2000 mL of Ringer-Acetate solution during the 24-30-h postoperative hospital time. Four variables (nausea, pain, tiredness, and headache) were registered on 100-mm visual analog scales six times over 22 h. The need for additional medication was registered. Out of 90 patients, 73 complete datasets were obtained. Nausea peaked at 7 p.m. but with no statistically significant differences between groups for any of the variables. Pain peaked the first 2 h postoperatively, remained longer, and had not returned to baseline values at 6 a.m. the morning after surgery but with no difference between groups. Inside our ERAS protocol, additional preoperative carbohydrate- or protein-enriched fluid treatment did not further reduce immediate patient discomfort in laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery.",10.1007/s11695-015-1848-7,,,,870
1490,Mechanical versus suture fixation of the port in adjustable gastric banding procedures: a prospective randomized blinded study.,"Laparoscopic adjustable gastric band port placement can require 9-25% of total implantation time. Prolonged port fixation combined with extended wound manipulation results in an elevated incidence of port-related complications (infection, port tension, pain, rotation). This study compared port fixation using a novel applier to traditional fixation using nonresorbable sutures. From Dec 2005 to March 2006, 50 patients were enrolled into a prospective randomized study. Intra- and postoperative outcomes of placing the Swedish Adjustable Gastric Band((R)) (SAGB) Realize with Velocity port and fixation device (group A) were compared to those of the SAGB with its titanium suture-fixation port (group B). Patient characteristics, port implantation duration, incision length, postoperative port-site pain [via visual analogue scale (VAS)], pain medication, and complications were recorded. Minimum follow-up was 12 months (three visits). Postoperative evaluation was performed by an investigator not involved in the surgery. Patient groups were comparable in age, sex, and body mass index. In group A versus group B, mean port implantation time was lower (53.5 +/- 13.1 versus 451.3 +/- 84.9 s, p < 0.0001), port-site skin incision was longer (mean 4.1 +/- 0.2 versus 3.1 +/- 0.2 cm, p < 0.0001), and postoperative opioid consumption was less (mean 1.3 versus 3.0 units, p < 0.01). Group A reported less mean pain on the VAS (3.2 versus 3.8, p < 0.01); 0/25 group A versus 3/25 group B patients required hypnotics. There were no discernible differences between groups in hospitalization (mean 2.9 days), nursing requirements, or pain at 3, 6, and 12 months. In group A, no patient required reoperation for a port complication; two port rotations occurred in group B (NS). Velocity mechanical port applier fixation is superior in efficiency to port suture fixation, safely increasing the speed to port implant from nearly 8 min to under 1 min and decreasing total operative time by 19%. Port applier fixation trends to reduction of major complications and statistically significantly lessens the minor complication of port-site pain.",10.1007/s00464-008-9882-3,,,,871
1528,"A double-blinded, prospective randomized controlled trial of intraperitoneal bupivacaine in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.","Intraperitoneal local anesthetics have been investigated in several laparoscopic procedures that demonstrate improved postoperative pain control and reduced length of hospital stay. No published studies to date address the effectiveness of IP local anesthetics in laparoscopic gastric bypass patients (LRYGB). Between October 2004 and March 2005, 133 patients were prospectively studied to evaluate the efficacy of IP bupivacaine (IPB) in LRYGB. Patients were randomized to receive either bupivacaine (study group) or saline (control group), which was administered over the esophageal hiatus before dissection and bypass. All procedures were performed in a University-affiliated community-based hospital by three experienced laparoscopic gastric bypass surgeons. Outcomes variables included postoperative pain and narcotic use, length of stay, antiemetic use, cost, and pulmonary function. There were 65 patients within the study group and 68 control patients, with equivalent patient demographics (p > 0.05). A statistically significant decrease in oral narcotic (hydrocodone/acetaminophen, Lortab Elixir, UCB) use was seen in the experimental group relative to the control group (23.8 +/- 2.2 mL versus 33.7 +/- 3.0 mL). Material cost was greater by $0.36 per patient in the study group. All other outcomes variables (ie, length of stay, postoperative IV narcotic use, incentive spirometer volumes, visual analog pain scale, and antiemetic use) showed no considerable differences. IPB use during LRYGB revealed a statistically significant difference only in postoperative oral narcotic use. Possibly, the IPB can limit or prevent peritoneal irritation and reduce the need for longer narcotic use. Clinical significance was not demonstrated by our outcomes variables.",10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2006.12.013,,,,872
471,Procedural Outcomes of Laparoscopic-Assisted Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography in Patients with Previous Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"To investigate the procedural outcomes of laparoscopic-assisted endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in patients with previous Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. We performed a systematic review in accordance with PRISMA statement standards to identify all studies reporting procedural outcomes of laparoscopic-assisted ERCP in patients with previous RYGB. The ROBINS-I tool was used to assess the risk of bias of the included studies. Fixed-effect and random-effects models were applied to calculate pooled outcome data. A total of 17 case series, enrolling 256 patients, were included. The mean age of included patients was 49. The mean procedure time was 137Â min (95% CI 102-172). In terms of procedural success rates, the overall technical success was 95.3% (95% CI 92.5-97.5, I2Â =â€‰0%), papillary access success was 95.3% (95% CI 92.5-97.5, I2Â =â€‰0%), cannulation success was 95.3% (95% CI 92.5-97.5, I2Â =â€‰0%), sphincterotomy success was 96.1% (95% CI 93.5-98.1, I2Â =â€‰0%), and stone removal success was 95.9% (95% CI 92.4-98.4, I2Â =â€‰0%). Conversion to open was required in 4.7% (95% CI 2.5-7.6, I2Â =â€‰0%). In terms of complications, pancreatitis occurred in 4.7% (95% CI 2.3-8, I2Â =â€‰17%), cholangitis in 1.7% (95% CI 0.5-3.6, I2Â =â€‰0%), and perforation in 3.7% (95% CI 1.8-6.3, I2Â =â€‰0%). The length of hospital stay was 3Â days (95% CI 2-4). Laparoscopic-assisted ERCP seems to be feasible, effective, and a safe method to access the biliary tract in patients with previous RYGB as indicated by high technical success rates and low complication rates. There is a need for comparative evidence regarding outcomes of laparoscopic ERCP in comparison with alternative treatment options.",10.1007/s11695-020-04954-x,,,,873
178,"Changes in dietary intake, food tolerance, hedonic hunger, binge eating problems, and gastrointestinal symptoms after sleeve gastrectomy compared with after gastric bypass; 1-year results from the Oseberg study-a randomized controlled trial.","The randomized Oseberg study compared the effects of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), on the 1-y remission of type 2 diabetes and Î²-cell function (primary outcomes). However, little is known about the comparable effects of SG and RYGB on the changes in dietary intakes, eating behavior, and gastrointestinal discomfort. To compare 1-y changes in intakes of macro- and micronutrients, food groups, food tolerance, hedonic hunger, binge eating, and gastrointestinal symptoms after SG and RYGB. Among others, prespecified secondary outcomes were dietary intake, food tolerance, hedonic hunger, binge eating, and gastrointestinal symptoms assessed with a food frequency questionnaire, food tolerance questionnaire, Power of food scale, Binge eating scale, and Gastrointestinal symptom rating scale, respectively. A total of 109 patients (66% females), with mean (SD) age 47.7 (9.6) y and body mass index of 42.3 (5.3) kg/m2, were allocated to SG (n = 55) or RYGB (n = 54). The SG group had, compared with the RYGB group, greater 1-y reductions in the intakes of: protein, mean (95% CI) between-group difference, -13 (-24.9, -1.2) g; fiber, -4.9 (-8.2, -1.6) g; magnesium, -77 (-147, -6) mg; potassium, -640 (-1237, -44) mg; and fruits and berries, -65 (-109, -20) g. Further, the intake of yogurt and fermented milk products increased by >2-folds after RYGB but remained unchanged after SG. In addition, hedonic hunger and binge eating problems declined similarly after both surgeries, whereas most gastrointestinal symptoms and food tolerance remained stable at 1 y. The 1-y changes in dietary intakes of fiber and protein after both surgical procedures, but particularly after SG, were unfavorable with regard to current dietary guidelines. For clinical practice, our findings suggest that health care providers and patients should focus on sufficient intakes of protein, fiber, and vitamin and mineral supplementation after both SG and RYGB.

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.","This study assesses the differences in postoperative nutritional status between laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). We searched the literature from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library database. Twenty-nine articles were included, with a total of 5437 obese patients. After bariatric surgery, the LSG group had less anemia and iron deficiency anemia than the LRYGB group. The serum iron, ferritin deficiency, and vitamin B12 rates after LSG were lower than patients receiving LRYGB. And PTH and serum phosphorus concentration of patients after LSG were both lower than those after LRYGB. The postoperative results of LSG were better than that of LRYGB. Therefore, we recommend LSG for a better postoperative nutrition, but only for reference.",10.1007/s11695-020-04488-2,,,,875
919,Reduction of coagulability state one year after bariatric surgery.,"Obese patients are in a hypercoagulable state relative to normal-weight patients. Low-grade inflammation may be a key factor for this condition. Our study aimed to compare the coagulability state of morbidly obese patients before and 1 year after bariatric surgery (BS) using the Thrombin Generation (TG) test, a validated method to assess coagulation in vitro. University hospital. All patients undergoing BS between September 1, 2014 and April 30, 2015 were eligible for this prospective study (n = 42). Two distinct reagents were used for TG initiation based on the tissue factor concentration (Reagents LOW and HIGH). The main outcomes were endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) and peak height of TG. The rate of follow-up after one year was 97%. One year after surgery, %weight loss was 32.5Â±8.4%; CRP decreased from 9.0 (3.7-12.9) to 1.1 (0.3-2.8) mg/mL (P<.001) and fibrinogen from 4.2Â±.8 to 3.5Â±.8 g/L (P<.001). The ETP (%) decreased from (108.0 (95.0-117.0) to 78.0 (71.0-98.0) (P<.001) (LOW reagent) and from 113.0 (103.0-134.0) to 96.0 (86.0-107.0) (P<.001) (HIGH reagent).

1250,Effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or diabetes support and education on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in morbidly obese patients with type 2 diabetes.,"The long-term changes in insulin sensitivity and Î²-cell function in morbidly obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery or standard medical care remain unclear. We prospectively studied longitudinal changes of glucostatic parameters in morbidly obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus undergoing RYGB surgery or diabetes support and education (DSE). Sixty-one morbidly obese subjects (41.7 Â± 0.6 kg/m) with type 2 diabetes mellitus were assigned to RYGB surgery (n = 30) or DSE (n = 31). They were matched for sex, age, and body weight. Insulin sensitivity index (Si) and acute insulin response (AIR) were derived from frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. Body composition was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. General linear model with repeated measures was used to examine the longitudinal changes (baseline, 6 months, 12 months) in these parameters. At 12-month follow-up, significant improvement in obesity measures, body composition, glucose homeostasis, Si, and AIR was observed after RYGB surgery and weight loss. These outcomes were not influenced by preoperative insulin use. Although there were no significant changes in the body composition among DSE subjects, they experienced a decline in the Si and AIR, along with an increase in fasting glucose and HbA1c. The between-group differences in Si and AIR at 12-month follow-up were completely attenuated with adjustment to changes in body weight. The long-term effects of RYGB surgery on glucostatic parameters are partly dependent on weight loss. In morbidly obese patients with diabetes who were offered DSE, a progressive decline in the glucose homeostasis and glucostatic parameters is observed despite absence of weight gain.

1613,Effect of prolonged pneumoperitoneum on intraoperative urine output during laparoscopic gastric bypass.,"Intraoperative oliguria is common during laparoscopic operations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of prolonged pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic gastric bypass (GBP) on intraoperative urine output and renal function. 104 patients with a body mass index between 40 and 60 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to laparoscopic (n = 54) or open (n = 50) GBP. Intraoperative urine output was recorded at 30-min intervals. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were measured at baseline and on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3. Levels of antidiuretic hormone, aldosterone, and plasma renin activity were also measured in a subset of laparoscopic (n = 22) and open (n = 24) GBP patients at baseline, 2 hours after surgical incision, and in the recovery room. The laparoscopic and open groups were similar in age, gender, and body mass index. There was no significant difference in amount of intraoperative fluid administered between groups (5.4 +/- 1.6 L, laparoscopic versus 5.8 +/- 1.7 L, open), but operative time was longer in the laparoscopic group (232 min versus 200 min, p < 0.01). Urinary output during laparoscopic GBP was 64% lower than during open GBP at 1 hour after surgical incision (19 mL versus 55 mL, p < 0.01) and continued to remain lower than that of the open group by 31-50% throughout the operation. Postoperative blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels remained within the normal range in both groups. Serum levels of antidiuretic hormone, aldosterone, and plasma renin activity peaked at 2 hours after surgical incision with no significant difference between the two groups. Prolonged pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic gastric bypass significantly reduced intraoperative urine output but did not adversely alter postoperative renal function.",10.1016/s1072-7515(02)01321-2,,,,878
1035,Dose response of exercise training following roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery: A randomized trial.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery can cause profound weight loss and improve overall cardiometabolic risk factors. Exercise (EX) training following RYGB can provide additional improvements in insulin sensitivity (SI ) and cardiorespiratory fitness. However, it remains unknown whether a specific amount of EX post-RYGB is required to achieve additional benefits. We performed a post hoc analysis of participants who were randomized into either a 6-month structured EX program or a health education control (CON). The EX group (nâ€‰=â€‰56) was divided into tertiles according to the amount of weekly exercise performed, compared with CON (nâ€‰=â€‰42): low-EXâ€‰=â€‰54â€‰Â±â€‰8; middle-EXâ€‰=â€‰129â€‰Â±â€‰4; and high-EXâ€‰=â€‰286â€‰Â±â€‰40 min per week. The high-EX lost a significantly greater amount of body weight, total fat mass, and abdominal deep subcutaneous abdominal fat compared with CON (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.005). SI improved to a greater extent in both the middle-EX and high-EX compared with CON (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.04). Physical fitness (VO2 max) significantly improved in the high-EX (9.3%â€‰Â±â€‰4.2%) compared with CON (-6.0â€‰Â±â€‰2.4%) (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Skeletal muscle mitochondrial State 4 (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.002) and 3 (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.04) respiration was significantly higher in the high-EX compared with CON. A modest volume of structured exercise provides additional improvements in insulin sensitivity following RYGB, but higher volumes of exercise are required to induce additional weight loss, changes in body composition, and improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness and skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity.",10.1002/oby.21332,,,,879
129,Could Glycated Hemoglobin be Leakage Predictor in Sleeve Gastrectomy? A Retrospective Observational Study on 4233 Patients.,"Diabetes increases the risks related to surgery. At the same time, bariatric surgery improves diabetes. Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) is an index of diabetes severity. The purpose of this study is to evaluate A1C as a possible predictor of postoperative complications after Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG), focusing on leakage. Monocentric retrospective study considering all consecutive patients with obesity, with or without diabetes, who underwent bariatric surgical procedures, from January 2018 to December 2021. All patients had preoperative A1C values. 4233 patients were considered. 522 patients (12.33%) were diabetics (A1Câ€‰â‰¥â€‰6.5%). Of these, 260 patients (6.14%) had A1Câ€‰â‰¥â€‰7% and 59 (1.39%) A1Câ€‰â‰¥â€‰8%. 1718 patients (40.58%) were in a pre-diabetic range (A1C 5.7%-6.5%). Higher A1C values were associated with older age, male gender, higher BMI and increased rate of comorbidities. A longer operative time was observed for patients with A1Câ€‰â‰¥â€‰7%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.027 (53â€‰Â±â€‰20 vs 51â€‰Â±â€‰18Â min). The frequency of leakage was significantly higher when A1Câ€‰â‰¥â€‰7% (3.8% vs 2.0%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.026). The frequency of leakage further increased when A1Câ€‰â‰¥â€‰8% (5.1%), although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Patients with obesity and A1Câ€‰â‰¥â€‰7% need to be referred to a diabetologist to treat diabetes before surgery and consequently decrease the risk of leakage.",10.1007/s11695-023-06754-5,,,,880
998,Prospective 30-Day Outcome Evaluation of a Fast-Track Protocol for 23-Hour Ambulatory Primary and Revisional Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in 820 Consecutive Unselected Patients.,"Results from validated national databases suggest that a 1-day length of stay (LOS) is not only unattainable in more than 20% of primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) operations, but it is also associated with an increased 30-day mortality risk. There are no published data regarding the feasibility and safety of 1-day LOS after revisional LRYGB. We reviewed 1 surgeon's experience after implementation of a 1-day fast-track protocol (FTP) in 784 primary and 36 revisional consecutive LRYGB patients. Patient demographics, comorbidities, preoperative laboratory values, diagnostic work-up, operative characteristics, LOS, 30-day outcomes, and patient satisfaction scores were prospectively collected in a deidentified registry. Predictors of longer hospitalization were assessed by univariate and multiple regression analysis. One-day LOS was accomplished in 71.9% primary and 58.3% revisional LRYGBs. Median LOS was 1 day for primary and revisional LRYGB and mean lengths of stay were 1.34 and 1.63 days, respectively. ""Excellent"" or ""very good"" satisfaction ratings were reported regarding the FTP education provided (95.3%), surgeon's accessibility (98.3%), and hospital care (86.5%). Only 0.34% of patients who had a 1-day LOS indicated that they would benefit from an additional in-hospital stay. In multivariate analysis, independent predictors of longer hospitalization included prolonged operative time, hemoglobin reduction, reoperation for primary LRYGB, and operative time for revisional LRYGB. A 1-day FTP can be successfully implemented in the majority of primary and revisional LRYGB patients regardless of preoperative patient characteristics without increasing the risk of 30-day morbidity, mortality, reoperations, readmissions, emergency department or outpatient fluid visits, or reducing patient satisfaction.",10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2016.03.005,,,,881
365,Laparoscopic-Percutaneous Combined Gastrostomy: Initial Experience and Description of a Technique.,"Background: Gastrostomy is a widely used procedure that aims to obtain access to the stomach. Its purpose may be feeding or gastric decompression. Currently, the most common techniques are endoscopic and radiologic. Sometimes, these accesses are not available due to technical or patient-specific factors. In these cases, laparoscopic and percutaneous approaches combined could be an option. The aim of this study was to describe a laparoscopic-percutaneous combined gastrostomy procedure, feasibility, and complications. Materials and Methods: Retrospective descriptive observational study. All patients underwent laparoscopic-percutaneous combined gastrostomy required for feeding or decompressive gastrostomy. We analyzed variables: demographics, surgical indication, operation time, hospitalization stay, success, and morbidity/mortality associated to the procedure. Results: A total of nâ€‰=â€‰17 patients were recruited (58.8% women and 41.2% men), with mean age of 53. Regarding the indications of laparoscopic-percutaneous combined gastrostomy, 47% were due to upper gastrointestinal/head and neck tumor, 29.4% stomach location in a retrocostal position, 17.7% colonic interposition, and 5.9% acute gastric dilation of remnant after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The mean time of the procedure was 25 minutes, and mean hospitalization stay was 1.2 days. The success of the procedure was 100%. No complications and mortality associated with the procedure were reported. Conclusion: Laparoscopic-percutaneous combined gastrostomy is fast, feasible, safe, and cost effective. It is an option in patients where it is not possible to perform standard minimally invasive approaches.",10.1089/lap.2021.0431,,,,882
1320,Changes in dermal histomorphology following surgical weight loss versus diet-induced weight loss in the morbidly obese patient.,"Patients with postgastric bypass and diet-induced weight loss present to the plastic surgeon for various body contouring procedures. Gross differences in skin dermal elasticity may exist between these populations; however, studies evaluating histologic differences are lacking. This prospective study aims to evaluate histomorphologic differences in morbidly obese patients following surgical versus diet-induced (nonsurgical) weight loss. Further, we aim to elicit if postoperative complications are correlated with the mechanism of weight loss and potential histomorphologic differences. Defined infraumbilical skin specimens were collected during abdominal contouring procedures following weight loss achieved through surgical or nonsurgical means. Specimens were stained for elastic fiber content and morphology, collagen deposition, and inflammation. All sections underwent evaluation for quality and quantity of elastic fibers, collagen architecture, and presence of inflammation in the context of age-matched controls. Histomorphological results were compared between the 2 groups and subanalyzed according to clinical variables and postbody contouring wound complications. Between July 2008 and December 2010, 30 consecutive patients with significant weight loss (17 surgical, 13 nonsurgical) underwent a panniculectomy (n = 15), abdominoplasty (n = 13), and lower body lift (n = 2), with an average age of 48.3 Â± 11.10 years and a body mass index of 39.23 Â± 13.65 kg/m. Demographic and clinical variables were not statistically significant between the 2 groups. Blinded histologic evaluation revealed a trend toward normal elastic fiber appearance (P = 0.255), increased wound complications (P = 0.546), and mild inflammation (P = 0.462) in the surgical group. Analysis of dermal histomorphology correlating with wound complications was not statistically significant at follow-up (4.76 Â± 5.55 months). Interestingly, there was a persistent inflammatory component in both groups when compared with age-matched controls. Although the differences in histomorphology between the surgical and nonsurgical weight loss groups did not reach statistical significance, the results demonstrated an existence of weight loss-induced histomorphological skin changes that may impact future studies. The study did not demonstrate a relationship between dermal histomorphology and postoperative wound complications, suggesting that aberrant healing in body contouring procedures involves a multifactorial process.",10.1097/SAP.0b013e31823aefc3,,,,883
1090,Feasibility and impact of an evidence-based program for gastric bypass surgery.,"Health care in the United States is expensive and quality is variable. The aim of this study was to investigate whether our integrated health system, composed of academic hospitals, a practice plan, and a managed care payer, could reliably implement an evidence-based program for gastric bypass surgery. A secondary aim was to evaluate the impact of the program on clinical outcomes. A standardized program for delivery of clinical best-practice elements for patients undergoing initial open or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was implemented in 2008. Best-practice elements were embedded into the workflow. The best-practice elements were refined after reviewing failures observed during the early implementation period. The study period was divided into 3 groups: group Î± = year preceding program implementation (control), group Î² = first year of implementation (unreliable), and group Î© = 2nd to 4th years of implementation (reliable). Outcomes data were collected for all patients who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between May 2008 and April 2012 and were compared with a control group from the preceding year using multiple logistic regression analysis. Two thousand and sixty-one patients were studied, with no significant demographic differences between study groups. Best-practice elements delivery was 40% in group Î², but was >90% for group Î© (p < 0.001). Length of stay for group Î± was 3.5 days and improved to 2.2 days (p < 0.001) for group Î©. Complications and readmission rates improved considerably with reliable delivery of best-practice elements. Standardization of evidence-based care delivery for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was feasible and reliable delivery of this pathway improved clinical outcomes.",10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2015.01.040,,,,884
74,Perioperative Dexmedetomidine Infusion Improves Perioperative Care of Bariatric-Metabolic Surgery: A Single Center Experience with Meta-Analysis.,"This study aims to determine the effects of perioperative dexmedetomidine infusion (PDI) on Asian patients undergoing bariatric-metabolic surgery (BMS), focusing on the need for pain medications and management of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and to investigate the association with these variables, including patients' characteristics and BMS data. A retrospective review of prospectively collected data was conducted in an Asian weight management center from August 2016 to October 2021. A total of 147 native patients with severe obesity were enrolled. All patients were informed of the full support of perioperative pain medications for BMS. The pain numeric rating scale scores, events of PONV, needs for pain medications, and the associated patients' characteristics were analyzed. A p-value ofâ€‰<â€‰0.05 was considered statistically significant. Furthermore, to verify the effects of perioperative usage of dexmedetomidine for BMS, a systematic review with meta-analysis of currently available randomized control trials was performed. Among the 147 enrolled patients, 107 underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and 40 underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. PDI has been used as an adjunct multimodal analgesia for BMS in our institution since June 2017 (group D; nâ€‰=â€‰114). In comparison with those not administered with perioperative dexmedetomidine (group C; nâ€‰=â€‰33), lower pain numeric rating scale scores (2.52â€‰Â±â€‰2.46 vs. 4.27â€‰Â±â€‰2.95, pâ€‰=â€‰0.007) in the postanesthesia care unit, fewer PONV (32.46% vs. 51.52%; pâ€‰=â€‰0.046), and infrequent needs of additional pain medications (19.47% vs. 45.45%; pâ€‰=â€‰0.003) were observed in group D. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that type II diabetes mellitus was correlated with the decreased need of pain medications other than PDI (pâ€‰=â€‰0.035). Moreover, dexmedetomidine seemed to have a better analgesic effect for patients with longer surgical time based on our meta-analysis. Based on our limited experience, PDI could be a practical solution to alleviate pain and PONV in Asian patients undergoing BMS. Moreover, it might reduce the need for rescue painkillers with better postoperative pain management for patients with type II diabetes mellitus or longer surgical time.",10.1007/s11695-023-07036-w,,,,885
956,GLP-1 and GLP-2 Levels are Correlated with Satiety Regulation After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: Results of an Exploratory Prospective Study.,"Changes in satiety regulation are known to play a pivotal role in the weight loss effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and the mechanisms by which these changes occur are not entirely known. There are previous reports of the influence of GLP-1 to cause enhancement of satiation, but in regard to GLP-2, it remains unclear. This study aimed to determine whether there is a correlation between the levels of GLP-1 and GLP-2 and satiety regulation following RYGB. An exploratory prospective cohort study was made which enrolled 11 individuals who underwent RYGB and were followed-up for 12Â months. GLP-1 and GLP-2 levels were determined before and after surgery and correlated with visual analogue scale scores for satiety. GLP-2 AUC after standard meal tolerance test (MTT) was significantly higher following surgery (945.3â€‰Â±â€‰449.1 versus 1787.9â€‰Â±â€‰602.7; pâ€‰=â€‰0.0037). Postoperatively, GLP-1 AUC presented a significant negative correlation with the mean score obtained in the first question of the visual analogue scale (""how hungry do you feel?"") (pâ€‰=â€‰0.008); GLP-2 AUC presented a significant positive correlation with the mean score of the third (""how full do you feel?"") question, and a significant positive correlation with the mean score achieved in the fourth question (""how much do you think you can eat?""), (pâ€‰=â€‰0.005 and pâ€‰=â€‰0.042, respectively). GLP-1 and GLP-2 were significantly correlated with satiety assessment within this sample. Further research is necessary to confirm these findings.",10.1007/s11695-016-2345-3,,,,886
202,THE INTESTINAL MICROBIOME IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING BARIATRIC SURGERY: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW.,"Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is frequently found in cases of obesity and related metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. The composition of the microbiota in diabetics is similar to that of obese people, thereby causing increased energy uptake efficiency in the large intestine of obese people, maintenance of a systemic inflammatory state, and increased insulin resistance. Bariatric surgery seems to entail an improvement in gut dysbiosis, leading to an increased diversity of the gut microbiota. This study aimed to present a literature review on obesity-associated gut dysbiosis and its status post-bariatric surgery. A systematic review of primary studies was conducted in PubMed, SciELO, BIREME, LILACS, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Scopus databases using DeCS (Health Science Descriptors) with the terms ""obesity,"" ""intestinal dysbiosis,"" ""bariatric surgery,"" and ""microbiota."" We analyzed 28 articles that had clinical studies or literature reviews as their main characteristics, of which 82% (n=23) corresponded to retrospective studies. The sample size of the studies ranged from 9 to 257 participants and/or fecal samples. The epidemiological profile showed a higher prevalence of obesity in females, ranging from 24.4 to 35.1%, with a mean age of around 25-40 years. There was a variation regarding the type of bariatric surgery, migrating between the Roux-en-Y bypass, adjustable gastric banding, and vertical gastrectomy. Of the 28 studies, 6 of them evaluated the gut microbiota of obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery and their relationship with type 2 diabetes mellitus/glucose metabolism/insulin resistance. The intestinal microbiota is an important influencer in the regulation of the digestive tract, and obese individuals with comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and metabolic syndrome) present important alterations, with an unbalance normal state, generating dysbiosis and the proliferation of bacterial species that favor the appearance of new diseases. Patients who undergo bariatric surgery present an improvement in the intestinal microbiota imbalance as well as reversibility of their comorbidities, increasing their life expectancy.",10.1590/0102-672020220002e1707,,,,887
233,A comparison of opioid-containing anesthesia versus opioid-free anesthesia using the CortÃ­nez-SepÃºlveda model on differential cytokine responses in obese patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery: a randomized controlled trial.,"Opioid anesthetic agents can modulate the impaired immune response in obese patients through mechanisms that involve the expression and release of cytokines. For this reason, anesthetic care for obese patients remains controversial. Therefore, the aim of the study was to compare the effect of opioid-containing anesthesia (OCA) vs opioid-free anesthesia (OFA) using the CortÃ­nez-SepÃºlveda model on IL-6, IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± serum levels before and after surgery in obese patients undergoing bypass surgery. This randomized cross-sectional study conducted among 40 unrelated obese adults was performed in the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara ""Dr. Juan I. Menchaca"". Before undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, patients were randomly assigned to two anesthesia groups: OCA (nâ€‰=â€‰20) or OFA (nâ€‰=â€‰20). Fentanyl was the opioid used in the OCA group. The CortÃ­nez-SepÃºlveda pharmacokinetic model was used to characterize the disposition of intravenous propofol for the target-controlled infusion technique in obese patients. Body mass was determined to the nearest 0.05â€‰kg using a balance scale (Seca 703; Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Blood samples were taken before and immediately after surgery and cytokine concentrations were determined by ELISA. Pain was assessed using a numerical pain rating scale. Adverse effects were collected within the first 24â€‰h after surgery. A total of 6 men and 34 women were included (37.9â€‰Â±â€‰10.6â€‰years). Pre-surgery IL-6 and TNF-Î± serum levels were not detected in study subjects. However, IL-1Î² levels significantly decreased after surgery (49.58â€‰pg/mL (18.50-112.20)-before surgery vs 13â€‰pg/mL (5.43-22)-after surgery, pÂ =â€‰0.019). IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in subjects who received OCA (with fentanyl) compared to subjects with OFA (224.5â€‰pg/mL (186.3-262.8) vs 99.5â€‰pg/mL (60.8-138.2), respectively, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001; adjusted by age, gender, and BMI). In addition, the use of opioids confers an increased risk for higher IL-6 levels in obese patients (ORâ€‰=â€‰2.95, 95% CI: 1.2-7.2, pâ€‰=â€‰0.010). A linear regression model showed that the operative time (in hours) of bypass surgery and anesthetic technique were positively correlated with IL-6 levels. Anesthesia with opioids correlated positively with IL-6 serum levels in obese patients undergoing bypass surgery. This finding could have clinical relevance when an appropriate anesthetic management plan is selected for bariatric surgical patients. The study was retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov Identification Number: NCT04854252, date 22/04/2021.",10.1186/s12871-022-01838-8,,,,888
25,The Role of Dietary Intake in the Weight Loss Outcomes of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"The relationship between postoperative dietary intake and weight loss after bariatric surgery remains unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published between January 2000 and May 2023, reporting weight loss outcomes, and dietary intake before and after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. A total of 42 studies were included. There was no detectable difference in dietary intake between the two procedures. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass induced an average decrease in energy intake of 886 kcal/day at 12-month post-surgery; however, there was no correlation between daily energy intake and weight loss. These findings show a substantial reduction of energy intake in the first year after bariatric surgery but do not support a link between lower energy intake and greater weight loss.",10.1007/s11695-024-07183-8,,,,889
1168,Effect of closure of the mesenteric defect during laparoscopic gastric bypass and prevention of internal hernia.,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the benefits and disadvantages of closing the mesenteric defects during gastric bypass to avoid internal herniation (IH). The study is performed as a single-centre, randomised, controlled, blinded trial. Patients are randomly assigned to either conventional laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) without closing the mesenteric defects (n = 250) or RYGB with closing of the defects with hernia clips (n = 250). Follow-up is conducted at six months, one year, two years and five years after RYGB. The primary endpoint is the incidence of IH. This study will be the first Danish, randomised, controlled study comparing conventional LRYGB with and without closure of the mesenteric defects. The results will contribute to evidence-based recommendations for the prevention of IH. not relevant. The study was registered with the Danish Data Protection Agency (SN-10-2012) and The Central Denmark Regional Committees on Biomedical Research Ethics (1-01-83-0209-12, SJ-284). The study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01595230.",,,,,890
950,Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in patients with post-bariatric surgery complications.,"Obesity is a worldwide health problem. Bariatric surgery (BS) is becoming one of the most commonly used methods for fighting obesity and its associated comorbidities. However, current BS techniques can be associated with early or late complications that may require nutritional support. The aim of this retrospective observational study was to determine the indications and outcomes for patients on Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) due to post-bariatric surgery complications. A specific questionnaire was designed by the ESPEN HAN/CIF working group and submitted to HPN centers. This questionnaire included: patient demographics, type of surgery, BMI before surgery and at start of HPN, indications for HPN including technical and nutritional complications (early within 2 months after surgery or late), outcome, PN regimen, and HPN complications. Patients were retrospectively included from January 2008 to June 2014. Eighteen HPN centers responded to the survey. A total of 2880 HPN patients were treated during the study period, 77 of whom had BS (65 females; mean age 51Â Â±Â 7 years); gastric bypass was performed in 69% of the patients; mean BMI was 44.4 before surgery and 23.2Â at the start of HPN. Indications for HPN were early complications in 17 cases and late complications in 60 cases. Early complications were mostly anastomotic leakage/fistula; late complications were hypoalbuminemia, and vitamin and trace element deficiencies. Out of 77 patients, 16 needed a surgical re-intervention, 29 were weaned off HPN, and 6 died (no HPN-related deaths). During the HPN period, 58% of the patients were re-hospitalized and central venous complications were observed in 41%. Diabetes mellitus was described in 17/77 patients. HPN was supportive in 60 patients and exclusive in 17 patients (mean caloric intake: 23Â Â±Â 6Â kcal/k BW/day and 1.2Â g/kBW/day). Only 7/77 patients resumed their professional activities on HPN. This is the largest observational multicenter study describing the use of HPN in patients with post-BS complications. Severe hypoalbuminemia is a major late complication. Rates of re-hospitalization and CVC infection were high. HPN may be a ""bridge therapy"" before surgical revision after BS. The high mortality rate reflects the complexity of these cases.",10.1016/j.clnu.2016.08.025,,,,891
1181,"Rapid gastric and intestinal transit is a major determinant of changes in blood glucose, intestinal hormones, glucose absorption and postprandial symptoms after gastric bypass.","To evaluate the effect of modulating pouch emptying (PE) and SI transit of glucose after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on blood glucose, incretin hormones, glucose absorption and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Ten RYGB patients were studied twice in random order, receiving either a 150 ml glucose drink (200 kcal) or the same solution infused into the proximal Roux-limb at 4 kcal/min. Data were compared with 10 healthy volunteers who received a 4 kcal/min duodenal infusion. PE, cecal arrival time (CAT), blood glucose, plasma 3-O-methylglucose (3-OMG), insulin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and GI symptoms were measured. In RYGB subjects, the glucose drink emptied very rapidly (PE t50â€‰=â€‰3â€‰Â±â€‰1 min) and intestinal glucose infusion was associated with higher blood glucose and plasma 3-OMG, but lower plasma GLP-1, GIP, insulin, and GI symptoms than oral glucose (all Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and comparable to volunteers. In RYGB subjects, CAT correlated inversely with peak GLP-1 (râ€‰=â€‰-0.73, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01), and plasma 3-OMG correlated tightly blood glucose (râ€‰=â€‰0.94, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). After RYGB, reducing intestinal glucose delivery to 4 kcal/min is associated with higher blood glucose, greater glucose absorption, lower incretin responses, and less GI symptoms, supporting rapid transit contribution to the exaggerated incretin responses and ""dumping symptoms"".",10.1002/oby.20791,,,,892
1421,Surgical removal of omental fat does not improve insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular risk factors in obese adults.,"Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is an important risk factor for the metabolic complications associated with obesity. Therefore, a reduction in VAT is considered an important target of obesity therapy. We evaluated whether reducing VAT mass by surgical removal of the omentum improves insulin sensitivity and metabolic function in obese patients. We conducted a 12-month randomized controlled trial to determine whether reducing VAT by omentectomy in 22 obese subjects increased their improvement following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery in hepatic and skeletal muscle sensitivity to insulin study 1. Improvement was assessed by using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique. We also performed a 3-month, longitudinal, single-arm study to determine whether laparoscopic omentectomy alone, in 7 obese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), improved insulin sensitivity study 2. Improvement was assessed by using the Frequently Sampled Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test. The greater omentum, which weighed 0.82 kg (95% confidence interval: 0.67-0.97), was removed from subjects who had omentectomy in both studies. In study 1, there was an approximate 2-fold increase in muscle insulin sensitivity (relative increase in glucose disposal during insulin infusion) and a 4-fold increase in hepatic insulin sensitivity 12 months after RYGB alone and RYGB plus omentectomy, compared with baseline values (P<.001). There were no significant differences between groups (P>.87) or group x time interactions (P>.36). In study 2, surgery had no effect on insulin sensitivity (P=.844) or use of diabetes medications. These results demonstrate that decreasing VAT through omentectomy, alone or in combination with RYGB surgery, does not improve metabolic function in obese patients.",10.1053/j.gastro.2010.04.056,,,,893
1193,"Anemia, iron and vitamin B12 deficiencies after sleeve gastrectomy compared to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a meta-analysis.","The effective treatment of postoperative anemia and nutritional deficiencies is critical for the successful management of bariatric patients. However, the evidence for nutritional risk or support of bariatric patients remains scarce. The aims of this study were to assess current evidence of the association between 2 methods of bariatric surgery, sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and postoperative anemia and nutritional deficiencies. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for English-language studies using a list of keywords. Reference lists from relevant review articles were also searched. In the authors' meta-analysis, they included studies with a duration of>12 months, those comparing SG with RYGB, and those with available outcome data for postoperative anemia and iron and vitamin B12 deficiencies. Of 36 potentially relevant studies, 9 met the inclusion criteria. Data were combined by means of a fixed-effects model or random-effects model. Compared with the SG group, the odds ratio for postoperative vitamin B12 deficiency in the RYGB group was 3.55 (95% confidence interval, 1.26-10.01; P<.001). In the subgroup analysis, studies in which prophylactic iron or vitamin B12 was administered lost significance in the odds ratio for postoperative vitamin B12 deficiency. The authors' findings suggest that SG is more beneficial than RYGB with regard to postoperative vitamin B12 deficiency risk, whereas the 2 methods are comparable with regard to the risk of postoperative anemia and iron deficiency. Postoperative prophylactic iron and B12 supplementation, in addition to general multivitamin and mineral supplementation, is recommended based on the comparable deficiency risk of the 2 methods as indicated by subgroup analysis.",10.1016/j.soard.2013.12.005,,,,894
206,"The Impact of Bariatric Surgery on Cardiac Structure, and Systolic and Diastolic Function in Patients with Obesity: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.","The purpose of this study was to provide pooled data from all studies on the impact of bariatric surgery on cardiac structure, and systolic and diastolic function evaluated by either echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance. PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus databases were searched. Almost all of cardiac left-side structural indices improved significantly after bariatric surgery. However, right-side structural indices did not change significantly. Left ventricular ejection fraction and most of the diastolic function indices improved significantly after the bariatric surgery. The subgroup analysis showed that the left ventricular mass index decreased more in long-term follow-up (â‰¥â€‰12Â months). In addition, subgroup analysis of studies based on surgery type did not reveal any difference in outcomes between gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy groups.",10.1007/s11695-022-06396-z,,,,895
1381,Copper and zinc serum levels after derivative bariatric surgery: differences between Roux-en-Y Gastric bypass and biliopancreatic diversion.,"There are limited data on the prevalence of copper and zinc deficiency in the long term after bariatric surgery. We analysed copper and zinc serum levels in a cohort of 141 patients, 52 who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and 89 biliopancreatic diversion (BPD), with a follow-up of 5Â years. Mean copper level was significantly lower in the BPD group (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001 vs. RYGB). Forty-five (50.6%) BPD patients had, at least once, a low copper level, and half of them, 27 (30.3%) patients, had repeatedly low levels. In this group, serum copper level correlated positively with total leukocyte and granulocyte count (râ€‰=â€‰0.14, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.002, and râ€‰=â€‰0.17, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001, respectively). However, no patient had clinical evidence of haematological or neurological disorders. Only two RYGB patients (3.8%) had copper deficiency. Mean zinc level was also significantly lower in the BPD group (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). All but one BPD patient had hypozincaemia at least once, and the percentage of patients with hypozincaemia ranged from 44.9% to 74.2%. In RYGB patients, zinc deficiency peaked at 48 and 60Â months (15.4% and 21.2%, respectively). The zinc level was determined by the alimentary limb length in this group, but the common channel length had no influence on copper and zinc levels in the BPD group. Hypocupremia, and especially hypozincaemia, are frequent findings in BPD patients, but rarely found in patients who underwent RYGB, particularly short RYGB. Our data also suggest that a long-standing and severe hypocupremia is required to develop neurological and haematological disorders after bariatric surgery.",10.1007/s11695-011-0389-y,,,,896
338,Comparison of gastrojejunostomy to endoscopic stenting for gastric outlet obstruction: An updated Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"This study aimed to determine the optimal intervention modality for malignant GOO by comparing clinical outcomes after Gastrojejunostomy and endoscopic stenting. Two authors independently searched Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for articles before February 2021 to compare the clinical outcomes of GOO patients undergoing GJ or ES. This meta-analysis included 31 articles with 2444 GOO patients. Although the GJ group outperformed the ES group in technical success (OR,3.79; PÂ =Â 0.003), clinical success was not significantly different between the two groups (OR,1.25; PÂ =Â 0.50). The GJ group had a longer hospitalization, lower re-obstruction and lower reintervention. Moreover, GJ had a better survival than ES in the gastric cancer group (HR, 0.33; PÂ =Â 0.009). However, no significant statistical difference was observed in the pancreatic cancer group (HR, 0.55; PÂ =Â 0.159). Both GJ and ES are safe and effective intervention modalities for malignant GOO. GJ had significantly improved survival in gastric cancer patients with GOO, while no significant difference was observed between the two groups in pancreatic cancer patients with GOO.",10.1016/j.amjsurg.2021.10.038,,,,897
922,Influence of dietary protein and its amino acid composition on postoperative outcomes after gastric bypass surgery: a systematic review.,"Bariatric surgery is an effective method to reduce morbid obesity. Nutritional counseling is essential to achieve maximal treatment success and to avoid long-term complications. Increased dietary protein intake may improve various postoperative results. The aim of this systematic review is to examine the relationship between intake of dietary protein or supplementation with amino acids and postoperative outcomes after gastric bypass surgery. A systematic literature search was conducted in 4 electronic databases: Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, and Scopus. The initial search retrieved 7333 hits, which included 2390 duplicates. Tweny-three studies with varying study designs, interventions, and outcomes were included. Studies did not provide convincing evidence of a beneficial effect on any postoperative outcome. The study of the influence of protein and its amino acid composition represents an important developing domain of knowledge and warrants further attention considering the popularity of bariatric surgery. Future studies should include a clear description of the quantity and composition of proteins and amino acids in the diet or supplement.",10.1093/nutrit/nuw042,,,,898
364,Management of Laryngotracheal Stenosis in Obesity. Is This Another Co-morbidity that Can Be Improved with Weight Loss Following Bariatric Surgery?,"Bariatric surgery improves several obesity-related comorbidities. Laryngotracheal stenosis is a rare condition that is usually managed with repeated endoscopic airway interventions and reconstructive airway surgery. The outcome of these definitive operations is worse in individuals with obesity. There are no studies investigating the effect of weight loss following bariatric surgery in the management of laryngotracheal stenosis. In an observational study, consecutive patients with a BMI over 35Â kg/m2 and laryngotracheal stenosis were prospectively recruited to a bariatric and airway stenosis database in two tertiary care centres. Patients were treated with laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy and control subjects were managed conservatively. A total of eleven patients with an initial body mass index of 43Â kg/m2 (37-45) were enrolled to this study. Six patients underwent bariatric surgery and five subjects were treated conservatively. After 12Â months, the total weight loss of patients undergoing bariatric surgery was 19.4% (14-24%) whilst 2.3% (1-3%) in the control group. The annual number of endoscopic airway interventions following bariatric surgery reduced (pâ€‰=â€‰0.002). Higher weight loss in patients led to less frequent interventions compared to control subjects (pâ€‰=â€‰0.004). Patients undergoing laryngotracheal reconstruction following bariatric surgery needed less endoscopic intervention, an annual average of 1.9 interventions before vs 0.5 intervention after. Conservatively managed control subjects required more frequent endoscopic intervention, 1.8 before vs 3.4 after airway reconstruction. Bariatric surgery reduced the number of endoscopic airway interventions and enabled patients to undergo successful definitive airway reconstructive surgery.",10.1007/s11695-021-05647-9,,,,899
478,"Comparison of surgical outcomes between isolated pancreaticojejunostomy, isolated gastrojejunostomy, and conventional pancreaticojejunostomy after pancreaticoduodenectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","We aimed to compare the safety and effectiveness of the following procedures after pancreaticoduodenectomy: isolated pancreaticojejunostomy, isolated gastrojejunostomy, and conventional pancreaticojejunostomy. We performed a systematic search of the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov until 1 January 2020. Pooled odds ratios (OR) or weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using STATA 12.0 statistical software. Thirteen studies involving 1942 patients were included in this study. Pooled analysis showed that reoperation rates following isolated pancreaticojejunostomy were lower reoperation than with conventional pancreaticojejunostomy (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.36, 95% CI: 0.15-0.86, pâ€‰=â€‰0.02, respectively), and that isolated pancreaticojejunostomy required longer operation time vs conventional pancreaticojejunostomy (WMDâ€‰=â€‰43.61, 95% CI: 21.64-65.58, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.00). Regarding postoperative pancreatic fistula, clinically-relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, clinically-relevant delayed gastric emptying, bile leakage, hemorrhage, reoperation, length of postoperative hospital stay, major complications, overall complications, and mortality, we found no significant differences for either isolated pancreaticojejunostomy versus conventional pancreaticojejunostomy or isolated gastrojejunostomy versus conventional pancreaticojejunostomy. This study showed that isolated pancreaticojejunostomy was associated with a lower reoperation rate, but required longer operation time vs conventional pancreaticojejunostomy. Considering the limitations, high-quality randomized controlled trials are required.",10.1186/s12876-020-01415-8,,,,900
1364,Prospective and randomized comparison of two techniques of staple line reinforcement during open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: oversewing and bioabsorbable SeamguardÂ®.,"Surgical staple line dehiscence usually leads to severe complications. Several techniques and materials have been used to reinforce this stapling and thus reduce the related complications. The objective was to compare safety of two types of anastomotic reinforcement in open gastric bypass. A prospective, randomized study comparing an extraluminal suture, fibrin glue, and a nonpermanent buttressing material, SeamguardÂ®, for staple line reinforcement. Fibrin glue was excluded from the study and analysis after two leaks, requiring surgical reintervention, antibiotic therapy, and prolonged patient hospitalization. Twenty patients were assigned to the suture and Seamguard reinforcement groups. The groups were similar in terms of preoperative characteristics. No staple line dehiscence occurred in the two groups, whereas two cases of dehiscence occurred in the fibrin glue group. No mortality occurred and surgical time was statistically similar for both techniques. Seamguard made the surgery more expensive. In our service, staple line reinforcement in open bariatric surgery with oversewing or Seamguard was considered to be safe. Seamguard application was considered to be easier than oversewing, but more expensive.",10.1089/lap.2010.0469,,,,901
1622,Evaluation of core temperature during laparoscopic and open gastric bypass.,"Intraoperative hypothermia is a common event during open and laparoscopic abdominal surgery. The aim of this study was to compare changes in core temperature between laparoscopic and open gastric bypass (GBP). 101 patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 40-60 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to open (n = 50) or laparoscopic (n = 51) GBP. Anesthetic technique was similar for both groups. An external warming blanket and passive airway humidification were used intraoperatively. Core temperature was recorded at preanesthesia, at baseline (after induction) and at 30-min intervals; intra-abdominal temperature was additionally measured at 30-min intervals in a subset of 30 laparoscopic GBP patients. The number of patients who developed intraoperative and postoperative hypothermia (< 36 degrees C) was recorded. Length of operation for both groups and the amount of CO2 gas delivered during laparoscopic operations were also recorded. There was no significant difference between groups with respect to age, gender, mean BMI, and amount of intravenous fluid administered. After induction of anesthesia, core temperature significantly decreased in both groups; 36% of patients in the open group and 37% of patients in the laparoscopic group developed hypothermia. This percentage increased to 46% in the open group and 41% in the laparoscopic group during the operation, and then decreased to 6% in the open group and 8% in the laparoscopic group in the recovery-room. Core temperature increased during the operative procedure to reach 36.5 +/- 0.6 degrees C in the open group and 36.3 +/- 0.5 degrees C in the laparoscopic group at 2.5 hours after surgical incision. Intra-abdominal temperature during laparoscopic GBP was significantly lower than core temperature at all measurement points (p < 0.05). Operative time was longer in the laparoscopic group than in the open group (232 +/- 43 vs 201 +/- 38 min, p < 0.01). Mean volume of gas delivered during laparoscopic GBP was 650 +/- 220 liters. Perioperative hypothermia was a common event during both laparoscopic and open GBP. Despite a longer operative time, laparoscopic GBP did not increase the rate of intraoperative hypothermia when efforts were made to minimize intraoperative heat loss.",10.1381/09608920160557039,,,,902
43,Changes in Nutritional Outcomes After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Bariatric surgery (BS) is the most effective treatment for severe obesity and it has beneficial effects on glycemic control and metabolism outcomes. However, the effects of BS on nutritional outcomes are controversial. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the changes in several nutritional outcomes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). A comprehensive search was performed using the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, WanFang and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure. The following outcomes were evaluated: vitamin A, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], calcium, phosphorus, parathormone (PTH), iron, ferritin, vitamin B12, folate, and zinc. The pooled outcomes were expressed as standard mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random effects model. Fifty-six studies including 5645 individuals with obesity met the inclusion criteria. Serum 25(OH)D (SMDâ€‰=â€‰0.78, 95%CI 0.38 to 1.20, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), phosphorus (SMDâ€‰=â€‰0.48, 95%CI 0.22 to 0.74, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), PTH (SMDâ€‰=â€‰0.35, 95%CI 0.11 to 0.59, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.005), vitamin B12 (SMDâ€‰=â€‰1.11, 95%CI 0.41 to 1.80, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.002), and folate (SMDâ€‰=â€‰1.53, 95%CI 0.77 to 2.28, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) significantly increased after RYGB compared with the baseline. Serum ferritin (SMDâ€‰=â€‰â€‰-â€‰1.67, 95%CIâ€‰-â€‰2.57 toâ€‰-â€‰0.77, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), vitamin A (SMDâ€‰=â€‰â€‰-â€‰0.64, 95%CIâ€‰-â€‰0.99 toâ€‰-â€‰0.29, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and plasma zinc (SMDâ€‰=â€‰â€‰-â€‰0.58, 95%CIâ€‰-â€‰1.09 toâ€‰-â€‰0.06, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.027) significantly decreased after RYGB.

886,Does rating the operation videos with a checklist score improve the effect of E-learning for bariatric surgical training? Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"Laparoscopic training has become an important part of surgical education. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the most common bariatric procedure performed. Surgeons must be well trained prior to operating on a patient. Multimodality training is vital for bariatric surgery. E-learning with videos is a standard approach for training. The present study investigates whether scoring the operation videos with performance checklists improves learning effects and transfer to a simulated operation. This is a monocentric, two-arm, randomized controlled trial. The trainees are medical students from the University of Heidelberg in their clinical years with no prior laparoscopic experience. After a laparoscopic basic virtual reality (VR) training, 80 students are randomized into one of two arms in a 1:1 ratio to the checklist group (group A) and control group without a checklist (group B). After all students are given an introduction of the training center, VR trainer and laparoscopic instruments, they start with E-learning while watching explanations and videos of RYGB. Only group A will perform ratings with a modified Bariatric Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (BOSATS) scale checklist for all videos watched. Group B watches the same videos without rating. Both groups will then perform an RYGB in the VR trainer as a primary endpoint and small bowel suturing as an additional test in the box trainer for evaluation. This study aims to assess if E-learning and rating bariatric surgical videos with a modified BOSATS checklist will improve the learning curve for medical students in an RYGB VR performance. This study may help in future laparoscopic and bariatric training courses. German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00010493 . Registered on 20 May 2016.",10.1186/s13063-017-1886-7,,,,904
775,Trans-Gastric ERCP After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Trans-oral endoscopic access to the pancreaticobiliary system is challenging after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Trans-gastric ERCP (TG-ERCP) has emerged as a viable option to manage patients with symptomatic post-RYBG choledocolithiasis. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the outcomes of TG-ERCP to better define the risk-benefit ratio of this procedure and to guide clinical decision-making. A literature search was conducted to identify all reports on ERCP after RYGB. Pubmed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were thoroughly consulted matching the terms ""ERCP"" AND ""gastric bypass."" Pooled prevalence of ERCP success rate, ERCP-related morbidity, post-procedural infectious complications, and overall morbidity were calculated using Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation and DerSimonian-Laird estimator in random effect meta-analysis. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated using I2-index and Cochrane Q test. Meta-regression was used to address the effect of potential confounders. Thirteen papers published between 2009 and 2017 matched the inclusion criteria. Eight hundred fifty patients undergoing 931 procedures were included. The most common clinical indications for TG-ERCP were biliary (90%) and pancreatic (10%). The majority of patients underwent an initial laparoscopic approach (90%). Same-day ERCP was successfully achieved in 703 cases (75.5%). Pooled prevalence of ERCP success rate, ERCP-related morbidity, post-procedural infectious complications, and overall morbidity were 99% (95% CIâ€‰=â€‰98-100%), 3.1% (95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.0-5.8%), 3.4% (95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.7-5.5%), and 14.2% (95% CIâ€‰=â€‰8.5-20.8%), respectively. TG-ERCP is a safe and effective therapeutic option in patients with symptomatic post-RYGB choledocolithiasis.",10.1007/s11695-018-3258-0,,,,905
288,Evaluation and Management of Patients Referred for Post-Bariatric Surgery Hypoglycemia at a Tertiary Care Center.,"Following bariatric surgery, patients can develop non-specific symptoms self-described as hypoglycemia. However, confirming hypoglycemia can be technically challenging, and therefore, these individuals are frequently treated empirically. This study aimed to describe what diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic interventions patients referred for post-bariatric surgery hypoglycemia undergo. Retrospective observational cohort study of patients with a history of bariatric surgery was evaluated for post-bariatric surgery hypoglycemia in a tertiary referral center from 2008 to 2017. We collected demographic and bariatric surgery information, clinical presentation of symptoms referred to as hypoglycemia, laboratory and imaging studies performed to evaluate these symptoms, and symptom management and outcomes. A total of 60/2450 (2.4%) patients who underwent bariatric surgery were evaluated in the Department of Endocrinology for hypoglycemia-related symptoms. The majority were middle-aged women without type 2 diabetes who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Thirty-nine patients (65%) completed a biochemical assessment for hypoglycemia episodes. Six (10%) had confirmed hypoglycemia by Whipple's triad, and four (6.7%) met the criteria for post-bariatric surgery hypoglycemia based on clinical and biochemical criteria. All patients were recommended dietary modification as the initial line of treatment, and this intervention resulted in most patients reporting at least some improvement in their symptoms. Eight patients (13%) were prescribed pharmacotherapy, and two patients required additional interventions for symptom control. In our experience, evaluation for hypoglycemia-related symptoms after bariatric surgery was rare. Hypoglycemia was confirmed in the minority of patients. Even without establishing a diagnosis of hypoglycemia, dietary changes were a helpful strategy for symptom management for most patients.",10.1007/s11695-022-05986-1,,,,906
1420,Acute effect of roux-en-y gastric bypass on whole-body insulin sensitivity: a study with the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp.,"Insulin resistance ameliorates after bariatric surgery, yet there is still a need for data on the acute effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) on insulin sensitivity. The objective of the study was to describe the acute effect of RYGBP on insulin sensitivity, measured by both the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR). Evaluations were conducted before and 1 month after RYGBP at State University of Campinas (SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil). Patients included 19 premenopausal women with metabolic syndrome aged 35.3 (6.7) yr, body mass index 45.50 (3.74) kg/m2 [mean (sd)]. Six had mild type 2 diabetes, seven impaired glucose tolerance, and six normal glucose tolerance. The volunteers underwent RYGBP either alone or combined with omentectomy. Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, HOMA-IR, nonesterified fatty acids, leptin, ultrasensitive C-reactive protein, adiponectin, and IL-6 were assessed at baseline and 4.5 (0.9) wk postoperatively. Fasting glucose decreased [99.2 (13.1) to 83.6 (8.1) mg/dl, P<0.01] along with a reduction in fasting insulin [30.4 (17.0) to 11.4 (6.3) mU/liter, P<0.01]. M value did not improve postoperatively [25.82 (6.30) to 22.02 (6.05) micromol/kgFFM.min] despite of a decrease in body weight [114.8 (14.5) to 102.3 (14.5) kg, P<0.001]. This finding was discordant to the observation of an improvement in HOMA-IR [3.85 (2.10) to 1.42 (0.76), P<0.01]. Nonesterified fatty acids increased. Leptin and C-reactive protein decreased. IL-6 and adiponectin remained unchanged. A month after RYGBP, fasting glucose metabolism improves independent of a change in peripheral insulin sensitivity.",10.1210/jc.2010-0085,,,,907
556,Effects of Bariatric Surgery on HDL Cholesterol.,"Low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) are independent predictive factors of coronary heart disease. Bariatric surgery increases HDLc concentration, but the chronology and predictors of this improvement in HDLc levels are not well-established. The aim of the present study was to analyse the changes over time in HDLc concentrations after bariatric surgery and to determine the predictors of their increase. This was a retrospective, observational study. The medical records of patients who had undergone bariatric surgery at a tertiary care hospital between January 2007 and March 2015 were reviewed. Patients who underwent revisional surgery or were treated with fibrates were excluded from the analysis. A total of 185 patients were included in the study. Follow-up rates were as follows: 87% (year 2) and 28% (year 5). At postoperative month 3, HDLc levels decreased significantly versus baseline (-â€‰11.1%; pâ€‰=â€‰0.000), at which point they began to rise, reaching their maximum level 2Â years after bariatric surgery (26.2% increase from baseline; pâ€‰=â€‰0.000). The increase in HDLc concentration 2Â years after surgery correlated with the preoperative HDLc level (râ€‰=â€‰-â€‰0.292, pâ€‰=â€‰0.001), and it was greater in patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy versus gastric bypass (0.36â€‰Â±â€‰0.4 vs. 0.18â€‰Â±â€‰0.4Â mmol/L, respectively; pâ€‰=â€‰0.018). Bariatric surgery has a beneficial effect on HDLc levels. The maximum increase in postoperative HDLc concentrations is observed 2Â years after surgery. Preoperative HDLc and the type of surgery are both significant predictors of the maximum increase in HDLc levels.",10.1007/s11695-020-04385-8,,,,908
103,Change in Mineral Status After Bariatric Surgery: a Meta-analysis.,"The risk of protein and vitamin deficiencies after bariatric surgery has been well studied, but the change in mineral status has not gotten enough attention. This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis regarding the change in mineral levels after bariatric surgery and the prevalence of postoperative mineral deficiency, with subgroup analyses of different surgical procedures, study regions, and follow-up time. CENTRAL, PubMed, and EMBASE were searched for related articles. Meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, and sensitivity analysis were performed if necessary. A total of 107 articles with 47,432 patients were included. The most severe mineral deficiency after bariatric surgery was iron (20.1%), followed by zinc (18.3%), copper (14.4%), chlorine (12.2%), phosphorus (7.5%), and calcium (7.4%). Serum concentrations of potassium, sodium, selenium, manganese, and molybdenum showed no significant change before and after surgery. Subgroup analyses revealed that SG had fewer deficiencies in serum iron, calcium, zinc, magnesium, phosphorus, copper, and selenium than RYGB. OAGB showed a higher incidence of serum iron and zinc deficiencies than RYGB. Studies conducted in different regions also found various mineral statuses after surgery. Studies with follow-up â‰¥ 5 years had a lower prevalence of zinc, copper, and selenium deficiencies than follow-up < 5 years. A high deficiency rate of serum iron, zinc, copper, chlorine, phosphorus, and calcium was seen after bariatric surgery. The difference in surgical procedures, study regions, and follow-up time may affect postoperative mineral status; more targeted mineral supplement programs are needed considering these influencing factors.",10.1007/s11695-023-06888-6,,,,909
558,The Relationship Between Bariatric Surgery and Diet Quality: a Systematic Review.,"Bariatric surgery is currently the most effective treatment for morbid obesity. These procedures change the gastrointestinal system with the aim of reducing dietary intake. Improving diet quality is essential in maintaining nutritional health and achieving long-term benefits from the surgery. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the relationship between bariatric surgery and diet quality at least 1Â year after surgery. A systematic search of five databases was conducted. Studies were included that reported diet quality, eating pattern, or quality of eating in adult patients who had undergone laparoscopic-adjusted gastric banding (LAGB), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) procedures. Data was extracted to determine the relationship between having had bariatric surgery and subsequent diet quality. A total of 34 study articles (described in 36 articles) met the inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were observational in nature and showed a reduction in energy intake following surgery, as well as inadequate intakes of micronutrients and protein, and an excessive intake of fats. There was evidence of nutrient imbalances, suboptimal compliance with multivitamin and mineral supplementation, and limited follow-up of patients. The current evidence base suggests that despite being effective in reducing energy intake, bariatric surgery can result in unbalanced diets, inadequate micronutrient and protein intakes, and excessive intakes of fats. In combination with suboptimal adherence to multivitamin and mineral supplementation, this may contribute to nutritional deficiencies and weight regain. There is a need for high-quality nutrition studies, to identify optimal dietary compositions following bariatric surgery.",10.1007/s11695-020-04392-9,,,,910
198,Comparable Effects of Sleeve Gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass on Basal Fuel Metabolism and Insulin Sensitivity in Individuals with Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes.,"Bariatric surgery improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), but there is a lack of data comparing the underlying metabolic mechanisms after the 2 most common surgical procedures Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). This study was designed to assess and compare the effects of RYGB and SG on fuel metabolism in the basal state and insulin sensitivity during a two-step euglycemic glucose clamp. 16 obese individuals with T2D undergoing either RYGB (n = 9) or SG (n = 7) were investigated before and 2 months after surgery, and 8 healthy individuals without obesity and T2D served as controls. All underwent a 2â€‰h basal study followed by a 5â€‰h 2-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp at insulin infusion rates of 0.5 and 1.0â€‰mU/kg LBM/min. RYGB and SG induced comparable 15% weight losses, normalized HbA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and decreased energy expenditure. In parallel, we recorded similar increments (about 100%) in overall insulin sensitivity (M-value) and glucose disposal and similar decrements (about 50%) in endogenous glucose production and FFA levels during the clamp; likewise, basal glucose and insulin concentrations decreased proportionally. Our data suggest that RYGB and SG improve basal fuel metabolism and two-step insulin sensitivity in the liver, muscle, and fat and seem equally favourable when investigated 2 months after surgery. This trial is registered with NCT02713555.",10.1155/2022/5476454,,,,911
870,Gross Olfaction Before and After Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass.,"Obesity leads to olfaction alterations, and this can further impact food choices, appetite, and nutritional status. Bariatric procedures induce weight loss and change in taste and smell perception, but more information is needed, especially using objective olfaction tests. A prospective study was conducted during 6Â months, with candidates to laparoscopic gastric bypass at a single institution. A preoperative nasofibroscopy and gross smell identification test (The Pocket Smell Test Â®) were performed in those meeting the inclusion criteria. After 6Â months, a new test was performed, and the primary objective was to determine if there was an improvement in the olfaction score. Weight loss and comorbidities improvement were also analyzed. From the 30 patients with morbid obesity enrolled, 21 met the inclusion criteria and ENT evaluation. At baseline, 42.8% of patients scored 3 points, 53.3% scored 2 points, and 4.7% scored 1 point. After 6Â months, there was a -81.1% of change. Seventeen patients scored 3 points (pÂ =Â 0.002 vs initial) and two scored 2 points (pÂ =Â 0.006 vs initial). There were no patients with less than 2 points. Weight and comorbidities had a significant improvement as well. Laparoscopic gastric bypass improves the olfaction scores of the Pocket Smell Test in morbidly obese patients 6Â months after their procedure. More complex tests can be used in candidates to bariatric surgery if low scores are detected initially. Other causes of olfaction dysfunctions should be determined if there is no improvement after weight loss.",10.1007/s11695-017-2733-3,,,,912
875,Comparative effectiveness of sleeve gastrectomy versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for weight loss and safety outcomes in older adults.,"Most bariatric studies in older adult patients have focused on older operations with limited follow-up and equivocal results. To compare weight loss and safety in patients agesâ‰¥65 years undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). Nine different bariatric surgery centers with 23 surgeons serving over 30,000 bariatric patients. Participants wereâ‰¥65 years who had a SG or LRYGB between January 1, 2010, and March 15, 2015. Outcomes measured were change in weight up to 4 years after surgery; 30-, 90-, and 365-day mortality; and early (â‰¤30 d) and late (31-365 d) complication rates. To control for nonrandom assignment, SG and LRYGB cases were propensity matched at the time of surgery for gender, race/ethnicity, procedure year, body mass index, presence of diabetes and/or hypertension, and overall co-morbidity burden. There were 177 LRYGB and 252 SG patients (n = 429). Patients were female (70%), 67 years old (range 65 to 79), non-Hispanic white (64%), and had a body mass index of 42.6Â±5.4 kg/m2. The year 4 follow-up rate was 75% (n = 322). LRYGB patients lost significantly more weight than SG after a median 4 years of follow-up (P<.001), mortality was similar, and LRYGB had higher overall complication rates (30.5%) than SG (15.4%). Elderly patients lost significantly more weight with LRYGB compared with SG. Further studies will be necessary to determine if the long-term effects of greater weight loss warrant the increased risk involved with LRYGB.",10.1016/j.soard.2017.03.011,,,,913
736,Impact of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy on fetal growth and relationship with maternal nutritional status.,"There is a lack of evidence on whether sleeve gastrectomy (SG), which induces fewer nutritional deficiencies than Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), also affects fetal growth (FG). To compare neonatal outcomes after RYGB and SG and to assess the impact of maternal nutritional alterations on FG after both procedures. University Hospital, France. Women with singleton pregnancies who had at least 1 nutritional evaluation in our institution between 2004 and 2017 were included. FG was assessed with birth weight (BW) and BW-Z score (adjusted for sex and term), and maternal nutritional deficiencies were defined according to standard and pregnancy-specific norms. During the study period 123 pregnancies were included, 77 after RYGB and 46 after SG. Weight loss was higher after RYGB than after SG (45.6 Â± 12.4 versus 39.5 Â± 13.7 kg, Pâ€¯=â€¯.02), but mean weight before pregnancy and weight gain during pregnancy were similar. Mean BW (3026 Â± 677 versus 3162 Â± 712 g), mean BW Z-score and incidence of small for gestational age (24% versus 19%) were not significantly different after RYGB and SG. Mean number of nutritional deficiencies during the second trimester was similar (2.2 Â± 1.5 versus 2.1 Â± 1.2 with specific norms), but the affected parameters differed between procedures. Urinary urea (Râ€¯=â€¯.285, Pâ€¯=â€¯.04) was positively correlated to BW Z-score after both procedures. In contrast, serum iron parameters were negatively associated to BW Z-score. FG restriction occurs after both SG and RYGB. FG after bariatric surgery is positively associated with protein supply and negatively correlated with maternal iron status.",10.1016/j.soard.2018.07.014,,,,914
991,Internal Herniation in Pregnancy After Gastric Bypass: A Systematic Review.,"To assess maternal and fetal outcomes of pregnancies complicated by internal herniation after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Articles were identified through searches in online databases (ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and Google Scholar) from January 1980 to March 2015 for the following terms: [gastric bypass OR bariatric surgery] AND [pregnancy] AND [complication OR herniation OR obstruction]. Reference lists of relevant articles were hand-searched. Additionally, we searched our own hospital's obstetric database for cases of internal herniation after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Only articles in English and studies in humans were selected. Cases of internal herniation outside of pregnancy or internal herniation without a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were excluded. Of 384 articles identified by the initial search, 22 were retained for further analysis. All retrieved articles were case reports or case series. There were no interventional studies. We retrieved 47 cases from the literature and five cases from our own database. The mean gestational age at diagnosis was 28.4Â±7.3 weeks. All women presented with abdominal pain. Nausea and vomiting were present in only 65%. Ultrasonography and laboratory results are usually noninformative, and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis in only 75% of cases. Nine of 52 women (17.3%) required bowel resections. There were two maternal deaths and three perinatal deaths, all in women treated later than 48 hours after onset of the symptoms. Internal herniation complicating pregnancy after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass typically presents with subtle signs in the third trimester of pregnancy. Timely recognition and early surgical intervention are associated with a reduced risk of bowel ischemia and maternal and fetal adverse outcomes.",10.1097/AOG.0000000000001429,,,,915
301,TECHNIQUE OF EXPOSURE OF THE ESOPHAGOGASTRIC JUNCTION OBTAINED BY THE FLEXIBLE LIVER RETRACTOR IN BARIATRIC SURGERY: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL.,"In the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass technique, classic laparoscopic surgical retractors are usually rigid, require an additional incision for its installation, or must be handled by an assistant during the surgical procedure, involving a risk of liver injury. The aim of this study was to evaluate and validate a technique of the esophagogastric junction exposure obtained by the flexible liver retractor in bariatric surgery, comparing its efficacy with the retractor classically used for this purpose. This study was performed as a randomized, open, prospective, controlled, and comparative design in patients with medical indications of bariatric surgery. The subjects were distributed in the classic (control) and flexible (test) retractor groups. A total of 100 patients (n=50 control group, n=50 test group) were included. No statistically significant difference was observed in the mean duration of surgery. Regarding visibility, 100% of the patients in the flexible retractor group demonstrated an optimal visibility level, although without statistical significance concerning the classic retractor group (94%). Invariably, carrying a trocar was necessary when using the classic retractor. The flexible liver retractor is safe, effective, ergonomic, and inexpensive. Furthermore, it presented a satisfactory aesthetic profile, and the use of specific instruments, new adaptation curve, and training for its handling were not required.",10.1590/0102-672020210002e1631,,,,916
222,Risk of non-hormonal cancer after bariatric surgery: meta-analysis of retrospective observational studies.,"Obesity is associated with an increased incidence of at least 13 types of cancer. Although bariatric surgery has been associated with a reduced risk of hormonal cancers, data for non-hormonal cancers are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of bariatric surgery on the incidence of non-hormonal cancers. Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for articles between 1984 and 2018, following the PRISMA system. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effect model with subgroup analysis by procedure and cancer type. From 2526 studies screened, 15 were included. There were a total of 18 583 477 patients, 947 787 in the bariatric group and 17 635 690 in the control group. In comparison to the non-surgical group, the bariatric group had a lower incidence of cancer (OR .65 (95 per cent c.i. 0.53 to 0.80); P < 0.002). In the subgroup analysis, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy were associated with decreased risk of developing cancer, while no difference was observed with adjustable gastric banding. When evaluated by cancer type, liver (OR 0.417 (95 per cent c.i. 0.323 to 0.538)), colorectal (OR 0.64 (95 per cent c.i. 0.49 to 0.84)), kidney and urinary tract cancer (OR 0.77 (95 per cent c.i. 0.72 to 0.83)), oesophageal (OR 0.60 (95 per cent c.i. 0.43 to 0.85)), and lung cancer (OR 0.796 (95 per cent c.i. 0.45 to 0.80)) also presented a lower cancer incidence in the bariatric group. Bariatric surgery is related to an almost 50 per cent reduction in the risk of non-hormonal cancers.",10.1093/bjs/znac343,,,,917
860,Use of prescribed opioids before and after bariatric surgery: prospective evidence from a U.S. multicenter cohort study.,"Limited evidence suggests bariatric surgery may not reduce opioid analgesic use, despite improvements in pain. To determine if use of prescribed opioid analgesics changes in the short and long term after bariatric surgery and to identify factors associated with continued and postsurgery initiated use. Ten U.S. hospitals. The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 is an observational cohort study. Assessments were conducted presurgery, 6 months postsurgery, and annually postsurgery for up to 7 years until January 2015. Opioid use was defined as self-reported daily, weekly, or ""as needed"" use of a prescribed medication classified as an opioid analgesic. Of 2258 participants with baseline data, 2218 completed follow-up assessment(s) (78.7% were female, median body mass index: 46; 70.6% underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass). Prevalence of opioid use decreased after surgery from 14.7% (95% CI: 13.3-16.2) at baseline to 12.9% (95% CI: 11.5-14.4) at month 6 but then increased to 20.3%, above baseline levels, as time progressed (95% CI: 18.2-22.5) at year 7. Among participants without baseline opioid use (n = 1892), opioid use prevalence increased from 5.8% (95% CI: 4.7-6.9) at month 6 to 14.2% (95% CI: 12.2-16.3) at year 7. Public versus private health insurance, more pain presurgery, undergoing subsequent surgeries, worsening or less improvement in pain, and starting or continuing nonopioid analgesics postsurgery were significantly associated with higher risk of postsurgery initiated opioid use. After bariatric surgery, prevalence of prescribed opioid analgesic use initially decreased but then increased to surpass baseline prevalence, suggesting the need for alternative methods of pain management in this population.",10.1016/j.soard.2017.04.003,,,,918
196,Change in Adipokines and Gastrointestinal Hormones After Bariatric Surgery: a Meta-analysis.,"The study aimed to perform a meta-analysis about the change in adipokines and gastrointestinal hormones after bariatric surgery in patients with obesity. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, and PubMed for related articles and used Review Manager 5.4 for data aggregation. Sensitivity and subgroup analysis were also conducted when feasible. As a result, 95 articles involving 6232 patients were included in the meta-analysis. After bariatric surgery, the levels of leptin, ghrelin, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP), tumor necrosis, factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), and interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) reduced, while adiponectin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and peptide YY (PYY) levels increased significantly. Subgroup analysis indicated that there was a more significant reduction in leptin level with a longer follow-up time. OAGB had a greater effect on increasing adiponectin level compared with other procedures. SG procedure would bring about reduced ghrelin, while BPD resulted in increased ghrelin. Meta-regression analysis found that publication year, study design, number of patients, preoperative age, preoperative BMI, and quality assessment score were not significantly related to change in leptin, adiponectin, and ghrelin levels. Bariatric surgery was associated with a significant decrease in leptin, ghrelin, CRP, IL-6, Hs-CRP, TNF-Î±, and IL-1Î², as well as increase in adiponectin, GLP-1, and PYY levels.",10.1007/s11695-022-06444-8,,,,919
598,Short-term effects of Vertical sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on glucose homeostasis.,"The objective of this study was to compare the biochemical changes related to glucose tolerance and lipid metabolism in non-diabetic patients shortly after vertical sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Non-diabetic women and men with morbid obesity were studied the day before and six days after SG (Nâ€‰=â€‰15) or RYGB (Nâ€‰=â€‰16). Patients completed an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; 75â€‰g glucose) at both visits. SG and RYGB similarlyÂ improved fasting glucose homeostasis six days after surgery, with reduced glucose and insulin concentrations. The OGTT revealed differences between the two surgery groups that were not evident from the fasting serum concentrations. Postprandial (120 min)Â glucose andÂ insulinÂ concentrations were lower after RYGB but not after SG, whereas concentrations ofÂ glucagon-like peptide-1, peptide YY, glucagonÂ and non-esterified fatty acids were elevated after both SG and RYGB. Fasting triacylglycerol concentration did not change after surgery, but concentrations of high density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein cholesterols were reduced in both surgery groups, with no differences between the groups. To conclude, RYGB induced a more pronounced improvement in postprandial glucose homeostasis relative to SG, possibly due to improved insulin sensitivity rather than augmented insulin concentration.",10.1038/s41598-019-51347-x,,,,920
850,All-Cause and Specific-Cause Mortality Risk After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in Patients With and Without Diabetes.,"This study assessed all-cause and specific-cause mortality after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and in matched control subjects, stratified by diabetes status. RYGB patients were matched by age, BMI, sex, and diabetes status at time of surgery to nonsurgical control subjects using data from the electronic health record. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression were used to assess differences in all-cause and specific-cause mortality between RYGB patients and control subjects with and without diabetes. Of the 3,242 eligible RYGB patients enrolled from January 2004 to December 2015, control subjects were identified for 2,428 (n = 625 with diabetes and n = 1,803 without diabetes). Median postoperative follow-up was 5.8 years for patients with diabetes and 6.7 years for patients without diabetes. All-cause mortality was reduced in RYGB patients compared with control subjects only for those with diabetes at the time of surgery (adjusted hazard ratio 0.44; P < 0.0001). Mortality was not significantly improved in RYGB patients without diabetes compared with control subjects without diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio 0.84; P = 0.37). Deaths from cardiovascular diseases (P = 0.011), respiratory conditions (P = 0.017), and diabetes P = 0.011) were more frequent in control subjects with diabetes than in RYGB patients with diabetes. RYGB patients without diabetes were less likely to die of cancer (P = 0.0038) and respiratory diseases (P = 0.046) than control subjects without diabetes but were at higher risk of death from external causes (P = 0.012), including intentional self-harm (P = 0.025), than control subjects without diabetes. All-cause mortality benefits of RYGB are driven predominantly by patients with diabetes at the time of surgery. RYGB patients with diabetes were less likely to die of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and respiratory conditions than their counterparts without RYGB.",10.2337/dc17-0519,,,,921
743,Reconstruction options following pancreaticoduodenectomy after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a systematic review.,"Obesity is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer which may be treated with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and represents an increasing morbidity. Post-RYGB anatomy poses considerable challenges for reconstruction after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), a growing problem encountered by surgeons. We characterize specific strategies used for post-PD reconstruction in the RYGB patient. PubMed search was performed using MeSH terms ""Gastric Bypass"" and ""Pancreaticoduodenectomy"" between 2000 and 2018. Articles reporting cases of pancreaticoduodenectomy in post-RYGB patients were included and systematically reviewed for this study. Three case reports and five case series (25 patients) addressed PD after RYGB; we report one additional case. The typical post-gastric bypass PD patient is a woman in the sixth decade of life, presenting most commonly with pain (69.2%) and/or jaundice (53.8%), median 5Â years after RYGB. Five post-PD reconstructive options are reported. Among these, the gastric remnant was resected in 18 cases (69.2%), with reconstruction of biliopancreatic drainage most commonly achieved using the distal jejunal segment of the pre-existing biliopancreatic limb (73.1%). Similarly, in the eight cases where the gastric remnant was spared (30.8%), drainage was most commonly performed using the distal jejunal segment of the biliopancreatic limb (50%). Among the 17 cases reporting follow-up data, median was 27Â months. Reconstruction options after PD in the post-RYGB patient focus on resection or preservation gastric remnant, as well as creation of new biliopancreatic limb. Insufficient data exists to make recommendations regarding the optimal reconstruction option, yet surgeons must prepare for the possible clinical challenge. PD reconstruction post-RYGB requires evaluation through prospective studies.",10.1186/s12957-018-1467-6,,,,922
967,Monitoring of Liver Function Tests after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: An Examination of Evidence Base.,"There is no consensus on the monitoring of liver function tests after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Since the main objective of such monitoring would be to diagnose early those who will eventually develop liver failure after RYGB, we performed a systematic review on this topic. An extensive search of literature revealed only 10 such cases in 6 published articles. It would hence appear that liver failure is a rare problem after RYGB. Routine lifelong monitoring of liver function tests is therefore unnecessary for otherwise asymptomatic individuals. Such monitoring should hence be reserved for high-risk groups, such as patients with liver cirrhosis, those undergoing extended limb/distal RYGB, patients with new illnesses, those abusing alcohol, those on hepatotoxic drugs and those presenting with a surgical complication.",10.1007/s11695-016-2280-3,,,,923
486,"Effects of Probiotics Supplementation on Gastrointestinal Symptoms and SIBO after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: a Prospective, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.","Bariatric surgery may cause undesirable gastrointestinal symptoms due to anatomical, functional and intestinal microbiota changes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of probiotic supplementation on gastrointestinal symptoms and small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in patients after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The patients were randomized into Control Group (CG) (nâ€‰=â€‰39) and Probiotic Group (PG) (nâ€‰=â€‰34). The PG received tablets containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobaterium lactis (5Â billion CFU/strain) for 90Â days, and the CG received tablets with starch. Both the Gastric Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) questionnaire and 3-day food record were answered before surgery (T0) and after 45Â days (T1) and 90Â days of surgery (T2). At T0 and T2, hydrogen breath test was used to verify the presence of SIBO. The prevalence of SIBO was similar among times, and the mean score of GSRS responses did not differ between groups at any time. However, PG patients reported less bloating compared to CG, more abdominal pain at T1 (which reduced at T2), more episodes of soft stools and nausea and less hunger pain after surgery, with no reports of urgent episodes to evacuate, even though they consumed more fat than the CG. The supplementation of L. acidophilus and B. lactis is effective in reducing bloating, but without influencing the development of SIBO in the early postoperative period.",10.1007/s11695-020-04900-x,,,,924
109,Diabetes Remission After LRYGBP With and Without Fundus Resection: a Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Glycemic control, after metabolic surgery, is achieved in two stages, initially with neuroendocrine alterations and in the long-term with sustainable weight loss. The resection of the gastric fundus, as the major site of ghrelin production, is probably related with optimized glucose regulation. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether the modification of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP) with fundus resection offers superior glycemic control, compared to typical LRYGBP. Participants were 24 patients with body mass index (BMI) â‰¥40kg/m2 and type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), who were randomly assigned to undergo LRYGBP and LRYGBP with fundus resection (LRYGBP+FR). Gastrointestinal (GI) hormones [ghrelin, glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide-YY (PYY)] and glycemic parameters (glucose, insulin, HbA1c, C-peptide, insulinogenic index, HOMA-IR) were measured preoperatively, at 6 and 12 months during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Ninety-five percent of patients showed complete remission of T2DM after 12 months. LRYGBP+FR was not related with improved glycemic control, compared to LRYGBP. Ghrelin levels were not significantly reduced at 6 and 12 months after LRYGBP+FR. GLP-1 and PYY levels were remarkably increased postprandially in both groups at 6 and 12 months postoperatively (p<0.01). Patients who underwent LRYGBP+FR achieved a significantly lower BMI at 12 months in comparison to LRYGBP (p<0.05). Fundus resection is not associated with improved glycemic regulation, compared to typical LRYGBP and the significant decrease in BMI after LRYGBP+FR has to be further confirmed with longer follow-up.",10.1007/s11695-023-06857-z,,,,925
448,First-Phase Insulin and Amylin after Bariatric Surgery: A Prospective Randomized Trial on Patients with Insulin Resistance or Diabetes after Gastric Bypass or Sleeve Gastrectomy.,"Most patients with severe obesity show glucose intolerance. Early after sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or gastric bypass (LRYGB), a marked amelioration in glycemic control occurs. The underlying mechanism is not yet clear. To determine whether the improvement in glycemic control on the level of endocrine pancreatic function is due to an increased first-phase insulin secretion comparing LRYGB to LSG. University of Basel Hospital and St. Clara Research Ltd., Basel, Switzerland. Sixteen morbidly obese patients with severe obesity and different degrees of insulin resistance were randomized to LSG or LRYGB, and islet cell functions were tested by intravenous glucose and intravenous arginine administration before and 4 weeks after surgery. Fasting insulin and glucose levels and homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance were significantly lower in both groups after surgery compared to baseline, while no change was seen in fasting C-peptide, amylin, and glucagon. After intravenous glucose stimulation, no statistically significant pre- to postoperative change in area under the curve (AUC 0-60 min) was seen for insulin, glucagon, amylin, and C-peptide. No statistically significant pre- to postoperative change in incremental AUC for first-phase insulin release (AUC 0-10 min), second-phase insulin secretion (AUC 10-60 min), and insulin/glucose ratio could be shown in either group. Arginine-stimulated insulin and glucagon release showed no pre- to postoperative change. Intravenous glucose and arginine administrations show no pre- to postoperative changes of insulin release, amylin, glucagon, or C-peptide concentrations, and no differences between LRYGB and LSG were found. The postoperative improvement in glycemic control is not caused by changes in endocrine pancreatic hormone secretion.",10.1159/000511928,,,,926
34,FEASIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF GENERAL ANESTHESIA WITH OPIOIDS VERSUS OPIOID-FREE ANESTHESIA PLUS TRANSVERSUS ABDOMINIS PLANE BLOCK ON POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES AFTER MINI GASTRIC BYPASS SURGERY.,"Opioid-free anesthesia (OFA) is increasingly used at present in surgical practice by many hospitals as a new and very promising anesthesiologic regimen. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of standard general anesthesia with opioids with so-called opioid-free anesthesia on postoperative outcomes of patients who underwent gastric bypass surgery. This randomized, single-blind clinical study enrolled 103 patients scheduled for elective gastric bypass surgery. They were assigned randomly to receive either general anesthesia without opioids plus transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block (Group 1: 53 patients) or general anesthesia with opioids (Group 2: 50 patients). 21.4% (22/103) males and 78.6% (81/103) females were operated. The average age of patients was 40.9 and the average BMI - 48.4. Patients from both groups (patients who received general anesthesia + TAP and patients who received general anesthesia with opioids) were assessed for postoperative pain at rest using a 0-to-10 visual analog pain scale (0 = no pain, 5 = moderate pain, and 10 = the most severe pain possible). In group 1 - 34% (18/53) of patients did not receive any medication against pain and 66% (35/53) received Dexalgin Inject 25mg/ml 2 ml. There was no need in opioids. In group 2 - 10% (5/50) of patients did not receive any medication against pain, 38% (19/50) received Dexalgin Inject 25mg/ml 2 ml and 52% (26/50) received Dexalgin Inject 25mg/ml 2 ml + Promedol 20mg/ml 1ml. Type of anesthesia is a significant predictor of postoperative outcomes, such as pain intensity, extubation time, intensive care stay, and hospital length of stay in patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery. Patients, who received (OFA) plus (TAP) block had better pain control than those who received general anesthesia with opioids. No opioids were used in group 1. In addition, the duration of hospital stay in group 1 was shorter, and the average cost for postoperative hospital stay was 2.39 times lower than in group 2. OFA can be used as a reliable and effective anesthesiologic technique in patients scheduled for bariatric surgery.",,,,,927
1051,The link between obesity and vitamin D in bariatric patients with omega-loop gastric bypass surgery - a vitamin D supplementation trial to compare the efficacy of postoperative cholecalciferol loading (LOAD): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"Beyond its classical role in calcium homoeostasis and bone metabolism, vitamin D deficiency has been found to be associated with several diseases, including diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and even obesity itself. Importantly, there are limited data on therapeutic strategies for vitamin D deficiency in bariatric patients, and the procedure-specific guidelines may not be sufficient. To improve long-term outcomes, nutritional screening and appropriate supplementation to prevent nutrient deficiencies are urgently needed. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine effects and safety of a forced dosing regimen of vitamin D versus conventional dose supplementation on vitamin D levels and other parameters in bariatric patients. The study includes loading plus repeat dosing compared with repeated administration of vitamin D without a loading dose, according to guidelines, in a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Up to a triple oral loading dose is given on day 1, then 2 and 4Â weeks after surgery (100,000 IU dose each time), followed by an oral maintenance dose (3420Â IU/day). The control group (nâ€‰=â€‰25) will receive placebo, followed by administration of a standard dose (3420Â IU/day). We hypothesize that a significant increase in vitamin D levels will occur in patients in the treatment group (nâ€‰=â€‰25) by 24Â weeks after surgery. Further measurements are aimed at evaluating changes in inflammation, bone turnover, insulin resistance, blood pressure, liver, mental health, and gut microbiota of patients undergoing omega-loop gastric bypass surgery. Furthermore, possible associations between concentrations of vitamin D, the involved enzymes, or vitamin D receptor in adipose and/or liver tissues will be determined. To our knowledge, this trial is the first of its kind with this type of vitamin D supplementation in bariatric patients. Its major strength is the design and implementation of evaluation of influencing factors such as liver function, bone health, inflammation, insulin resistance, blood pressure, symptoms of depression, or microbiota. This alternative vitamin D dosing regimen has the potential to be a safe, fast, evidence-based treatment of vitamin D deficiency in bariatric patients. Owing to the increasing number of bariatric patients, it is also of interest to elucidate the link between obesity and vitamin D. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02092376 .

560,"Analgesic effect of postoperative laparoscopic-guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block, associated with preoperative port-site infiltration, within an enhanced recovery after surgery protocol in one-anastomosis gastric bypass: a randomized clinical trial.","The use of ultrasonography to assist needle placement during transverse abdominal plane (TAP) technique has provided direct visualization of surround anatomical musculature and facial planes. However, the increased girth in patients undergoing bariatric surgery is challenging to visualize via ultrasonography which may lead to poor postoperative analgesia. The aim of the study is to investigate whether the addition of postoperative laparoscopic-guided TAP block as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen within the ERAS protocol compared to no block provides better postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing one-anastomosis gastric bypass surgery. A prospective clinical trial was performed. Patients were randomized into two groups: patients undergoing postoperative laparoscopic-guided TAP (TAP-lap) and patients not receiving TAP-lap (Control). Multimodal analgesia included preoperative port-site infiltration with Bupivacaine 0.25% in both groups and systemic Acetaminophen. Pain quantification as measured by visual analogic scale (VAS) was assessed at 6 and 24Â h after surgery, and 24-h postoperative opioid consumption. One hundred and forty patients were included, 70 in each group. The mean operation time was 78.5â€‰Â±â€‰14.4Â min in TAP-lap and 75.9â€‰Â±â€‰15.6Â min in Control (NS). The mean postoperative pain, as measured by VAS, 6Â h after surgery was 23.1â€‰Â±â€‰11.3Â mm in TAP-lap and 41.8â€‰Â±â€‰16.2Â mm in Control (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001). 24Â h after surgery was 16.6â€‰Â±â€‰11.4Â mm in TAP-lap and 35.4â€‰Â±â€‰12.7Â mm in Control (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001). Morphine rescues were necessary in 14.2% in Control and 2.8% in TAP-lap (pâ€‰=â€‰0.035). Laparoscopic-guided TAP block as part of a multimodal analgesia regimen can reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption, without increasing operative time.",10.1007/s00464-019-07341-5,,,,929
438,Safety of metabolic and bariatric surgery in obese patients with liver cirrhosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"With the pandemic of obesity and the growing experience in metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS), the number of patients with obesity and liver cirrhosis undergoing MBS is increasing. To analyze the morbidity and mortality following MBS in patients with obesity and liver cirrhosis. Systematic review and meta-analysis. The published literature was systematically reviewed, in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, for studies reporting outcomes of MBS among patients with liver cirrhosis. The predetermined endpoints were the overall complication after MBS, intraoperative complications, liver-related complications after MBS, all-cause 90-day mortality after MBS, and liver-related mortality post-MBS. The pooled weighted proportions for each of the endpoints was calculated using random effect meta-analysis. A total of 18 studies, including 471 patients with obesity and liver cirrhosis undergoing MBS, qualified for the final quantitative analysis. The mean age and mean body mass index (BMI) of the pooled patient cohort were 50.2 years and 47.2 kg/m2. The pooled weighted proportions of the overall post-MBS complications, intraoperative complications, liver-related complications, overall 90-day mortality, and liver failure related mortality post MBS were 22.14% (CI95%: 15.43%-29.55%), .08% (CI95%: 0%-1.02%), 4.62% (CI95%: 1.27%-9.30%), 0% (CI95%: 0%-.44%), .08% (CI95%: 0%-1.03%), respectively. Significantly lower postoperative complications were noted with sleeve gastrectomy (10.08% [95%CI: 5.14%-16%]) compared with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (31.53% [95%CI: 18.62%-45.68%]; (P = .02). We found an overall low postoperative surgical and liver-related mortality post MBS among patients with obesity and liver cirrhosis. The overall postoperative complications and liver-related complications were higher among patients with liver cirrhosis than in noncirrhotic patients. Sleeve gastrectomy showed lower postoperative complications compared with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.",10.1016/j.soard.2020.11.004,,,,930
1412,Contraceptive use among women with a history of bariatric surgery: a systematic review.,"Weight loss after bariatric surgery often improves fertility but can pose substantial risks to maternal and fetal outcomes. Women who have undergone a bariatric surgical procedure are currently advised to delay conception for up to 2 years. We conducted a systematic review of the literature, from database (PubMed) inception through February 2009, to evaluate evidence on the safety and effectiveness of contraceptive use among women with a history of bariatric surgery. From 29 articles, five met review inclusion criteria. One prospective, noncomparative study reported 2 pregnancies among 9 (22%) oral contraceptive (OC) users following biliopancreatic diversion, and one descriptive study reported no pregnancies among an unidentified number of women taking OCs following laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Of two pharmacokinetic studies, one found lower plasma levels of norethisterone and levonorgestrel among women having had a jejunoileal bypass, as compared to nonoperated, normal-weight controls. The other study found no difference in plasma levels of D-norgestrel between women having a jejunoileal bypass of either 1:3 or 3:1 ratio between the length of jejunum and ileum left in continuity, but women with a 1:3 ratio had significantly higher plasma levels of D-norgestrel than extremely obese controls not operated upon. Evidence regarding OC effectiveness following a bariatric surgical procedure is quite limited, although no substantial decrease in effectiveness was identified from available studies. Evidence on failure rates for other contraceptive methods and evidence on safety for all contraceptive methods was not identified.",10.1016/j.contraception.2010.02.008,,,,931
1276,Health related quality of life after gastric bypass or intensive lifestyle intervention: a controlled clinical study.,"There is little robust evidence relating to changes in health related quality of life (HRQL) in morbidly obese patients following a multidisciplinary non-surgical weight loss program or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB). The aim of the present study was to describe and compare changes in five dimensions of HRQL in morbidly obese subjects. In addition, we wanted to assess the clinical relevance of the changes in HRQL between and within these two groups after one year. We hypothesized that RYGB would be associated with larger improvements in HRQL than a part residential intensive lifestyle-intervention program (ILI) with morbidly obese subjects. A total of 139 morbidly obese patients chose treatment with RYGB (n=76) or ILI (n=63). The ILI comprised four stays (seven weeks) at a specialized rehabilitation center over one year. The daily schedule was divided between physical activity, psychosocially-oriented interventions, and motivational approaches. No special diet or weight-loss drugs were prescribed. The participants completed three HRQL-questionnaires before treatment and 1 year thereafter. Both linear regression and ANCOVA were used to analyze differences between weight loss and treatment for five dimensions of HRQL (physical, mental, emotional, symptoms and symptom distress) controlling for baseline HRQL, age, age of onset of obesity, BMI, and physical activity. Clinical relevance was assessed by effect size (ES) where ES<.49 was considered small, between .50-.79 as moderate, and ES>.80 as large. The adjusted between group mean difference (95% CI) was 8.6 (4.6,12.6) points (ES=.83) for the physical dimension, 5.4 (1.5-9.3) points (ES=.50) for the mental dimension, 25.2 (15.0-35.4) points (ES=1.06) for the emotional dimension, 8.7 (1.8-15.4) points (ES=.37) for the measured symptom distress, and 2.5 for (.6,4.5) fewer symptoms (ES=.56), all in favor of RYGB. Within-group changes in HRQOL in the RYGB group were large for all dimensions of HRQL. Within the ILI group, changes in the emotional dimension, symptom reduction and symptom distress were moderate. Linear regression analyses of weight loss on HRQL change showed a standardized beta-coefficient of -.430 (p<.001) on the physical dimension, -.288 (p=.004) on the mental dimension, -.432 (p<.001) on the emotional dimension, .287 (p=.008) on number of symptoms, and .274 (p=.009) on reduction of symptom pressure. Morbidly obese participants undergoing RYGB and ILI had improved HRQL after 1 year. The weaker response of ILI on HRQL, compared to RYGB, may be explained by the difference in weight loss following the two treatments.

879,Omeprazole Absorption and Fasting Gastrinemia After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the bariatric surgeries most frequently performed worldwide. Since this operation may predispose to the formation of peptic ulcer of the gastrojejunal anastomosis, the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) is recommended during the first postoperative year. However, so far, there is no detailed knowledge about the absorption of this medication during the immediate postoperative period and consequently about its effectiveness in blocking acid secretion. The objective was to assess the possible endoscopic peptic changes, the absorption of omeprazole (OME), and the status of fasting gastrinemia before and after RYGB operation. OME absorption, the production of its metabolites omeprazole sulfone (OMES) and 5-hydroxyomeprazole (HOME), and basal (fasting) gastrinemia were determined in patients submitted to RYGB before and 2Â months after the operation. Upper digestive endoscopy (UDE) was also performed before and 6Â months after the operation. Twenty patients were studied. Preoperatively, all these patients had some peptic changes and 55% tested positive for Helicobacter pylori. Six months after surgery, ten patients still showed endoscopic changes and one patient tested positive for H. pylori. During the postoperative period, there was a reduction of OME absorption and of the production of its metabolites 90Â min after administration of the drug, and reduction of serum gastrin levels. The standard OME dose (40Â mg) administered after bariatric surgery is insufficient to achieve serum levels that can effectively block the production of hydrochloric acid, permitting the formation of peptic injuries in many patients.",10.1007/s11695-017-2672-z,,,,933
786,An enhanced recovery program for bariatric surgical patients significantly reduces perioperative opioid consumption and postoperative nausea.,"Patients frequently remain in the hospital after bariatric surgery due to pain, nausea, and inability to tolerate oral intake. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) concepts address these perioperative complications and therefore improve length of stay for bariatric surgery patients. To determine if ERAS concepts increase the proportion of patients discharged on postoperative day 1. Secondary objectives included mean length of stay, perioperative opioid use, emergency department visits, and readmissions. A large metropolitan university tertiary hospital. A quantitative before and after study was conducted for patients undergoing bariatric surgical patients. Data were collected surrounding length of stay, perioperative opioid consumption, antiemetic therapy requirements postoperatively, multimodal analgesia compliance, emergency department visits, and hospital readmission rates. Wilcoxon rank-sum and Ï‡2 test were used to compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively. A secondary analysis was performed using Aligned Rank Transformation and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Ï‡2 tests to account for an increase in sleeve gastrectomies in the intervention group. The 2 groups had clinically similar baseline characteristics. Comparison group (N = 366) and ERAS group (N = 715) patients underwent a primary bariatric surgery procedure. There was an increase in the number of patients undergoing a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in the intervention group. After accounting for this increase, the percentage of patients discharged on postoperative day 1 was unchanged (79.8% non-ERAS versus 83.1% ERAS, P = .52). ERAS length of stay was statistically significantly lower for gastric bypass (P<.001) and robotic gastric bypass (P = .01). Perioperative opioid consumption was reduced (41.0 versus 16.2 morphine equivalents, P<0.001), and fewer ERAS patients required postoperative antiemetics (68.8% versus 46.2%, P<.001). Emergency department visits at 7 days were reduced (6.0% versus 3.2%, P = .04), but hospital readmission rates were unchanged. Implementing ERAS did not reduce the percentage of patients discharged on postoperative day 1 in a bariatric surgery program with historically low length of stay, but it led to significant reductions in perioperative opioid use, decreases in postoperative nausea, and early emergency room visits.",10.1016/j.soard.2018.02.010,,,,934
610,The Effect of One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass on Branched-Chain Fatty Acid and Branched-Chain Amino Acid Metabolism in Subjects with Morbid Obesity.,"Subjects with morbid obesity have low levels of serum branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs), which correlate inversely with insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, and inflammation. Recent evidence suggests BCFAs are produced during branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism in human adipose tissue. Elevated concentrations of BCAAs are associated with insulin resistance. In this single-center study, we evaluated the effect of one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) on circulating BCFA and BCAA. Moreover, we determined the expression of genes involved in BCAA catabolism in adipose tissue of patients with obesity and lean controls. Fasting levels of BCFAs and BCAAs were determined by gas and liquid chromatography, respectively, coupled with mass spectrometry, in 50 patients with morbid obesity before and 6-9Â months after surgery, and in 32 lean controls. Visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT and SAT, respectively) biopsies were collected at baseline to determine mRNA levels for enzymes involved in BCAA catabolism. Before surgery, patients with obesity had lower BCFAs and greater BCAAs than control subjects. OAGB increased BCFA and decreased BCAA levels. Insulin resistance (assessed by HOMA) correlated inversely with BCFAs and positively with BCAAs. Expression of genes involved in BCAA catabolism in VAT (but not SAT) was lower in patients with obesity than in lean controls. OAGB-induced weight loss increases circulating BCFAs and decreases circulating BCAAs in patients with morbid obesity, perhaps by altering BCAA catabolism in VAT. We speculate that this shift may be related to the improvement in insulin sensitivity after surgery.",10.1007/s11695-019-04157-z,,,,935
1053,Gastrobronchial Fistula in Sleeve Gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass--A Systematic Review.,"Gastrobronchial fistula (GBF) is a rare surgical complication after bariatric surgery. We aimed to identify the clinical aspects of GBF and establish diagnostic and treatment strategies. A literature search was conducted in December 2013, in the PubMed electronic database. Eleven studies were selected, comprising a total of 36 patients. Most patients presented with a gastric leak prior to the diagnosis of GBF. Mean period until diagnosis was 7.2Â months, and main presenting symptoms were productive cough (nâ€‰=â€‰13) and subphrenic abscess (nâ€‰=â€‰12).

790,A Randomized Trial of a Novel Chewable Multivitamin and Mineral Supplement Following Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.,"Vitamin and mineral deficiencies are common following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and can lead to significant morbidity, but little research on the efficacy of vitamin supplementation regimens exists. We compared the efficacy and tolerability of an investigational versus a standard multivitamin regimen in patients undergoing RYGB. Fifty-six patients, aged 18 to 65, were randomized to an investigational versus a standard multivitamin. Plasma levels of vitamins A, B-12, D, E-Î±, E-Î²/Î³, thiamine, folate, iron, iron-binding capacity, iron saturation, prealbumin, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were measured at 3 and 6Â months postoperatively. Proteins induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA), beta-carotene, coenzyme Q10, and mixed tocopherols were measured at 3Â months postoperatively. Primary outcomes were differences in plasma levels at 3 and 6Â months. Secondary outcomes were palatability, ease of use, and adherence. Twenty-one patients were randomized to the standard regimen and 26 to the investigational multivitamin. Nine were lost to follow-up. At 3Â months, plasma levels of PTHÂ were lower (pâ€‰=â€‰0.042), and levels of vitamin D (pâ€‰=â€‰0.033), thiamine (pâ€‰=â€‰0.009), and beta-carotene (pâ€‰=â€‰0.033) were higher in the investigational multivitamin arm compared to those in the standard regimen arm. Patients receiving the investigational multivitamin reported higher taste satisfaction than those receiving the standard regimen (pâ€‰=â€‰0.035). The investigational multivitamin appears to be more effective than a standard multivitamin in maintaining therapeutic levels of clinically relevant vitamins and minerals, and was more palatable. Additional studies should be conducted to confirm these findings and refine the optimal dosing regimen. www.clinicaltrials.gov under identifier NCT01475617.",10.1007/s11695-018-3177-0,,,,937

1569,Surgery for morbid obesity: selection of operation based on evidence from literature review.,"Bariatric surgery is the therapy for morbid obesity. There are a number of surgical procedures, which are performed by open surgery (OS) and more recently also by laparoscopy (LS). The objective of this study was to consider the evidence for the best bariatric surgical options. Systematic review of the literature was conducted. Morbid obesity studies published between 1990 and 2002 were analyzed. MEDLINE, LiLACS and COCHRANE databases were used, utilizing MeSH terms and free words. Selected studies were analyzed using a specially designed score of methodological quality, to analyze and compare studies. This validated scale is composed by 3 items, and the final score may range between 6 and 36 points. Means, medians and weighted means were calculated, and a comparative analysis by therapy was performed using median 95% confidence intervals (CI). Number of treated patients, reduction in body mass index (BMI), reduction in co-morbidity, %EWL, morbidity and mortality, hospital stay, follow-up, success and failure of operations, and methodological quality were analyzed. 283 related articles were considered. Only 31 of them had selection criteria (these include 5,216 patients operated by OS and 3,230 by LS). Operative mortality was 0.0% for OS and 0.4% for LS. At 36 months, OS techniques show reduction in BMI, %EWL and reductions in co-morbidity of 30.9%, 61.9% and 74.1% respectively. At 36 months, LS techniques show reduction in BMI, %EWL and reduction in comorbidity of 23.7%, 55.9% and 70.9%. Hospital stay was 3.8 days for LS and 7 for OS. At 2-year follow-up, morbidity was 14.8% for LS and 16.7% for OS, and reoperations were 17.7% for LS and 11.3% for OS. Median score for methodological quality was 13 for OS and 11 for LS. Methodological quality of primary studies to 2002 has been poor.",10.1381/0960892052993495,,,,939
41,Medication use before and after bariatric surgery: 5-year results from a randomised controlled trial of banded Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus sleeve gastrectomy in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes.,"Bariatric surgery is an effective tool for weight loss and for improving weight related co-morbidities. Changes in medication usage after a silastic ring laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (SR-LRYGB) compared with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) are unknown. This was a single-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial. Patients were randomised to either SR-LRYGB or LSG. A medication history was obtained at regular follow-up intervals, and mean numbers of prescribed medications were analysed over 5 years. Poisson regression and generalised estimating equations were used to test for statistically significant changes in usage. After eight patients were lost to follow-up, data from 52 patients in each group were available for analysis. There was no difference between the SR-LRYGB or LSG groups in the number of medications prescribed, with the exception of oral glucose-lowering medications, where there was a greater decrease after SR-LRYGB compared to LSG (79% vs 55% respectively) from baseline to 5 years. At 5 years, total medication prescribed was down 10% from pre-operative levels. Prescribed insulin decreased by 72%, and cardiovascular medication decreased by 56% compared to baseline. Prescriptions for analgesia increased by 50%, psychiatric medications by 133% and proton-pump inhibitors by 81%. Both SR-LRYGB and LSG reduced requirement for diabetic and cardiovascular medications, but increased requirement for nutritional supplementation, analgesia and psychiatric medications. There was a greater reduction in oral anti-diabetic medication prescriptions following SR-LRYGB compared to LSG, but no other difference in medication usage between surgical groups was found.",10.26635/6965.6442,,,,940

This study was undertaken to assess changes of bone metabolism following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and adjustable silicone gastric banding (ASGB) as compared to nonoperated controls of morbidly obese subjects. Fourteen female and 5 male patients with a mean (+/-SEM) age of 44.3 +/- 1.8 years participated in the 24-month prospective study. Nine patients underwent ASGB, 4 patients RYGB operation, and 6 patients were included in the control group. Bone metabolism was assessed by determination of serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), osteocalcin, urinary deoxypyridinoline, and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) before, and 6, 12, and 24 months after intervention. The body mass index (BMI) decreased from 41.0 +/- 1.1 to 34.0 +/- 1.4 kg/m2 in the ASGB group (P = .001), from 42.7 +/- 2.2 to 30.5 +/- 2.2 kg/m2 in the RYGB group (P = .006), and remained unchanged in the control group (from 41.2 +/- 1.2 to 41.4 +/- 1.4 kg/m2) after 24 months. Bone mineral content (BMC) showed no significant change in the ASGB group (from 3,079 +/- 140 to 3,064 +/- 129 g) and in the control group (from 2,945 +/- 130 to 2,940 +/- 111 g), whereas it decreased from 2,968 +/- 111 to 2,621 +/- 139 g in the RYGB group (P = .005). The loss in BMC was accompanied by significant increases in urinary deoxypyridinoline (P < .05) and in serum osteocalcin (P < .01) after RYGB, suggesting both, increased bone resorption and increased bone formation. The authors were aware of the fact that the study groups were small and conclusions need to be regarded as preliminary. However, the RYGB operation resulted in enhanced weight loss and significant net loss of bone mass in comparison to ASGB and obese control subjects. Patients losing large amounts of body weight should be monitored regularly regarding prevention of osteoporosis.",10.1016/j.metabol.2004.01.015,,,,941
176,A Meta-Analysis of Endoscopic Stenting Versus Surgical Treatment for Malignant Gastric Outlet Obstruction.,"Surgical gastrojejunostomy (GJJ) and endoscopic stenting (ES) are the two most available treatments for palliation of malignant gastric obstruction (MGOO). The aim of this study is to compare these two techniques regarding efficacy, safety, time of hospitalization and survival. We performed a literature search from January 2010 to September 2020 to identify available randomized controlled studies and observational studies that compared ES and GJJ for the treatment of MGOO. A total of 17 studies were found. ES and GJJ showed similar technical and clinical success rate. ES was superior to obtain early oral re-feeding, shorter length of hospitalization and a lower incidence of complications than GJJ. Surgical palliation had a lower recurrence rate of obstructive symptoms and longer overall survival than ES. Both procedures have advantages and disadvantages. Probably we should not find the best palliation but the best approach based on the patient characteristics and tumor type.",10.1007/s00268-023-06944-3,,,,942
1282,Oxidative stress markers in adults 2 years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Obesity is a chronic disease associated with oxidative stress. Bariatric surgery for the treatment of obesity may affect biomarkers of oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on blood markers of oxidative stress, such as vitamins C and E, Î²-carotene, reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP), and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). A prospective controlled clinical trial was carried out. The participants were distributed into two groups: a control group (n=35), which was evaluated once, and a bariatric group (n=35), which was evaluated at baseline as well as 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. After surgery, the BMI decreased from 47.05Â±1.46 to 30.53Â±1.14 kg/m (P<0.001), but 25.7% of the participants regained weight after 24 months. In relation to the baseline, postsurgery reductions were found in vitamin C (31.9Â±4.6%, P<0.001), Î²-carotene (360.7Â±368.3%, P<0.001), vitamin E (22.8Â±4.1%, P<0.001), GSH (6.6Â±5.2%, P=0.090), CAT (12.7Â±5.6%, P=0.029), and FRAP (1.2Â±3.8%, P=0.085) 2 years after RYGB. TBARS levels decreased after 12 months (71.6Â±2.9%, P<0.001) in relation to the baseline but increased by 195.0Â±28.2% between the 12th and the 24th month (P<0.001). The present findings show that oxidative stress returned 2 years after RYGB. Concentrations of vitamin C, Î²-carotene, GSH, CAT, and FRAP were decreased, whereas the concentration of TBARS decreased in the first year but increased in the following year, which may be partly explained by the imbalance between antioxidants and pro-oxidants.",10.1097/MEG.0b013e32835d0ae0,,,,943
1565,Circadian blood pressure variation in morbidly obese hypertensive patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery.,"Impaired blood pressure (BP) variation, often found in obesity and hypertension, is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The effect of obesity surgery on BP variation is unknown. We performed this study to investigate the effect of gastric bypass surgery on circadian BP variation in morbidly obese hypertensive subjects. The study group consisted of eight patients (mean age 35.0 +/- 9.1 years), with impaired circadian BP rhythm. Controls were eight well-matched subjects (34.6 +/- 9.8 years) with normal BP rhythm. All patients underwent gastric bypass surgery. The 24-h ambulatory BP measurements were performed before (baseline) and 8 weeks after gastric bypass surgery. Mean body weight in the study group and controls decreased from baseline of 129.0 +/- 21.9 kg and 134.1 +/- 27.2 kg to 116.7 +/- 21.1 kg (by 9.5% +/- 2.1%) and 121.6 +/- 25.7 kg (by 9.3% +/- 1.7%) after the surgery, respectively (P < .0001 v baseline). Mean 24-h, daytime, and night-time BP values decreased significantly and similarly in both groups. In the study group mean 24-h systolic and diastolic BP decreased from 154.7 +/- 12.3 mm Hg and 105.6 +/- 8.1 mm Hg to 138.5 +/- 9.3 mm Hg and 90.8 +/- 6.7 mm Hg and in controls from 158.2 +/- 16.5 mm Hg and 106.2 +/- 10.0 mm Hg to 136.3 +/- 10.8 mm Hg and 92.9 +/- 6.3 mm Hg (P < .0001 v baseline), respectively. Circadian BP rhythm in the study group returned to the normal profile (mean systolic nocturnal fall increased from 4.0% +/- 2.4% to 16.4% +/- 4.0% and diastolic, from 5.1% +/- 3.0% to 17.3% +/- 5.5%; P < .0001 v baseline), whereas it remained normal in the controls. Surgery-induced body weight loss in morbidly obese hypertensive subjects with impaired circadian BP variation is not only associated with BP reduction, but also with the restoration of normal BP rhythm.",10.1016/j.amjhyper.2004.10.029,,,,944
163,Closed or Unclosed Mesentery? A Meta-analysis of Internal Herniation After Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.,"During the laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure, closing mesentery or not was still controversial according to preexisted studies. So, the current meta-analysis aimed to compare the outcome of closure versus non-closure of mesenteric defects in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Fifteen studies were included, enrolling 53,488 patients. Based on the outcome of analysis, regarding internal hernia, Petersen space's IH, jejunal mesenteric's IH, hospital days, and reoperation, closure of the mesentery was better than non-closure. Besides, small bowel obstruction, anastomosis ulcer, stenosis, leakage, bleeding, gastrointestinal perforation, and postoperative BMI of patients show no difference between non-closure and closure.",10.1007/s11695-023-06594-3,,,,945
1029,Effect of weight loss on subclinical myocardial injury: A clinical trial comparing gastric bypass surgery and intensive lifestyle intervention.,"To investigate the effect of weight loss induced by bariatric surgery and intensive lifestyle intervention on levels of circulating high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I. We measured high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentrations pre- and 12 months post-intervention in 136 subjects with morbid obesity participating in a controlled clinical trial comparing the effect of intensive lifestyle intervention vs. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. At baseline median (interquartile range) high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I levels were 2.40 (1.28-3.95) ng/L in the bariatric surgery group and 2.35 (1.38-4.40) ng/L in the intensive lifestyle intervention group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.736). The high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentration in a normal-weight control group was 0.90 (0.60-2.13) ng/L. During 12 months of follow-up, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I decreased significantly more in the bariatric surgery group than in the intensive lifestyle intervention group (0.80 (0-1.80) vs. 0.15 (-0.50 to 1.00) ng/L; pâ€‰=â€‰0.002). In a multivariate logistic regression model, surgery emerged as a predictor of reduction in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I levels (odds ratio 2.32; 95% confidence intervals 1.03-5.22; pâ€‰=â€‰0.041) independent of age, gender and other possible confounding baseline variables. In subsequent multivariate analyses, reductions in body weight and triglycerides emerged as possible mediators of reduction in circulating levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I. In patients with morbid obesity, bariatric surgery was associated with a significantly greater reduction in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, an index of subclinical myocardial injury, than intensive lifestyle intervention. The reduction appeared to be mediated by reductions in body weight and serum triglycerides. This suggests that weight loss following bariatric surgery may reduce cardiometabolic stress and subsequent risk of heart failure.",10.1177/2047487315618796,,,,946
177,Association between Surgical Technical Skills and Clinical Outcomes: A Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis.,"A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the association between intraoperative surgical skill and clinical outcomes. Peer-reviewed, original research articles published through August 31, 2021 were identified from PubMed and Embase. From the 1,513 potential articles, seven met eligibility requirements, reporting on 151 surgeons and 17,932 procedures. All included retrospective assessment of operative videos. Associations between surgical skill and outcomes were assessed by pooling odds ratios (OR) using random-effects models with the inverse variance method. Eligible studies included pancreaticoduodenectomy, gastric bypass, laparoscopic gastrectomy, prostatectomy, colorectal, and hemicolectomy procedures. Meta-analytic pooling identified significant associations between the highest vs. lowest quartile of surgical skill and reoperation (OR: 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.23, 0.83), hemorrhage (OR: 0.66; 95% CI, 0.65, 0.68), obstruction (OR: 0.33; 95% CI, 0.30, 0.35), and any medical complication (OR: 0.23, 95% CI, 0.19, 0.27). Nonsignificant inverse associations were noted between skill and readmission, emergency department visit, mortality, leak, infection, venous thromboembolism, and cardiac and pulmonary complications. Overall, surgeon technical skill appears to predict clinical outcomes. However, there are surprisingly few articles that evaluate this association. The authors recommend a thoughtful approach for the development of a comprehensive surgical quality infrastructure that could significantly reduce the challenges identified by this study.",10.4293/JSLS.2022.00076,,,,947
469,Does the Length of the Common Channel as Part of the Total Alimentary Tract Matter? One Year Results from the Multicenter Dutch Common Channel Trial (DUCATI) Comparing Standard Versus Distal Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass with Similar Biliopancreatic Bowel Limb Lengths.,"Although the laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB) is the gold-standard bariatric procedure, it remains uncertain what the optimal bowel limb lengths are to accomplish maximal weight loss while minimizing nutritional deficiencies and related gastro-intestinal complaints. The aim of this randomized controlled multicenter trial is to investigate the effect of significant lengthening of the length of the Roux limb (RL) at the cost of the length of the common channel (CC) while keeping the biliopancreatic limb (BPL) lengths the same on both study arms. Four hundred forty-four patients were randomized to receive either a Very Long Roux Limb LRYGB (VLRL-LRYGB) (variable RL length, BPL 60Â cm, and CC 100Â cm) or a Standard LRYGB (S-LRYGB) (RL 150Â cm, BPL 60Â cm, and a variable CC length). Results at 1-year follow-up for weight loss, effect on obesity-related comorbid conditions, complications, re-operation rate, malnutrition rate, and re-admission rate were investigated. Weight loss at 1-year showed no significant differences for %EWL (84.3% versus 85.3%, pÂ =â€‰0.72) and %TWL (34.2% versus 33.6%, pÂ =â€‰0.359) comparing VLRL-LRYGB versus S-LRYGB. Malabsorption requiring surgical bowel length adjustment was observed in 1.4% in VLRL-LRYGB group versus 0.9% in S-LRYGB group (pÂ =â€‰0.316). Significant lengthening of the RL at the cost of the common channel seems to have no effect on the weight loss at 1-year follow-up, which supports the theory that absorption of nutrients also occurs in the RL. Nevertheless, long-term results of the VLRL-LRYGB have to be awaited to draw final conclusions as part of the discussion towards optimal limb length in LRYGB surgery.",10.1007/s11695-020-04982-7,,,,948
398,Micronutrient status in bariatric surgery patients receiving postoperative supplementation per guidelines: Insights from a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies.,"The micronutrient status and optimal monitoring schedule after bariatric surgery have not been sufficiently assessed. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the longitudinal changes in micronutrient status after bariatric surgery. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for articles that measured preoperative and postoperative serum micronutrient levels in patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Among guideline-adherent studies, the longitudinal changes in micronutrient status were investigated using weighted mean difference (WMD) using a random-effects model. Among the 82 included studies, the guideline adherence rates for micronutrient supplementation after bariatric surgery did not exceed 20%. In patients supplemented per guidelines, vitamin A significantly decreased after RYGB by -7.54 (95% confidence interval [CI], -10.16 to -4.92) Î¼g/dl at 12-23â€‰months, vitamin E decreased after RYGB by -2.35 (95% CI, -3.65 to -1.05) Î¼g/dl at â‰¥24â€‰months, and ferritin by -54.93 (95% CI, -77.19 to -32.67] Î¼g/L at â‰¥24â€‰months after SG, compared with baseline, with moderate level of evidence. Significant decreases in micronutrient levels at certain follow-up intervals in studies with supplementation per guidelines need to be considered to establish a post-bariatric micronutrient monitoring schedule for timely detection and management of micronutrient deficiencies.",10.1111/obr.13249,,,,949
237,Lean mass and strength profile of women submitted to bariatric surgery: comparison of the EWGSOP2 and FNIH classification for sarcopenia - ASBS program phase II.,"Aim: To assess the effect of bariatric surgery on the lean mass of women after one year of the procedure, comparing its outcomes upon the classification from both the Foundation of the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) and the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in the Elderly People (EWGSOP). Material and methods: Twenty-eight obese women aged 40.5â€‰Â±â€‰9.8 yrs who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) were included. 27 of them were reassessed after 6â€‰months of surgery, and 16 completed the one-year follow-up. Pre-sarcopenia condition was assessed through a handgrip strength test and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Total body mass, body mass index, and lean mass (LM) were collected prior to, 6 and 12â€‰months after RYGB surgery. Results: All subjects reassessed after 12â€‰months were diagnosed with pre-sarcopenia according to the FNIH classification criteria, while according to the EWGSOP2 Consensus they presented normal values. LM represented 14% of the influence on handgrip strength (pâ€‰=â€‰.049) after 6â€‰months of surgery; however, its influence on strength after 12â€‰months increased to 30% (pâ€‰=â€‰.028). Conclusion: The FNIH classification is the most effective criteria since it uses LM content as the first test, considering that strength capacity needs more time to be affected by the surgical procedure. On the other hand, the EWGSOP2 classification should not be applied to determine the loss of LM in younger populations regardless of what may have caused such changes.",10.1080/09513590.2022.2119956,,,,950
641,"The Use of Intraperitoneal Bupivacaine in Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: a Double-blind, Randomized Controlled Trial.","Several studies have shown a reduction in postoperative pain and length of hospital stay when using intraperitoneal local anesthetics during laparoscopic surgery. In morbidly obese patients, respiratory depression due to opioid use is a serious side effect. Any different type of analgesia is therefore clinically relevant. To assess the effect of intraperitoneal bupivacaine on postoperative pain after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). Between March and November 2017, 130 patients were included and randomly assigned to receive 20Â ml or 0Â ml of 2.5% bupivacaine hydrochloride sprayed onto the diaphragm. Pain scores for abdominal and shoulder pain were conducted using the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain score at 0, 1, 6, and 24Â h postoperatively. The length of hospital stay and use of analgesics was recorded in digital patient records. The primary outcome is the pain scores and the secondary outcomes are postoperative use of opioids or antiemetics and length of hospital stay. The study and control group contained respectively 66 and 61 patients. Patient characteristics were equal in both groups (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), except for age. No significant reduction of postoperative pain or opioid use was seen with the use of intraperitoneal bupivacaine. There was also no significant reduction in the use of antiemetics and length of hospital stay. The use of intraperitoneal bupivacaine in LRYGB does not show a statistically significant reduction in postoperative pain or postoperative opioid use. Therefore, using intraperitoneal bupivacaine has no clinical relevance and should no longer be used in LRYGB.",10.1007/s11695-019-03982-6,,,,951
1392,A novel procedure for Roux-en-Y reconstruction following laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy: transoral placement of anvil and intracorporeal gastrojejunostomy via umbilical mini-laparotomy.,"We describe herein our procedures for Roux-en-Y reconstruction using a transoral anvil following laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG). The procedure consists of three technical processes: transoral placement of the anvil with the head pre-tilted, extracorporeal preparation of the Roux-en-Y limb, and intracorporeal gastrojejunostomy with a circular stapler introduced via an umbilical mini-laparotomy. We applied the procedure to 33 patients with early gastric cancer between December 2008 and June 2010. None of the patients suffered from surgical complications related either to the transoral placement of the anvil or the anastomoses. The postoperative wound appearance was much less conspicuous than that of conventional laparoscopic distal gastrectomy, because our procedure needed only a 4-cm mini-laparotomy on the umbilicus, except for the trocar ports. This technique involving transoral anvil placement enables intracorporeal anastomosis for gastrojejunostomy via an umbilical mini-laparotomy, and may be one of the surgical choices for anastomosis and Roux-en-Y reconstruction following LADG.",10.1007/s10120-011-0013-9,,,,952
344,A randomized clinical trial on the effects of exercise on muscle remodelling following bariatric surgery.,"Muscle atrophy and strength loss are common adverse outcomes following bariatric surgery. This randomized, controlled trial investigated the effects of exercise training on bariatric surgery-induced loss of muscle mass and function. Additionally, we investigated the effects of the intervention on molecular and histological mediators of muscle remodelling. Eighty women with obesity were randomly assigned to a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB: nÂ =Â 40, ageÂ =Â 42Â Â±Â 8Â years) or RYGB plus exercise training group (RYGBÂ +Â ET: nÂ =Â 40, ageÂ =Â 38Â Â±Â 7Â years). Clinical and laboratory parameters were assessed at baseline, and 3 (POST3) and 9Â months (POST9) after surgery. The 6Â month, three-times-a-week, exercise intervention (resistance plus aerobic exercise) was initiated 3Â months post-surgery (for RYGBÂ +Â ET). A healthy, lean, age-matched control group was recruited to provide reference values for selected variables. Surgery resulted in a similar (PÂ =Â 0.66) reduction in lower-limb muscle strength in RYGB and RYGB+ET (-26% vs. -31%), which was rescued to baseline values in RYGBÂ +Â ET (PÂ =Â 0.21 vs. baseline) but not in RYGB (PÂ <Â 0.01 vs. baseline). Patients in RYGB+ET had greater absolute (214 vs. 120Â kg, PÂ <Â 0.01) and relative (2.4 vs. 1.4Â kg/body mass, PÂ <Â 0.01) muscle strength compared with RYGB alone at POST9. Exercise resulted in better performance in timed-up-and-go (6.3 vs. 7.1Â s, PÂ =Â 0.05) and timed-stand-test (18 vs. 14 repetitions, PÂ <Â 0.01) compared with RYGB. Fat-free mass was lower (POST9-PRE) after RYBG than RYGBÂ +Â ET (total: -7.9 vs. -4.9Â kg, PÂ <Â 0.01; lower-limb: -3.8 vs. -2.7Â kg, PÂ =Â 0.02). Surgery reduced Types I (~Â -Â 21%; PÂ =Â 0.99 between-group comparison) and II fibre cross-sectional areas (~Â -Â 27%; PÂ =Â 0.88 between-group comparison), which were rescued to baseline values in RYGB+ET (PÂ >Â 0.05 vs. baseline) but not RYGB (PÂ >Â 0.01 vs. baseline). RYGBÂ +Â ET showed greater Type I (5187 vs. 3898Â Î¼m2 , PÂ <Â 0.01) and Type II (5165 vs. 3565Â Î¼m2 , PÂ <Â 0.01) fCSA than RYGB at POST9. RYGBÂ +Â ET also resulted in increased capillarization (PÂ <Â 0.01) and satellite cell content (PÂ <Â 0.01) than RYGB at POST9. Gene-set normalized enrichment scores for the muscle transcriptome revealed that the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway was suppressed in RYGBÂ +Â ET at POST9 vs. PRE (NES: -1.7; PÂ <Â 0.01), but not in RYGB. Atrogin-1 gene expression was lower in RYGBÂ +Â ET vs. RYGB at POST9 (0.18 vs. 0.71-fold change, PÂ <Â 0.01). From both genotypic and phenotypic perspectives, the muscle of exercised patients resembled that of healthy lean individuals. This study provides compelling evidence-from gene to function-that strongly supports the incorporation of exercise into the recovery algorithm for bariatric patients so as to counteract the post-surgical loss of muscle mass and function.",10.1002/jcsm.12815,,,,953
823,Effect of sitagliptin on glucose control in type 2 diabetes mellitus after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.,"The present study was a 4-week randomized trial to assess the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitor, in persistent or recurring type 2 diabetes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB). Participants (nâ€‰=â€‰32) completed a mixed meal test (MMT) and self-monitoring of plasma glucose (SMPG) before and 4â€‰weeks after randomization to either sitagliptin 100â€‰mg daily or placebo daily. Questionnaires were administered to assess gastrointestinal discomfort. Outcome variables were glucose, active glucagon-like peptide-1 and Î²-cell function during the MMT, and glucose levels during SMPG. Age (56.3â€‰Â±â€‰8.2â€‰years), body mass index (34.4â€‰Â±â€‰6.7â€‰kg/m2 ), glycated haemoglobin (7.21â€‰Â±â€‰0.77%), diabetes duration (12.9â€‰Â±â€‰10.0â€‰years), years since RYGB (5.6â€‰Â±â€‰3.3â€‰years) and Î²-cell function did not differ between the placebo and sitagliptin groups at pre-intervention. Sitagliptin was well tolerated, decreased postprandial glucose levels during the MMT (from 8.31â€‰Â±â€‰1.92â€‰mmol/L to 7.67â€‰Â±â€‰1.59â€‰mmol/L, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.03) and mean SMPG levels, but had no effect on Î²-cell function. In patients with diabetes and mild hyperglycemia after RYGB, a short course of sitagliptin provided a small but significant glucose-lowering effect, with no identified improvement in Î²-cell function.",10.1111/dom.13139,,,,954
722,Comparison between Enteroscopy-Based and Laparoscopy-Assisted ERCP for Accessing the Biliary Tree in Patients with Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Although balloon-assisted enteroscopy-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (BAE-ERCP) is a well-described means of accessing the duodenal papilla in patients with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), it is associated with modest clinical success rates. Laparoscopy-assisted ERCP (LA-ERCP)-performed by advancing a standard duodenoscope through a gastrostomy into the excluded stomach and duodenum-has emerged as a viable alternative to BAE-ERCP, with apparently higher success rates. In this systematic review, we compare LA-ERCP with enteroscopy-based techniques in post-RYGB patients, including 22 case series that provided data on papilla identification, papilla cannulation, and complications. We found that LA-ERCP was superior to the enteroscopy-based techniques in its capacity to reach the duodenal papilla, although complication rates were lower for the latter. Comparative studies are needed in order to corroborate our findings.",10.1007/s11695-018-3507-2,,,,955
1179,Recruitment of lung volume during surgery neither affects the postoperative spirometry nor the risk of hypoxaemia after laparoscopic gastric bypass in morbidly obese patients: a randomized controlled study.,"Intraoperative recruitment manoeuvres (RMs) combined with PEEP reverse the decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC) associated with anaesthesia and improve intraoperative oxygenation. Whether these benefits persist after operation remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that intraoperative RMs associated with PEEP improve postoperative spirometry including FRC and reduce the incidence of postoperative hypoxaemia in morbidly obese (MO) patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass. After IRB approval and informed consent, 50 MO patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass under volume-controlled ventilation (tidal volume 6 ml kg(-1) of IBW) were randomly ventilated with either 10 cm Hâ‚‚O PEEP or with 10 cm Hâ‚‚O PEEP and one RM carried out after induction of pneumoperitoneum, and another after exsufflation. Anaesthesia and analgesia were standardized. Spirometry was assessed before operation and 24 h after surgery. Postoperative oxygenation and the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) were recorded during the first postoperative night. Age, BMI, and STOP BANG score were similar in both groups. FRC decrease after surgery was minimal [0.15 (0.14) litre in control and 0.38 (0.19) litre in the RM group] and similar between the groups (P=0.35). FVC, FEV1, mean [Formula: see text], percentage of time spent with [Formula: see text] below 90%, and AHI did not differ significantly between the groups. This study demonstrates that when added to a protective mechanical ventilation combining low tidal volume and high PEEP, two RMs do not improve postoperative lung function including FRC, arterial oxygenation, and the incidence of obstructive apnoea in MO patients after laparoscopic upper abdominal surgery.

384,Liver transplantation and bariatric surgery: a new surgical reality: a systematic review of the best time for bariatric surgery.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has increased in parallel with the obesity. This situation represents a new reality for patients with an indication for liver transplant (LT) and bariatric surgery (BS). We undertook a systematic review of BS and LT using the terms 'liver transplant', 'obesity' and 'bariatric surgery'. The variables analyzed were number of patients, technique and timing of BS, surgical complications, follow-up and mortality. A total of 190 papers were identified and, 28 articles were discussed (6 papers with BS before a LT, 6 with both procedures simultaneously and 16 studies with BS after a LT). In the last 7 years, 22 of the 28 papers (78.6%) were published on this subject. A total of 144 patients had both procedures: 27 (18.8%) before, 42 (29.1%) simultaneously and 75 (52.1%) after. Sleeve gastrectomy was the most performed BS (121 cases-84%) followed by a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (20 cases-13.9%). The number of publications has increased substantially in recent years. The majority papers of BS after LT could be explained because of commodity of the flow of these patients. The best moment to perform BS in these patients has yet to be established.",10.1007/s13304-021-01106-3,,,,957
1393,Gastric bypass surgery is associated with near-normal insulin suppression of lipolysis in nondiabetic individuals.,"We hypothesized that individuals who have undergone gastric bypass have greater insulin sensitivity that obese subjects but less compared with lean. We measured free fatty acid (FFA) and glucose kinetics during a two-step, hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp in nondiabetic subjects who were 38 Â± 5 mo post-gastric bypass surgery (GB; n = 15), in lean subjects (L; n = 15), and in obese subjects (O; n = 16). Fasting FFAa were not significantly different between the three study groups but during both doses of insulin were significantly higher in O than in either GB or L. The effective insulin concentration resulting in half-maximal suppression of FFA was similar in L and GB and significantly less in both groups compared with O. Glucose infusion rates during low-dose insulin were not significantly different in GB compared with either L or O. During high-dose insulin, glucose infusion rates were significantly greater in GB than in O but less than in L. Endogenous glucose production in GB was significantly lower than O only during low dose of insulin. We conclude that gastric bypass is associated with improvements in adipose tissue insulin sensitivity to levels similar to lean, healthy persons and also with improvements in the response of glucose metabolism to insulin. These changes may be due to preferential reduction in visceral fat and decreased FFA availability. However, some differences in insulin sensitivity in GB remain compared with L. Residual insulin resistance may be related to excess total body fat or abnormal lipolysis and requires further study.",10.1152/ajpendo.00596.2010,,,,958
858,Contribution of Malabsorption to Weight Loss After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: a Systematic Review.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is traditionally classified as a combined restrictive and malabsorptive operation. This notion of the operation influences its technical variations and revisions for patients who do not achieve significant weight loss after this surgery. There is an increasing body of literature suggesting a role for appetite suppression mediated by neuro-hormonal signals after RYGB. The purpose of this paper was to systematically review published English language scientific literature to determine the role of malabsorption towards weight loss achieved with RYGB. This review finds that there is little or no malabsorption of carbohydrates or protein after RYGB but there is some fat malabsorption. Overall, malabsorption makes a little (approximately 11.0% in the early period) overall contribution to weight loss after RYGB.",10.1007/s11695-017-2762-y,,,,959
511,ERCP with overtube-assisted enteroscopy in patients with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass anatomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in patients with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) anatomy is challenging. Overtube-assisted enteroscopy (OAE) is usually needed to perform ERCP in these patients. There is significant variation in the reported rates of success and adverse events across published studies. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to reliably estimate the pooled rates of success and adverse events. We performed a systematic search of multiple electronic databases through February 2020 to identify studies reporting outcomes of OAE-ERCP in post-RYGB patients. The pooled rates of enteroscopy success, technical success, and adverse events were estimated for OAE-ERCP. The pooled rates of success and adverse events were also estimated for ERCP using double-balloon enteroscopes (DBE) alone. 10 studies reporting a total of 398 procedures were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled rates of enteroscopy and technical success of OAE-ERCP were 75.3â€Š% (95â€Š% confidence interval [CI] 64.5â€Š-â€Š83.6) and 64.8â€Š% (95â€Š%CI 53.1â€Š-â€Š74.9) respectively. The pooled rate of adverse events was 8.0â€Š% (95â€Š%CI 5.2â€Š-â€Š12.2). The pooled rates of enteroscopy and technical success of DBE-ERCP (four studies) were 83.5â€Š% (95â€Š%CI 68.3â€Š-â€Š92.2) and 72.5â€Š% (95â€Š%CI 52.3â€Š-â€Š86.4), respectively. The pooled rate of adverse events with DBE-ERCP was 9.0â€Š% (95â€Š%CI 5.4â€Š-â€Š14.5). Substantial heterogeneity was noted. OAE-ERCP appears to be effective and safe in post-RYGB patients. Among the currently available techniques, OAE-ERCP is the least invasive approach in this challenging group of patients. Future studies comparing the effectiveness and safety of alternative novel techniques, such as endosonography-directed transgastric ERCP, with OAE-ERCP are needed.",10.1055/a-1178-9741,,,,960
501,Motivation and Weight Loss Expectations in Bariatric Surgery Candidates: Association with 1- and 2-Year Results After Bariatric Surgery.,"There are discrepancies between patients' expected weight loss and what is considered achievable after bariatric surgery. This study describes the association between patients' expectations and actual weight loss, 1 and 2Â years postoperatively. A prospective observational study was performed. The association between expectations and actual weight loss (% total weight loss) was explored using linear regression analyses, adjusting for baseline demographics, surgery types, and self-esteem (Rosenberg self-esteem scale) and repeated separately per gender. Gender differences in motivations were explored using Chi-square tests. Of 440 patients at baseline, results on 368 (84%) at 1Â year and 341 (78%) patients at 2Â years were available. Significant and opposite associations were found when analyzing genders separately. There was a significant negative association between expectations and %TWL in men at 1Â year (Î² -â€‰0.23, pâ€‰=â€‰0.04) and 2Â years postoperatively (Î² -â€‰0.26, pâ€‰=â€‰0.03), indicating smaller weight loss for greater expectations. In women, a significant positive association (Î² 0.24, pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) was found 2Â years postoperatively, indicating greater weight loss for greater expectations. Both genders were mainly motivated by health concerns, but women were also motivated by reduced self-confidence to lose weight. Higher expectations were negatively associated with weight loss in men, but positively in women. This may be due to men being motivated by physical complaints, which improve with lower weight-loss. Women are also driven by reduced self-confidence, which may influence weight loss maintenance behaviors. Higher weight loss goals should not be considered as a contra-indication for surgery, but may be utilized to achieve patients' goals.",10.1007/s11695-020-04811-x,,,,961
988,Early effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on peptides and hormones involved in the control of energy balance.,"Body weight varies depending on the prevailing direction of environmental pressures; however, physiological factors also play a significant role in the control of body weight. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on hormones and peptides involved in the control of energy balance and their possible implications in appetite/satiety. The sample included 39 individuals with extreme obesity (37 women and two men) who underwent RYGB. Anthropometric and biochemical markers were collected before surgery and 6 months after RYGB. The BMI decreased from 44.3Â±6.4 to 31.7Â±5.7â€‰kg/m (P<0.001) at the sixth month. Percentage of excess weight lost was 63.2Â±25.0%. Leptin and glucose levels decreased significantly 6 months after RYGB (P<0.001). Interestingly, a significant correlation was confirmed between the anorexigenic gut hormone peptide YY (PYY) and the central anorexigenic mediator Î±-melanocyte-stimulating hormone after 6 months of RYGB (r=0.35, P=0.004). In contrast, PYY concentrations were correlated negatively with BMI (r=-0.34, P=0.002). In the present investigation, it was found that there is a relationship between Î±-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and PYY concentrations, and it supports the role of the PYY to POMC signal in appetite regulation after RYGB.",10.1097/MEG.0000000000000665,,,,962
467,Gastric bypass surgery is associated with reduced subclinical myocardial injury and greater activation of the cardiac natriuretic peptide system than lifestyle intervention.,"Morbid obesity is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The relative effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (GBS) and intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) on subclinical myocardial injury, the activity of the cardiac natriuretic system, and systemic inflammation remain unclear. In a 59-week non-randomized clinical trial that included 131 patients with morbid obesity, we compared the effects ofGBS and ILI on concentrations of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and I (cTnI), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and C-reactive protein (CRP). In the GBS and ILI group, median body mass index (BMI) was reduced by 14.4Â kg/m2 versus 3.9Â kg/m2, respectively (p valueÂ <Â 0.001). Cardiac troponins decreased after GBS, pÂ =Â 0.014 (cTnT) and pÂ =Â 0.065 (cTnI) and increased significantly in those treated with ILI (p valuesÂ â‰¤Â 0.021) (between-group differences for deltas: pÂ â‰¤Â 0.003). NT-proBNP increased in both groups, but significantly more in the GBS than in the ILI group (between-group differences for deltas: pÂ =Â 0.008). CRP decreased significantly within the GBS and the ILI group, with this change significantly greater in the GBS group (between-group differences for deltas pÂ <Â 0.001). The dominating mediator of the biomarker changes was weight loss. Prior coronary artery disease and diabetes were predictive of the magnitude of the changes in cTnI and NT-proBNP, respectively. Compared to ILI, GBS was associated with reduced subclinical myocardial injury and systemic inflammation, and enhancement of the cardiac natriuretic peptide system. The biomarker changes were predominantly mediated by weight loss.",10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2020.09.006,,,,963
544,Changes in Smoking Behavior Before and After Gastric Bypass: A 7-year Study.,"To evaluate smoking history and change in smoking behavior, from 1 year before through 7 years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, and to identify risk factors for post-surgery smoking. Smoking behavior in the context of bariatric surgery is poorly described. Adults undergoing RYGB surgery entered a prospective cohort study between 2006 and 2009 and were followed up to 7 years until â‰¤2015. Participants (N = 1770; 80% female, median age 45 years, median body mass index 47â€Škg/m2) self-reported smoking history pre-surgery, and current smoking behavior annually. Almost half of participants (45.2%) reported a pre-surgery history of smoking. Modeled prevalence of current smoking decreased in the year before surgery from 13.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 12.1-15.4] to 2.2% (95% CI = 1.5-2.9) at surgery, then increased to 9.6% (95% CI = 8.1-11.2) 1-year post-surgery and continued to increase to 14.0% (95% CI = 11.8-16.0) 7-years post-surgery. Among smokers, mean packs/day was 0.60 (95% CI = 0.44-0.77) at surgery, 0.70 (95% CI = 0.62-0.78) 1-year post-surgery and 0.77 (95% CI = 0.68-0.88) 7-years post-surgery. At 7-years, smoking was reported by 61.7% (95% CI = 51.9-70.8) of participants who smoked 1-year pre-surgery (n = 221), 12.3% (95% CI = 8.5-15.7) of participants who formerly smoked but quit >1 year pre-surgery (n = 507), and 3.8% (95% CI = 2.1-4.9) of participants who reported no smoking history (n = 887). Along with smoking history (ie, less time since smoked), younger age, household income <$25,000, being married or living as married, and illicit drug use were independently associated with increased risk of post-surgery smoking. Although most adults who smoked 1-year before RYGB quit pre-surgery, smoking prevalence rebounded across 7-years, primarily due to relapse.",10.1097/SLA.0000000000003828,,,,964
724,Delayed gastric emptying following pancreatoduodenectomy: a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy vs Billroth II gastrojejunostomy randomized study.,"delayed gastric emptying (DGE) is the most common complication after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and it occurs in 50% of cases. the endpoint was to determine if there were any differences in the incidence of DGE between Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy (ReY) and Billroth II gastrojejunostomy (BII) in PD with pancreaticogastrostomy (PG). this was a case-control prospective randomized study of all PD cases between 2013 and 2016. Sixty-four patients were included, 32 in each group. An intention-to-treat statistical analysis was performed. no significant differences were found with regard to morbidity and mortality or hospital stay. DGE was present in 25% of the patients in the BII group in comparison to 15.6% in the ReY group, which was not statistically significant (p = 0.35). There was a higher percentage of patients with primary DGE in the BII group, 12.5% versus 6.2%, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.53). No difference in DGE severity was observed. Male gender (OR 8.38 [1.1; 129]), abdominal complications (OR 15 [1.7; 396.9]), pre-operative malnutrition (OR 99.7 [3.3, 11,126]) and hemorrhage (OR 9.4 [1.37, 107.94]) were the main risk factors for DGE according to the multivariate analysis. there were no significant differences in the incidence or severity of DGE between BII or ReY after PD with PG.",10.17235/reed.2018.5744/2018,,,,965
1327,The effect of gastric bypass on the pharmacokinetics of serotonin reuptake inhibitors.,"Morbidly obese patients frequently present with mood and anxiety disorders, which are often treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs). Having observed that patients treated with SRIs frequently relapse after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, the authors sought to assess whether SRI bioavailability is reduced postoperatively. Twelve gastric bypass candidates treated with an SRI for primary mood or anxiety disorders were studied prospectively. Timed blood samples for SRI plasma levels were drawn for pharmacokinetic studies before surgery and 1, 6, and 12 months afterward. Maximum concentration, time to maximum concentration, and area under the concentration/time curve (AUC) were determined. In eight of the 12 patients, AUC values 1 month after surgery dropped to an average of 54% (SD=18) of preoperative levels (range=36%-80%); in six of these patients, AUC values returned to baseline levels (or greater) by 6 months. Four patients had an exacerbation of depressive symptoms, which resolved by 12 months in three of them. Three of the four patients had a reduced AUC level at 1 month and either gained weight or failed to lose weight between 6 and 12 months. Normalization of the AUC was associated with improvement in symptom scores. Patients taking SRIs in this study were at risk for reduced drug bioavailability 1 month after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The authors recommend close psychiatric monitoring after surgery.",10.1176/appi.ajp.2011.11050719,,,,966
336,Medium/long term evaluation of lipid profile after bariatric surgery (gastric bypass versus sleeve gastrectomy).,"Bariatric surgery aims to reduce weight and resolve the comorbidities associated with obesity. Few studies have assessed mid/long-term changes in lipid profile with sleeve gastrectomy versus gastric bypass. This study was conducted to assess and compare changes in lipid profile with each procedure after 60 months. This was an observational, retrospective study of analytical cohorts enrolling 100 patients distributed into two groups: 50 had undergone gastric bypass (GBP) surgery and 50 sleeve gastrectomy (SG) surgery. Total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglyceride (TG) levels were measured before surgery and at 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months. Weight loss and the resolution of dyslipidemia with each of the procedures were also assessed. Ninety-five of the 100 patients completed follow-up. At 60 months, TC and LDL levels had significantly decreased in the BPG group (167.42â€¯Â±â€¯31.22â€¯mg/dl and 88.06â€¯Â±â€¯31.37â€¯mg/dl, respectively), while there were no differences in the SG group. Increased HDL levels were seen with both procedures (BPG: 62.69â€¯Â±â€¯16.3â€¯mg/dl vs. SG: 60.64â€¯Â±â€¯18.73â€¯mg/dl), with no difference between the procedures. TG levels decreased in both groups (BPG: 86.06â€¯Â±â€¯56.57â€¯mg/dl vs. SG: 111.09â€¯Â±â€¯53.08â€¯mg/dl), but values were higher in the BPG group (Pâ€¯<â€¯.05). The percentage of overweight lost (PSP) was higher in the BPG group: 75.65â€¯Â±â€¯22.98â€¯mg/dl vs. the GV group: 57.83â€¯Â±â€¯27.95â€¯mg/dl. Gastric bypass achieved better mid/long-term results in terms of weight reduction and the resolution of hypercholesterolemia as compared to sleeve gastrectomy. While gastric bypass improved all lipid profile parameters, sleeve gastrectomy only improved HDL and triglyceride levels.",10.1016/j.endien.2021.10.007,,,,967
793,Conversion to laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy after failure of laparoscopic gastric band: A systematic review of the literature and cost considerations.,"No universal consensus has been achieved as to whether the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band to laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy conversion should be performed in one or two steps. To determine the differences in operative outcomes and cost, a systematic, comprehensive review of the literature was conducted using the PubMed database from the National Institutes of Health. Nine studies were included with 809 patients. Weighted averages were calculated to compare operative outcomes, and cost analyses were conducted with these averages. Results indicate a longer operative time for the one-step approach than the two-step approach, but studies included in the meta-analysis found no statistical difference between the two. The two-step approach was found to have a longer length of hospital stay, but this finding refuted included studies that indicate no significant difference. Complication rates were higher for the one-step approach than the two-step approach, and costs associated with complications average $806 more for one-step patients than two-step patients. This suggests that the two-step approach could prove better for patient safety and cost outcomes, but both approaches are comparable in operating time and length of stay.",10.1016/j.orcp.2017.12.004,,,,968
1591,Surgical management of obesity using a soft adjustable gastric band.,"Laparoscopically inserted adjustable gastric bands are an effective means of weight reduction for obese patients. The Swedish Adjustable Gastric Band was evaluated prospectively in a consecutive series of 273 patients from August 1996 to March 2003. The first 58 patients had their band sited by the 'peri-gastric' technique, with the subsequent 215 using the 'pars flaccida' technique, which provides better posterior fixation of the band. Results from these two groups were considered separately. Prolapse of the stomach through the band was the major complication occurring in 13 of the 58 peri-gastric patients (22.4%). Median preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 42.1, falling below 30 by 2 years. In the pars flaccida group there were no instances of prolapse, but the major complication was three cases of band erosion (1.4%). Median preoperative BMI was 42.9 for this group, falling to 32 by 3 years. There was one death in the series due to myocardial infarction. Results compare favourably with other published adjustable gastric band series. Weight loss with the SAGB appears durable overall with an acceptable complication rate once an appropriate technique is employed. Consistent life-long follow up is necessary to achieve the best result.",10.1111/j.1445-2197.2004.03027.x,,,,969
685,Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Bariatric Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy and Laparoscopic Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass.,"Few investigations have been conducted that compared blood glucose in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM2) and morbid obesity who had undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or gastric bypass (LRYGB). We aimed to compare the effects of these procedures using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). We prospectively studied patients that had qualified for LSG or LRYGB. The inclusion criteria were DM2 of â‰¤â€‰5Â years, for which patients were taking oral anti-diabetic drugs, or no glucose metabolism disorder; and morbid obesity. CGM was performed between admission and the 10th postoperative day. We studied 16 patients with DM2 and 16 without. Eighteen patients underwent LSG and 14 underwent LRYGB. The median hemoglobin A1c was 5.5% (5.4-5.9%) in DM2 patients, which did not differ from control (pâ€‰=â€‰0.460). Preoperative mean daily glucose concentration was similar between DM2 and control patients (pâ€‰=â€‰0.622). For patients with DM2, LRYGB was associated with more frequent low glucose status, and these episodes lasted longer than in DM2 patients that underwent LSG (pâ€‰=â€‰0.035 and 0.049, respectively). DM2 patients that underwent LRYGB demonstrated lower glucose concentrations from third postoperative day than those that underwent LSG. Patients without DM2 did not demonstrate differences in daily mean glucose concentrations, or in incidence nor duration of hypoglycemia throughout the observation period. A significantly larger reduction in interstitial glucose concentration is present from third day in patients with DM2 who undergo LRYGB vs. LSG, accompanied by a lower incidence and shorter duration of low glucose episodes.",10.1007/s11695-018-03684-5,,,,970
396,Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass Versus Sleeve Gastrectomy Plus Procedures for Treatment of Morbid Obesity: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) are the most commonly performed bariatric procedures globally, but both techniques have shortcomings. Several modifications of SG (SG plus procedures) have been developed, but the efficacy of the different procedures has not been completely elucidated. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SG plus procedures. Out of the initially identified 2357 studies, thirteen were selected for this meta-analysis: two studies on banded sleeve gastrectomy (BSG), four studies on sleeve gastrectomy plus duodenal-jejunal bypass (SGâ€‰+â€‰DJB) or sleeve gastrectomy with loop duodenal-jejunal bypass (SADJB), two studies on sleeve gastrectomy with jejunal-jejunal bypass (SGâ€‰+â€‰JJB), four studies on single anastomosis duodenal-ileal switch (SADI-S), and one study on stomach intestinal pylorus-sparing surgery (SIPS). SADI-S procedure was found to achieve significantly greater percentage of excess weight loss than the RYGB. SGâ€‰+â€‰DJB and SADJB achieved greater weight loss than the RYGB. Major complications were fewer with SGâ€‰+â€‰JJB than with RYGB, but the difference was not significant. Overall, SG plus procedures appear to achieve better weight loss and cause fewer complications than RYGB.",10.1007/s11695-021-05456-0,,,,971
1553,Incidence of regurgitation after the banded gastric bypass.,"Frequent regurgitation is a common complication following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP). This study investigated the risk of becoming a chronic regurgitator, by considering silicone ring size and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) function, and their relationship with weight loss. 80 morbidly obese patients were randomly selected to undergo surgery using ring length of 62 mm (40 patients, group A) or 77 mm (40 patients, group B), with 6 months' postoperative follow-up. Preoperative esophageal manometry parameters were correlated with occurrence of chronic postoperative regurgitation. Patients were considered to present chronic regurgitation when this occurred on >10 days/month. The groups were homogeneous regarding age, gender, race, weight, BMI (47.8+/-6.1 vs 50.2+/-6.4 kg/m2) and obesity-related diseases. There were 15% more chronic regurgitators in group A than in group B. Chronic regurgitators in group A lost more weight than chronic regurgitators in group B (P=0.026) or non-chronic regurgitators in group A (P=0.016). A greater proportion of chronic regurgitators had LES hypotonia (mean respiratory pressure <14 mmHg) than did non-chronic regurgitators (P=0.008). Logistic regression demonstrated that the chance of being a chronic regurgitator in group A was 4.5 times greater than in group B (P=0.046), and that the chance of a chronic regurgitator having LES hypotonia was seven times greater than of having normal LES pressure (P=0.006). Silicone ring size and LES hypotonia are independent prognostic factors for chronic regurgitation following RYGBP. Ring size and chronic regurgitation contribute significantly towards weight loss during the first 6 postoperative months.",10.1381/096089205774859209,,,,972
609,Antecolic reconstruction is associated with a lower incidence of delayed gastric emptying compared to retrocolic technique after Whipple or pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy.,"The aim of present study is to investigate the relationship between the antecolic (AC) route of gastrojejunostomy (GJ) after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) or duodenojejunostomy (DJ) reconstruction after pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD), and the incidence of delayed gastric emptying (DGE). An electronic search of 4 databases to identify all articles comparing AC and retrocolic (RC) reconstruction after PD or PPPD was performed. Fifteen studies involving 2270 patients were included for final pooled analysis. The overall incidence of DGE was 27.2%. Meta-analysis results showed AC group had lower incidence of DGE (odds ratio, 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.52, Pâ€Š<â€Š.0001) and shorter hospital length of stay (weight mean difference, -3.29; 95% CI, -5.2 to -1.39, Pâ€Š=â€Š.0007). Days until to liquid and solid diet in the AC group were also significantly earlier than that in the RC group (Pâ€Š=â€Š.0006 and Pâ€Š<â€Š.0001). There was no difference in operative time, incidence of pancreatic fistula and bile leakage, and mortality, respectively. AC route of GJ after PD or DJ after PPPD is associated with a lower incidence of DGE. However, the preferred route for GJ or DJ reconstruction remains to be investigated in well-powered, randomized, controlled trial.",10.1097/MD.0000000000016663,,,,973
102,Role of Ursodeoxycholic Acid in the Prevention of Gallstones Formation in Bariatric Patients-a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomised Trials.,"The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess whether treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery reduces gallstone formation. A systematic literature search was performed using electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Web of Science, PROSPERO, Google Scholar and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry platform). RCTs without restrictions on study language, year, status of publication and patient's age were used. Pooled risk ratios were calculated using a random-effects model. Subgroup analyses for drug dose, duration and procedure types were performed. Sensitivity analyses and a summary of findings table were generated to assess the robustness and the level of evidence provided, respectively. Fourteen trials were included (3619 patients, 2292 in UDCA vs 1327 in control group). Procedures included SG, RYGB, OAGB, AGB and Gastroplasty. UDCA dose ranged from 300 to 1200Â mg per day. Gallstone formation occurred in 19.3% (8.3% in UDCA vs 38.1% in the control group). UDCA significantly reduced the risk of gallstone formation (14 trials, 3619 patients; RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.18-0.41; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). UDCA significantly reduced the risk of symptomatic gallstone disease (6 trials, 2458 patients; RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.21-0.43; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). No subgroup difference was found for different doses, duration and type of procedure performed. Oral UDCA treatment significantly reduces the risks of developing gallstones in postoperative bariatric patients from 38 to 8%. The use of 500 to 600Â mg UDCA for 6Â months is effective and should be implemented in all patients post-bariatric surgery.",10.1007/s11695-023-06893-9,,,,974
995,Palliative Therapy for Gastric Outlet Obstruction Caused by Unresectable Gastric Cancer: A Meta-analysis Comparison of Gastrojejunostomy with Endoscopic Stenting.,"Gastrojejunostomy (GJJ) and endoscopic stenting (ES) are palliative treatments for gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) caused by gastric cancer. We compared the outcomes of GJJ with ES by performing a meta-analysis. Clinical trials that compared GJJ with ES for the treatment of GOO in gastric cancer were included in the meta-analysis. Procedure time, time to resumption of oral intake, duration of hospital stay, patency duration, and overall survival days were compared using weighted mean differences (WMDs). Technical success, clinical success, procedure-related mortality, complications, the rate of re-obstruction, postoperative chemotherapy, and reintervention were compared using odds ratios (OR s). Nine studies were included in the analysis. Technical success and clinical success were not significantly different between the ES and GJJ groups. The ES group had a shorter procedure time (WMD = -80.89 min, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -93.99 to -67.78,P < 0.001), faster resumption of oral intake (WMD = -3.45 days, 95% CI = -5.25 to -1.65,P < 0.001), and shorter duration of hospital stay (WMD = -7.67 days, 95% CI = -11.02 to -4.33,P < 0.001). The rate of minor complications was significantly higher in the GJJ group (OR = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.04-0.40,P < 0.001). However, the rates of major complications (OR = 6.91, 95% CI = 3.90-12.25,P < 0.001), re-obstruction (OR= 7.75, 95% CI = 4.06-14.78,P < 0.001), and reintervention (OR= 6.27, 95% CI = 3.36-11.68,P < 0.001) were significantly lower in the GJJ group than that in the ES group. Moreover, GJJ was significantly associated with a longer patency duration (WMD = -167.16 days, 95% CI = -254.01 to -89.31,P < 0.001) and overall survival (WMD = -103.20 days, 95% CI = -161.49 to -44.91, P= 0.001). Both GJJ and ES are effective procedures for the treatment of GOO caused by gastric cancer. ES is associated with better short-term outcomes. GJJ is preferable to ES in terms of its lower rate of stent-related complications, re-obstruction, and reintervention. GJJ should be considered a treatment option for patients with a long life expectancy and good performance status.",10.4103/0366-6999.180530,,,,975
766,Adaptive changes in pancreas post Roux-en-Y gastric bypass induced weight loss.,"Obesity has been shown to trigger adaptive increases in pancreas parenchymal and fat volume. Consecutively, pancreatic steatosis may lead to beta-cell dysfunction. However, it is not known whether the pancreatic tissue components decrease with weight loss and pancreatic steatosis is reversible following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Therefore, the objective of the study was to investigate the effects of RYGB-induced weight loss on pancreatic volume and glucose homeostasis. Eleven patients were recruited in the Obesity Centre of the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf. Before and 6Â months after RYGB, total GLP-1 levels were measured during oral glucose tolerance test. To assess changes in visceral adipose tissue and pancreatic volume, MRI was performed. Measures of glucose homeostasis and insulin indices were assessed. Fractional beta-cell area was estimated by correlation with the C-peptide-to-glucose ratio; beta-cell mass was calculated by the product of beta-cell area and pancreas parenchymal weight. Pancreas volume decreased from 83.8 (75.7-92.0) to 70.5 (58.8-82.3) cm3 (mean [95% CI], PÂ =Â .001). The decrease in total volume was associated with a significant decrease in fat volume. Fasting insulin and C-peptide were lower post RYGB. HOMA-IR levels decreased, whereas insulin sensitivity increased (PÂ =Â .03). This was consistent with a reduction in the estimated beta-cell area and mass. Following RYGB, pancreatic volume and steatosis adaptively decreased to ""normal"" levels with accompanying improvement in glucose homeostasis. Moreover, obesity-driven beta-cell expansion seems to be reversible; however, future studies must define a method to more accurately estimate functional beta-cell mass to increase our understanding of glucose homeostasis after RYGB.",10.1002/dmrr.3025,,,,976
1136,"Predicting 90-day mortality after bariatric surgery: an independent, external validation of the OS-MRS prognostic risk score.","The Obesity Surgery Mortality Risk Score (OS-MRS) was developed using data from 1995 to 2004; it has yet to be validated for more recent patients in integrated delivery system settings. The objective of this study was to validate the OS-MRS using data from electronic health records in a distributed data network. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 3,817 adults who underwent an open (21.4%) or laparoscopic (78.6%) gastric bypass surgery between 2005 and 2007 in the Scalable Partnering Network. Our main outcome was all-cause mortality during the 90 days after surgery. We scored patients' risk of mortality by adding characteristics according to the OS-MRS (i.e., 1 point for each predictor). Sixteen of 3,817 (0.42/100; 95% CI, .24-.68) patients died within 90 days. The OS-MRS discriminated low-risk and high-risk patients effectively: low-risk (2 of 1,654 patients; .12 deaths/100 patients), intermediate-risk (10 of 2,008 patients; .50 deaths/100 patients), and high-risk (4 of 155 patients; 2.58 deaths/100 patients). High-risk patients were 21.3 times more likely to die in the first 90 days after surgery than low-risk patients (risk ratio = 21.3; 95% CI, 3.9-115.6). In these 10 U.S. healthcare delivery systems, the OS-MRS appears valid-albeit with the caveat that we observed a small number of deaths. The OS-MRS appears useful for identifying the small fraction of patients at high risk for 90-day mortality after open and laparoscopic RYGB.",10.1016/j.soard.2014.04.006,,,,977
290,The role of total alimentary limb length in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a systematic review.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is an established surgical treatment for obesity. Variations in limb length during RYGB procedures have been investigated for optimizing weight loss while minimizing nutritional deficiencies. The role of the total alimentary limb length (TALL; Roux limb plus common channel [CC]), however, is poorly defined. Compare TALL in RYGB procedures for weight loss outcomes and malnutrition. Systematic review. Ovid Medline and PubMed databases were searched for entries between 1993 and 2020. Search terms included ""gastric bypass"" and ""TALL."" Two independent reviewers screened the results. A total of 21 studies measured TALL in RYGB. Of these, 4 of 6 reported a relationship between TALL and weight loss. Additionally, 11 studies reported that when TALL was â‰¤400 cm and CC <200 cm, 3.4% to 63.6% of patients required limb lengthening for protein malnutrition. The majority of studies on RYGB do not report TALL length. There is some evidence that weight loss is affected by shortening TALL, while a TALL â‰¤400 cm with CC<200 should be avoided due to severe protein malnutrition. More studies on the effect of TALL are needed.",10.1016/j.soard.2021.08.022,,,,978
334,Management of gallstone disease prior to and after metabolic surgery: a single-center observational study.,"Rapid weight loss after bariatric surgery is a risk factor for gallstone formation. There are different strategies regarding its management in bariatric patients, including prophylactic cholecystectomy (CCE) in all patients, concomitant CCE only in symptomatic patients, or concomitant CCE in all patients with known gallstones. We present the safety and long-term results of the last concept. Retrospective single-center analysis of a prospective database on perioperative and long-term results of patients with laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) over a 15-year period. The minimal follow-up was 24 months. Concomitant CCE was intended for all patients with gallstones detected by preoperative sonography. Academic teaching hospital in Switzerland. After exclusion of patients with a history of CCE (11.5%), a total of 1174 patients (69.6% LRYGB, 30.4% LSG) were included in the final analysis. Preoperative gallbladder pathology was detected in 21.2% of patients, of whom 98.4%, or 20.9% of the total patients, received a concomitant CCE. The additional procedure prolonged the average operation time by 38 minutes (not significant) and did not increase the complication rate compared with bariatric procedure without CCE (3.7% versus 5.7%, P = .26). No complication was directly linked to the CCE. Postoperative symptomatic gallbladder disease was observed in 9.3% of patients (LRYGB 7.0% versus LSG 2.3%, P = .15), with 19.8% of those patients initially presenting with a complication. The concept of concomitant CCE in primary bariatric patients with gallstones was feasible and safe. Nevertheless, 9.3% of primary gallstone-free patients developed postoperative symptomatic gallbladder disease and required subsequent CCE despite routine ursodeoxycholic acid prophylaxis.",10.1016/j.soard.2021.10.006,,,,979
868,Risk of low birth weight and micronutrient deficiencies in neonates from mothers after gastric bypass: a case control study.,"An increased risk of small-for-gestational-age infants after maternal bariatric surgery has been shown. The risk of micronutrients deficiencies in these neonates is unclear. To screen for micronutrients deficiencies in newborns of mothers with gastric bypass. University hospital in Angers, France. This study compared the clinical and cord blood biological characteristics of 56 newborns of mothers with prior Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and 56 newborns of nonobese healthy mothers after normal pregnancy (controls), followed between January 3, 2008 and October 31, 2012. Cord blood micronutrients concentrations from controls were used for establishing normative data. After RYGB, the women took daily micronutrients supplements. RYGB mothers lost 18.1Â±6.3 kg/m2 of body mass index (BMI) in the 11-69 months between surgery and pregnancy onset (percentage of excess weight loss 79Â±20%), reaching BMI of 30.1Â±6.0 kg/m2 compared with 22.3Â±4.0 kg/m2 in the controls (P<.05). Neonates born to RYGB mothers were small-for-gestational-age in 23% of cases versus 3.6% in the control group (P<.01). A higher percentage of RYGB neonates had cord blood concentrations below the 2.5 percentile for calcium (19% versus 2%), zinc (13% versus 3%,), iron (19% versus 2%), and vitamin A (13% versus 3%), and over the 97.5 percentile for magnesium (13% versus 3%), vitamin E (16% versus 3%), 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (13% versus 2%), and vitamin B12 (14% versus 2%) (P<.05 for all comparisons). Neonates from RYGB mothers showed cord blood micronutrient differences compared with neonates from healthy mothers. The comparison with neonates from morbidly obese women is still to be done.",10.1016/j.soard.2017.03.017,,,,980
551,Rapid changes in neuroendocrine regulation may contribute to reversal of type 2 diabetes after gastric bypass surgery.,"To explore the role of hormones and the autonomic nervous system in the rapid remission of diabetes after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB). Nineteen obese patients with type 2 diabetes, 7 M/12 F, were randomized (2:1) to RYGB or standard-of-care medical treatment (control). At baseline and 4 and 24 weeks post surgery, fasting blood sampling, OGTT, intravenous arginine challenge, and heart-rate variability (HRV) assessments were performed. At both 4 and 24 weeks post-RYGB the following effects were found: arginine-stimulated insulin secretion was reduced. GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon rise during OGTT was enhanced. IGF-1 and GH levels increased. In addition, total HRV and spectral components PLF (power of low frequency) and PHF (power of high frequency) increased. At 4 weeks, morning cortisol was lower than baseline and 24 weeks. At 24 weeks, NEFA levels during OGTT, and the PLF/PHF ratio decreased. None of these changes were seen in the control group. There were rapid changes within 4 weeks after RYGB: signs of enhanced parasympathetic nerve activity, reduced morning cortisol, and enhanced incretin and glucagon responses to glucose. The findings suggest that neurohormonal mechanisms can contribute to the rapid improvement of insulin resistance and glycemia following RYGB in type 2 diabetes.",10.1007/s12020-020-02203-w,,,,981
77,Effects of medical and surgical treatment on vitamin D levels in obesity.,"Persons living with obesity treated with bariatric surgery are at a high risk of developing nutritional deficiencies. The primary aim of this observational cohort study was to compare vitamin D levels in patients two years after bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass/RYGB and sleeve gastrectomy/SG) with a very low-energy diet (VLED). The same subjects were also compared with a population sample from the same region at baseline. The primary hypothesis was that surgery, especially RYGB, would lead to an increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency compared to subjects treated with VLED. 971 individuals eligible for surgical, RYGB (n = 388), SG (n = 201), and medical treatment (n = 382), in routine care, were included consecutively between 2015 and 2017. A random population sample from the WHO-MONICA project was used as a reference, (n = 414). S-calcium, S-25(OH)D (vitamin D), and S-PTH (parathyroid hormone) were measured in all persons with obesity at baseline and two years after treatment (n = 713). Self-reported use of vitamin D and calcium supplementation was registered. Vitamin D deficiency (S-25(OH)D <25mmol/l) was found in 5.2% of the persons with obesity at baseline versus 1.7% of the general population (SMD>0.1). S-25(OH)D increased for all treatment groups but was higher in RYGB and SG (SMD>0.1, standardized mean difference). Thirteen subjects (1.8%) had vitamin D deficiency after obesity treatment. Surgical intervention for obesity followed by vitamin D supplementation was not associated with a higher risk for vitamin D deficiency, irrespective of surgery type, compared to individuals on medical treatment. However, persons living with obesity seeking weight loss treatment are more likely to have deficient vitamin D levels compared to the general population.",10.1371/journal.pone.0292780,,,,982
1547,Fentanyl or dexmedetomidine combined with desflurane for bariatric surgery.,"Because fentanyl has ventilatory depressing effects, alternative methods for analgesia may be beneficial for management of bariatric surgery. We evaluated whether dexmedetomidine infusion could replace fentanyl for facilitation of open gastric bypass surgery. Randomized, single blinded, open label. University teaching hospital. Twenty bariatric patients with an average body mass index of 54 to 61 kg/m2 undergoing surgery for open gastric bypass. Patients were randomized to receive either fentanyl (0.5-microg/kg bolus, 0.5 microg.kg(-1).h(-1), n = 10) or dexmedetomidine (0.5-microg/kg bolus, 0.4 microg.kg(-1).h(-1), n = 10) for intraoperative analgesia. In both groups, end-tidal desflurane was adjusted to maintain the bispectral index at 45 to 50. In the operating room, blood pressure and heart rate were measured at 5-minute intervals. Bispectral index and end-tidal desflurane concentration were measured every hour. During recovery in the postanesthesia care unit, patient-evaluated pain scores and morphine use by patient-controlled analgesia pump were determined. During surgery, desflurane concentrations necessary to maintain the bispectral index at 45 to 50 were decreased, and blood pressure and heart rate were lower with in the dexmedetomidine compared with fentanyl group. In the postanesthesia care unit, pain scores and morphine use were decreased in the dexmedetomidine group. Dexmedetomidine, when used to substitute for fentanyl during gastric bypass surgery, attenuates blood pressure and provides postoperative analgesia.",10.1016/j.jclinane.2005.05.009,,,,983
937,Costs of bariatric surgery in a randomised control trial (RCT) comparing Roux en Y gastric bypass vs sleeve gastrectomy in morbidly obese diabetic patients.,"To provide a longitudinal analysis of the direct healthcare costs of providing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) surgery service in the context of a randomised control trial (RCT) of obese patients with type 2 diabetes in Waitemata District Health Board, Auckland, New Zealand. The Waitemata District Health Board costing system was used to calculate costs in New Zealand Dollars (NZD) associated with all pre- and post-operative hospital clinic visits, peri-operative care, hospitalisations and medication costs up to one year after bariatric surgery. Healthcare costs of medications, laboratory investigations and hospital clinic visits for one year prior to enrolment into the RCT were also calculated. One hundred and fourteen patients were randomised to undergo laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG, n=58) or laparoscopic Roux en Y gastric bypass (LRYGB, n=56). Total costs one year pre-enrolment was $203,926 for all patients (mean $1,789 per patient). Total cost of surgery was $1,208,005 (mean $9,131 per LSG patient and mean $12,456 per LRYGB patient). Total cost one year post-operatively was $542,656 (mean $4,760 per patient). The total medication cost reduced from $118,993.72(mean $1,044 per patient) to $31,304.93 (mean $274.60 per patient), p<0.005. The largest cost reduction was seen with annual diabetic medications reducing from $110,115.78(mean $965.93 per patient) to $7,237.85 (mean $63.48 per patient), p<0.005. Among patients with type 2 diabetes and morbid obesity undergoing LSG and LRYGB, health service costs were greater in the year after surgery than in the year before, although prescription costs were lower post-operatively. There was no significant difference in reduction in prescription cost by surgical procedure at 12 months. However, the LRYGB surgery was more expensive than LSG, primarily because of the longer operative time required.",,,,,984
1040,The Influence of Bariatric Surgery on Serum Bile Acids in Humans and Potential Metabolic and Hormonal Implications: a Systematic Review.,"Recent research suggests a mechanistic role for bile acids (BA) in the metabolic improvement following bariatric surgery. It is believed that the hormonal and metabolic effects associated with changes in systemic BAs may be related to the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and a G-protein coupled receptor (TGR5). This systematic review examines changes in systemic BAs following bariatric procedures. Studies were included if they reported the measurement of systemic BAs in humans at at least one time point after bariatric surgery. Eleven papers were identified that met the inclusion criteria. Seven studies reported the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on fasting BAs. The majority (6/7) reported that fasting BAs increased after RYGB. Data regarding fasting BAs after vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) and laparoscopic gastric banding (LAGB) are inconsistent. Data regarding post-prandial BA changes after RYGB, VSG, and LAGB are also inconsistent. More research is needed to investigate the connection between BAs and the metabolic improvement seen after bariatric surgery.",10.1007/s13679-015-0171-x,,,,985
1495,[Laparoscopic reoperations after gastric banding for alimentary--constitutional obesity].,"There were the literature data studied up and the results of own observations summarized about the patients after laparoscopic gastric banding and laparoscopic reoperations after gastric banding interventions in 72 persons, suffering obesity. Two procedures were used for gastric banding operation: in 1992-1999 yrs a ""small"" stomach was formed 50-100 ml in volume, the diameter of stenosed segment had constituted 10-11 mm, the ring was placed through the omental bursa; from 1999 yr--suprabursal placement of the bandage and formation of a ""small"" stomach 20-25 ml in volu me. In the immediate and late follow-up period the body mass was reducing adequately in up to 80% of the patients. The complications in the early postoperative period, demanding reoperation, had occurred in 4 (5.5%) of patients and in the late period--in 6 (8.3%). All of them laparoscopic reoperation was conducted. We consider, that in occurrence of early and late postoperative complications their correction is mandatory using laparoscopic technologies.",,,,,986
761,Efficacy of oral compared with intramuscular vitamin B-12 supplementation after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a randomized controlled trial.,"After Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), patients often develop a vitamin B-12 deficiency. Our objective was to investigate whether oral supplementation increases and normalizes low vitamin B-12 concentrations (vitamin B-12Â >Â 200 pmol/L) in RYGB patients as compared to intramuscular injections. A randomized controlled trial in RYGB patients with subnormal serum B-12 concentrations was performed. One group (IM B-12) received bimonthly intramuscular hydroxocobalamin injections (2000 Âµg as loading dose and 1000 Âµg at follow-up) for 6 mo. The second group (oral B-12) received daily doses of oral methylcobalamin (1000 Âµg). Serum vitamin B-12 was determined at baseline (T0) and at 2 (T1), 4 (T2), and 6 mo (T3) after start of treatment. Concentrations of the secondary markers methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (Hcy) were measured at T0 and T3. Fifty patients were included and randomized, 27 in IM B-12 and 23 in oral B-12. The median vitamin B-12 concentration at T0 was 175 pmol/L (range: 114-196 pmol/L) for IM B-12 and 167 pmol/L (range: 129-199 pmol/L) for oral B-12. Vitamin B-12 normalized in all individuals, and there was no significant difference in vitamin B-12 between the two groups. MMA and Hcy concentrations decreased significantly after 6 mo within each group (PÂ <Â 0.001 and PÂ <Â 0.001 for MMA and PÂ =Â 0.03 and PÂ =Â 0.045 for Hcy, respectively). There was no significant difference between the groups at 6 mo for both MMA and Hcy (PÂ =Â 0.53 and PÂ =Â 0.79). The efficacy of oral vitamin B-12 supplementation was similar to that of hydroxocobalamin injections in the present study. Oral supplementation can be used as an alternative to hydroxocobalamin injections to treat RYGB patients with low values of serum vitamin B-12. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02270749.",10.1093/ajcn/nqy072,,,,987
434,Effects of Resistance Training With or Without Protein Supplementation on Body Composition and Resting Energy Expenditure in Patients 2-7Â Years PostRoux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: a Controlled Clinical Trial.,"Resistance training (RT) and adequate protein intake are recommended as strategies to preserve fat-free mass (FFM) and resting metabolic demand after bariatric surgery. However, the effect of both interventions combined in the late postoperative period is unclear. This study investigated the effects of RT, isolated and combined with protein supplementation, on body composition and resting energy expenditure (REE) in the late postoperative period of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). This controlled trial involved patients who were 2-7Â years postRYGB. Participants were partially matched on body mass index (BMI), age, sex, and years after surgery, and divided into four groups, placebo maltodextrin (control [CON]; nâ€‰=â€‰17), whey protein supplementation (PRO; nâ€‰=â€‰18), RT combined with placebo (RTP; nâ€‰=â€‰13), and RT combined with whey protein supplementation (RTPâ€‰+â€‰PRO; nâ€‰=â€‰15)-considering the participants who completed the protocol. REE was measured by indirect calorimetry and body composition by multifrequency electrical bioimpedance. Participant characteristics (40.3â€‰Â±â€‰8.3Â years old; average BMI 29.7â€‰Â±â€‰5.3Â kg/m2; 88.9% females) were similar among groups. The RTP+PRO group showed an increase of 1.46â€‰Â±â€‰1.02Â kg in FFM and 0.91â€‰Â±â€‰0.64Â kg in skeletal muscle mass (SMM), which was greater than the equivalent values in the CON group (-â€‰0.24â€‰Â±â€‰1.64Â kg, pâ€‰=â€‰0.006 and -â€‰0.08â€‰Â±â€‰0.96Â kg, pâ€‰=â€‰0.008, respectively). There was no significant time-by-group interaction for absolute or relative REE. Combined RT and adequate protein intake via supplementation can increase FFM and SMM in the late postoperative period without changing REE. These associated strategies were effective in improving muscle-related parameters and potentially in improving the patients' physical function.",10.1007/s11695-020-05172-1,,,,988
915,Failure of the Obesity Surgery Mortality Risk Score (OS-MRS) to Predict Postoperative Complications After Bariatric Surgery. A Single-Center Series and Systematic Review.,"The obesity surgery mortality risk score (OS-MRS) was developed to determine the risk of postoperative mortality in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The aim of the present study is to assess the utility of this score for preventing the risk of postoperative complications from bariatric surgery. Prospective study of 321 patients undergoing bariatric surgery to whom the OS-MRS was applied. Postoperative complications were classified according to the Clavien-Dindo system. The relation between the OS-MRS and the appearance of complications and mortality was analyzed. A Medline/Embase search was conducted using bariatric surgery, mortality, and complications as key words. Studies using the OS-MRS to predict morbidity and mortality were included. Of the 321 patients, 303 (94.3%) underwent gastric bypass and the remaining 18 (5.6%) a sleeve gastrectomy. The OS-MRS classified 178 patients as class A (55.5%), 129 as class B (40.2%), and 14 as class C (4.4%). According to the Clavien-Dindo system, 10.4% of the complications were â‰¥III. There was one death (class B). No significant association was found between the OS-MRS and the rate of complications. In our study, the OS-MRS is not correlated with the appearance of early complications or mortality. Future studies must focus on systems for predicting the appearance and severity of postoperative complications classified according to the Clavien-Dindo system, and not only on mortality.",10.1007/s11695-016-2506-4,,,,989
898,Patterns of Abnormal Gastric Pacemaking After Sleeve Gastrectomy Defined by Laparoscopic High-Resolution Electrical Mapping.,"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is increasingly being applied to treat obesity. LSG includes excision of the normal gastric pacemaker, which could induce electrical dysrhythmias impacting on post-operative symptoms and recovery, but these implications have not been adequately investigated. This study aimed to define the effects of LSG on gastric slow-wave pacemaking using laparoscopic high-resolution (HR) electrical mapping. Laparoscopic HR mapping was performed before and after LSG using flexible printed circuit arrays (64-96 electrodes; 8-12Â cm2; nÂ =Â 8 patients) deployed through a 12Â mm trocar and positioned on the gastric serosa. An additional patient with chronic reflux, nausea, and dysmotility 6Â months after LSG also underwent gastric mapping while undergoing conversion to gastric bypass. Slow-wave activity was quantified by propagation pattern, frequency, velocity, and amplitude. Baseline activity showed exclusively normal propagation. Acutely after LSG, all patients developed either a distal unifocal ectopic pacemaker with retrograde propagation (50%) or bioelectrical quiescence (50%). Propagation velocity was abnormally rapid after LSG (12.5Â Â±Â 0.8 vs baseline 3.8Â Â±Â 0.8Â mmÂ s-1; pÂ =Â 0.01), whereas frequency and amplitude were unchanged (2.7Â Â±Â 0.3 vs 2.8Â Â±Â 0.3Â cpm, pÂ =Â 0.7; 1.7Â Â±Â 0.2 vs 1.6Â Â±Â 0.6Â mV, pÂ =Â 0.7). In the patient with chronic dysmotility after LSG, mapping also revealed a stable antral ectopic pacemaker with retrograde rapid propagation (12.6Â Â±Â 4.8Â mmÂ s-1). Resection of the gastric pacemaker during LSG acutely resulted in aberrant distal ectopic pacemaking or bioelectrical quiescence. Ectopic pacemaking can persist long after LSG, inducing chronic dysmotility. The clinical and therapeutic significance of these findings now require further investigation.",10.1007/s11695-017-2597-6,,,,990
1330,"Metabolic and hormonal changes after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy: a randomized, prospective trial.","The mechanisms of amelioration of glycemic control early after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) are not fully understood. In this prospective, randomized 1-year trial, outcomes of LRYGB and LSG patients were compared, focusing on possibly responsible mechanisms. Twelve patients were randomized to LRYGB and 11 to LSG. These non-diabetic patients were investigated before and 1 week, 3 months, and 12 months after surgery. A standard test meal was given after an overnight fast, and blood samples were collected before, during, and after food intake for hormone profiles (cholecystokinin (CCK), ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY)). In both groups, body weight and BMI decreased markedly and comparably leading to an identical improvement of abnormal glycemic control (HOMA index). Post-surgery, patients had markedly increased postprandial plasma GLP-1 and PYY levels (p < 0.05) with ensuing improvement in glucose homeostasis. At 12 months, LRYGB ghrelin levels approached preoperative values. The postprandial, physiologic fluctuation returned, however, while LSG ghrelin levels were still markedly attenuated. One year postoperatively, CCK concentrations after test meals increased less in the LRYGB group than they did in the LSG group, with the latter showing significantly higher maximal CCK concentrations (p < 0.012 vs. LRYGB). Bypassing the foregut is not the only mechanism responsible for improved glucose homeostasis. The balance between foregut (ghrelin, CCK) and hindgut (GLP-1, PYY) hormones is a key to understanding the underlying mechanisms.",10.1007/s11695-012-0622-3,,,,991
824,Effect of meal size and texture on gastric pouch emptying and glucagon-like peptide 1 after gastric bypass surgery.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) accelerates gastric pouch emptying, enhances postprandial glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and insulin, and lowers glucose concentrations. To prevent discomfort and reactive hypoglycemia, it is recommended that post-RYGB patients eat small, frequent meals and avoid caloric drinks. However, the effect of meal size and texture on GLP-1 and metabolic response has not been studied. To demonstrate that frequent minimeals and solid meals (S) elicit less GLP-1 and insulin release and less reactive hypoglycemia and are better tolerated compared with a single isocaloric liquid meal (L). A university hospital. In this prospective study, 32 RYGB candidates were enrolled and randomized to L or S groups before gastric bypass. Each subject received an L or S 600-kcal single meal (SM) administered at hour 0 or three 200-kcal minimeals administered at hours 0, 2, and 4 on 2 separate days. Twenty-one patients were retested 1 year after RYGB. Blood and visual analogue scale measurements were collected up to 6 hours postprandially. Outcome measures included gastric pouch emptying, glucose, insulin, and GLP-1; hunger, fullness, and stomach discomfort were measured by visual analogue scale. Twenty-one were patients retested after RYGB (L: n = 12; S: n = 9). Meal texture had a significant effect on peak GLP-1 (L-SM: 106.1 Â± 67.2 versus S-SM: 45.3 Â± 25.2 pM, P = .004), peak insulin, and postprandial glucose. Hypoglycemia was more frequent after the L-SM meal compared with the S-SM. Gastric pouch emptying was 2.4 times faster after RYGB but was not affected by texture. Meal texture and size have significant impact on tolerance and metabolic response after RYGB.",10.1016/j.soard.2017.09.004,,,,992
91,Metabolite signature of diabetes remission in individuals with obesity undergoing weight loss interventions.,"This observational study investigated metabolomic changes in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) after weight loss. We hypothesized that metabolite changes associated with T2D-relevant phenotypes are signatures of improved health. Fasting plasma samples from individuals undergoing bariatric surgery (nâ€‰=â€‰71 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [RYGB], nâ€‰=â€‰22 gastric banding), lifestyle intervention (nâ€‰=â€‰66), or usual care (nâ€‰=â€‰14) were profiled for 139 metabolites before and 2â€‰years after weight loss. Principal component analysis grouped correlated metabolites into factors. Association of preintervention metabolites was tested with preintervention clinical features and changes in T2D markers. Association between change in metabolites/metabolite factors and change in T2D remission markers, homeostasis model assessment of Î²-cell function, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was assessed. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) were associated with preintervention adiposity. Changes in BCAAs (valine, leucine/isoleucine) and branched-chain ketoacids were positively associated with change in HbA1c (false discovery rate q valueâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.001) that persisted after adjustment for percentage weight change and RYGB (pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.02). In analyses stratified by RYGB or other weight loss method, some metabolites showed association with non-RYGB weight loss. This study confirmed known metabolite associations with obesity/T2D and showed an association of BCAAs with HbA1c change after weight loss, independent of the method or magnitude of weight loss.",10.1002/oby.23943,,,,993
1161,"Supplemental postoperative oxygen does not reduce surgical site infection and major healing-related complications from bariatric surgery in morbidly obese patients: a randomized, blinded trial.","Morbidly obese patients are at high risk for perioperative complications, including surgical site infections. Baseline arterial oxygenation is low in the morbidly obese, leading to low tissue oxygenation, which in turn is a primary determinant of infection risk. We therefore tested the hypothesis that extending intraoperative supplemental oxygen 12 to 16 hours into the postoperative period reduces the risk of surgical site infection and healing-related complications. Morbidly obese patients having open or laparoscopic bariatric surgery were given 80% inspired oxygen intraoperatively. Postoperatively, patients were randomly assigned to either 2 L/min of oxygen via nasal cannula or approximately 80% supplemental inspired oxygen after tracheal extubation until the first postoperative morning. The risks of surgical site infection and of major healing-related complications were evaluated 60 days after surgery. In a preplanned interim analysis based on the initial 400 patients, the overall observed incidence of the collapsed composite of major complications was 13.3%; the observed incidence of components of the composite outcome ranged from 0% (peritonitis) to 8.5% (surgical wound infection). The estimated relative risk of any â‰¥1 major complications occurring within the first 60 days after surgery, adjusting for study site, was 0.94 (95% confidence interval, 0.52-1.68) (P = 0.80, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel). The Executive Committee thus stopped the trial for futility. Supplemental postoperative oxygen does not reduce the risk of surgical site infection rate and healing-related postoperative complications in patients having gastric bypass surgery.",10.1213/ANE.0000000000000318,,,,994
619,Short-term improvements in cognitive function following vertical sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en Y gastric bypass: a direct comparison study.,"Cognitive deficits are observed in individuals with obesity. While bariatric surgery can reverse these deficits, it remains unclear whether surgery type differentially influences cognitive outcome. We compared the extent to which vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) and Roux-en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) ameliorated cognitive impairments associated with obesity. Female participants approved for VSG (Nâ€‰=â€‰18) or RYGB (Nâ€‰=â€‰18) were administered cognitive measures spanning the domains of attention [Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) Trial 1 and Letter Number Sequencing], processing speed [Stroop Color Trial, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, and Trail Making Part A], memory [HVLT Retained and HVLT Discrimination Index], and executive functioning (Stroop Color Word Trials and Trail Making Part B-A) prior to surgery and at 2Â weeks and 3Â months following surgery. Scores for each cognitive domain were calculated and compared between surgical cohorts using repeated measures analyses of variance. Significant weight loss was observed 2Â weeks and 3Â months following RYGB and VSG and was accompanied by improvements in processing speed and executive functioning. Patients who received RYGB also experienced improved attention as early as 2Â weeks, which persisted at 3Â months. This was not observed in individuals who underwent VSG. No changes in memory were observed from baseline measures in either group. This is the first report of cognitive improvements following VSG and the first direct comparison of cognitive improvements following RYGB and VSG. Short-term improvements in specific domains of cognitive function are observed at the beginning of the active weight loss phase following bariatric surgery that persisted to 3Â months. The anatomical distinction between the two surgeries and resulting differential metabolic profiles may be responsible for the improvements in attention observed following RYGB but not following VSG.",10.1007/s00464-019-07015-2,,,,995
70,Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of the Effects of Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy on Dyslipidemia.,"The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the effects of LRYGB and LSG on dyslipidemia. Studies comparing the effects of LRYGB and LSG on dyslipidemia with follow-up of 12 months or more were included. Twenty-four studies comprising seven RCTs and 17 comparative observational studies were included. Meta-analysis of RCTs (n=487) showed that improvement/resolution of dyslipidemia was better after LRYGB (68.5%, n=161/235) compared to LSG (48.4%, n=122/252). Patients undergoing LRYGB were more than twice as likely to experience improvement/resolution in dyslipidemia compared to those undergoing LSG (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.21-4.29, p=0.010). Both LRGYB and LSG appears effective in improving dyslipidemia at >12 months after surgery; however, this improvement is more than twice higher after LRYGB compared to LSG.",10.1007/s11695-023-07022-2,,,,996
1621,Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism using two different doses of low-molecular-weight heparin (nadroparin) in bariatric surgery: a prospective randomized trial.,"Obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery are at a high risk of developing fatal pulmonary embolism or post-thrombotic syndrome. The prophylactic use of low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) is correlated with a significant reduction in post-operative venous thrombosis in patients undergoing orthopedic or general surgery. In morbidity obese patients, the limited number of comparative trials are too sparse to allow a consensus on the effective dose and dosing schedule. In a prospective study to evaluate the effect of two doses of nadroparin as prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism following bariatric surgery, 60 consecutive patients undergoing Rouxen-Y gastric bypass were randomized to receive either 0.6 ml (5700 IU) or 1.0 ml (9500 IU) of nadroparin started pre-operatively and then given once daily post-operatively until discharge. No statistically significant differences between the two groups were detected in any of the measured coagulation parameters either preoperatively or at days 1,3 and 5 postoperatively. No thrombotic events were observed pre- or post-operatively, and no patient developed meta-thrombotic syndrome at the 3 and 6 months follow-up. No bleeding events occurred in the patients given the lower dose compared with two major hemorrhages in those given the higher dose. Our results indicate that 0.6 ml (5700 IU) of nadroparin once daily is safe and well-tolerated, and it is as effective in prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism as the higher dose of 1 ml (9500 IU), in such high risk patients.",10.1381/09608920160558588,,,,997
1078,Systematic review and meta-analysis of single-balloon enteroscopy-assisted ERCP in patients with surgically altered GI anatomy.,"Surgically altered pancreaticobiliary anatomy increases the difficulty of performing ERCP. Single-balloon enteroscopy (SBE) is a relatively new technique that can be used for ERCP in patients with surgically altered anatomy. To evaluate the therapeutic and diagnostic success of SBE-ERCP among patients with surgically altered anatomy. Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies involving SBE-ERCP in patients with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, hepaticojejunostomy, or Whipple procedure. Enteroscopy success was defined as success in reaching the papilla and/or biliary anastomosis by using SBE. Diagnostic success was defined as obtaining a cholangiogram. Procedural success was defined as the ability to provide successful intervention, if appropriate. A random-effects model was used. A total of 461 patients underwent SBE-ERCP from 15 trials. The pooled enteroscopy, diagnostic, and procedural success rates were 80.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 75.3%-86.4%), 69.4% (95% CI, 61.0%-77.9%), and 61.7% (95% CI, 52.9%-70.5%), respectively. There was statistical large heterogeneity for enteroscopy, diagnostic, and therapeutic success (PÂ < .001 for all). Adverse events occurred in 6.5% (95% CI, 4.7%-9.1%) of patients. There was no evidence of publication bias in this meta-analysis. Our findings and interpretations are limited by the quantity and heterogeneity of the studies included in the analysis. SBE-ERCP has high diagnostic and procedural success rates in this challenging patient population. It should be considered a first-line intervention when biliary access is required after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, hepaticojejunostomy, or Whipple procedure.",10.1016/j.gie.2015.02.013,,,,998
708,Effect of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy on fasting gastrointestinal and pancreatic peptide hormones: A prospective nonrandomized trial.,"Changes in gastrointestinal and pancreatic hormones may play a role in promoting long-term weightÂ reduction andÂ improvedÂ glucose metabolism after sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. However, few studies have examined the metabolic and endocrine effects of these procedures in Mainland China. To compare the effects of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) on gastrointestinal and pancreatic peptide hormones. University hospital, China. A nonrandomized prospective study was conducted in Chinese obese patients undergoing LSG or LRYGB. Of 20 patients in this study, 10 underwent LSG, and 10 underwent LRYGB. Fasting plasma levels of insulin, glucagon, ghrelin, gastric inhibitory peptide, peptide YY, glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1, and GLP-2 were measured preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02963662). During the first year after both operations, mean body mass index and fasting insulin levels steadily decreased at all intervals. Fasting plasma glucose levels significantly decreased at 1 month after surgery, then remained stable in both groups. Glucagon levels significantly decreased at 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery in both groups, but returned to baseline at 12 months. Fasting GLP-1 and peptide YY significantly increased in both groups, but more so after LRYGB. However, GLP-2 did not change in either group. Ghrelin levels significantly decreased after LSG, but not after LRYGB. Gastric inhibitory peptide levels decreased after LRYGB but not after LSG. LSG and LRYGB resulted in significant and distinct changes in multiple gastrointestinal and pancreatic peptide hormones that are important regulators of obesity and metabolic health.",10.1016/j.soard.2018.06.003,,,,999
788,Efficacy of Postoperative Upper Gastrointestinal Series (UGI) and Computed Tomography (CT) Scan in Bariatric Surgery: a Meta-analysis on 7516 Patients.,"To demonstrate the lack of utility and efficacy of routine early postoperative upper gastrointestinal study (UGI) in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery and to show the higher efficacy of CT scan in cases of clinical suspicion of a leakage, a meta-analysis was performed. A literature search including articles published in last 18Â years was performed. For both UGI and CT scan, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. A first analysis considered overall patients, and a second analysis considered only symptomatic patients. Starting from 1233 eligible citations, 18 articles, including 7516 patients, were left. The pooled sensitivity was 54% for UGI (95% CI 34-74) with a high heterogeneity (I2Â =â€‰99.8%, pâ€‰<â€‰.001), whereas CT scan showed a pooled sensitivity of 91% (95% CI 89-93) significantly higher than sensitivity of UGI series (pâ€‰<â€‰0.01), with a high heterogeneity (I2Â =â€‰98.9%, pâ€‰<â€‰.001). In symptomatic patients the pooled sensitivity of UGI series was significantly lower than sensitivity of CT scan [49% (95% CI 31-68) vs 94% (95% CI 92-96), pâ€‰<â€‰0.01]. PPV showed a significant difference between UGI series and CT scan (54 vs 100%, pâ€‰<â€‰0.01). Specificity for UGI series was 98.6%, and specificity for CT scan was 99.7% (pâ€‰=â€‰ns); the mean NPV was 96 and 98% for UGI series and CT scan (pâ€‰=â€‰ns). According to our results, a CT scan triggered by clinical suspicion must be considered the first-line procedure to detect a postoperative leak following primary sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.",10.1007/s11695-018-3172-5,,,,1000
765,The anorexigenic peptide neurotensin relates to insulin sensitivity in obese patients after BPD or RYGB metabolic surgery.,"Neurotensin is a peptide with effects on appetite and intestinal lipid absorption. Experimental data suggest a role in glucose homeostasis, while human data is missing. Here, 20 morbidly obese subjects either underwent biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD), or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in a randomized fashion. Before and 1 year after surgery, anthropometric data, body composition, clinical biochemistry, insulin sensitivity by means of euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps (HEC) and fasting plasma proneurotensin 1-117 were analyzed. Plasma proneurotensin increased significantly more 1 year after BDP than RYGB (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.028), while weight loss was comparable. After metabolic surgery, proneurotensin correlated positively with insulin sensitivity (M-value) (râ€‰=â€‰0.55, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), while an inverse relationship with fasting glucose, HOMA-IR and HbA1c was observed (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 for all components). After adjustment for age and gender, proneurotensin and BMI remained independently related with delta of M-value (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.46 and Î²â€‰=â€‰0.51, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05, resp.). From these data we conclude that proneurotensin positively correlates with insulin sensitivity uniquely after weight loss induced by metabolic surgery in humans. BDP leads to a stronger increase in the anorexigenic peptide compared to RYGB.",10.1038/s41366-018-0084-3,,,,1001
1135,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, but not calorie restriction, reduces plasma branched-chain amino acids in obese women independent of weight loss or the presence of type 2 diabetes.","Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have been associated with increased levels of circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) that may be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. However, weight loss has not been consistently associated with the reduction of BCAA levels. We included 30 obese normal glucose-tolerant (NGT) subjects, 32 obese subjects with T2DM, and 12 lean female subjects. Obese subjects underwent either a restrictive procedure (gastric banding [GB], a very low-calorie diet [VLCD]), or a restrictive/bypass procedure (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [RYGB] surgery). Fasting blood samples were taken for the determination of amine group containing metabolites 4 weeks before, as well as 3 weeks and 3 months after the intervention. BCAA levels were higher in T2DM subjects, but not in NGT subjects, compared with lean subjects. Principal component (PC) analysis revealed a concise PC consisting of all BCAAs, which showed a correlation with measures of insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Only after the RYGB procedure, and at both 3 weeks and 3 months, were circulating BCAA levels reduced. Our data confirm an association between deregulation of BCAA metabolism in plasma and insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Three weeks after undergoing RYGB surgery, a significant decrease in BCAAs in both NGT as well as T2DM subjects was observed. After 3 months, despite inducing significant weight loss, neither GB nor VLCD induced a reduction in BCAA levels. Our results indicate that the bypass procedure of RYGB surgery, independent of weight loss or the presence of T2DM, reduces BCAA levels in obese subjects.",10.2337/dc14-0195,,,,1002
513,Change in predicted 10-year and lifetime cardiovascular disease risk after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Long-term changes in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk after bariatric surgery are not well characterized. To report sex-specific changes in CVD risk after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB). Observational cohort study at ten hospitals throughout the United States. Between 2006 and 2009, 1770 adults enrolled in a prospective cohort study underwent RYGB at 1 of 10 U.S. hospitals. Research assessments were conducted presurgery and annually postsurgery over 7 years. Sex specific-predicted 10-year and lifetime CVD risk were calculated using the Framingham10-year and lifetime risk scores, Framingham-body mass index, and atherosclerotic CVD scoring algorithms among participants with no history of CVD. Of 1566 eligible participants, 1234 (75.9%) with CVD risk determination pre- and postsurgery were included (1013 females, 221 males). Based on the Framingham10-year and lifetime risk scores, the percentage of females with predicted high (>20%) 10-year CVD risk declined from presurgery (6.5% [95% confidence interval: 6.7-7.5]) to 1 year postsurgery (1.0% [95% confidence interval: .8-1.2]; P < .001), then increased 1 to 7 years postsurgery (to 2.8% [95% confidence interval: 1.6-3.3]; P = .003), but was lower 7 years postsurgery versus presurgery (P < .001). Time trends for percentage of high-risk participants and mean CVD risk scores were similar for both sexes and other evaluated CVD risk scores. For example, among males mean lifetime atherosclerotic CVD score declined from presurgery to 1 year postsurgery, then increased 1 to 7 years postsurgery. However, there was a net decline from presurgery (P < .001). Among both females and males, predicted 10-year and lifetime CVD risk was substantially lower 7 years post RYGB than presurgery, suggesting RYGB surgery can lead to sustained improvements in short- and long-term CVD risk.",10.1016/j.soard.2020.04.011,,,,1003
185,Efficacy & safety of EUS-directed transgastric endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (EDGE) in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass anatomy: a systematic review & meta-analysis.,"In patients with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) anatomy, laparoscopic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (LA-ERCP) and enteroscopy-assisted ERCP (E-ERCP) have been utilized to achieve pancreaticobiliary access. Endoscopic ultrasound-directed transgastric endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (EDGE) has recently emerged as an alternate and efficient approach. As data regarding EDGE continues to evolve, concerns about safety and efficacy remain, limiting wide adoptability. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the safety and efficacy of EDGE and compare it to the current standard of care. A comprehensive search of major databases (inception to Nov 2022) identified published studies on EDGE. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled rates and heterogeneity (I2). Risk ratio (RR) and standardized difference in means (SMD) were utilized for head-to-head comparison analysis between EDGE vs. LA-ERCP and EDGE vs. E-ERCP. Primary outcomes assessed pooled EDGE safety (adverse events) and efficacy (technical/clinical success). Secondary outcomes assessed efficacy and safety profiles via a comparative analysis of EDGE vs. LA-ERCP and EDGE vs. E-ERCP. A total of 16 studies (470 patients) were included. EDGE pooled technical success (TS) rate was 96%Â (95% CI 92-97.6, I2â€‰=â€‰0), and clinical success was 91% (85-95, I2â€‰=â€‰0). Pooled rate of all adverse events with EDGE was 17% (14-24.6, I2â€‰=â€‰32%). On sub-group analysis, these included failure of fistula closure 17% (10-25.5, I2â€‰=â€‰48%), stent migration 7% (4-12, I2â€‰=â€‰51%), bleeding 5% (3.2-7.9, I2â€‰=â€‰0), post-EDGE weight gain 4% (2-9, I2â€‰=â€‰0), perforation 4% (2.1-5.8, I2â€‰=â€‰0), and post-ERCP pancreatitis 2% (1-5, I2â€‰=â€‰0). EDGE TS was comparable to LA-ERCP (97% vs. 98%; RR, 1.00; CI, 0.85-1.17,Â pâ€‰=â€‰0.95)Â and E-ERCP (100%Â vs. 66%; RR, 1.26; CI, 0.99-1.6,Â pâ€‰=â€‰0.06).Â No statistical difference was noted in adverse events between EDGE and LA-ERCP (13% vs. 17.6%; RR, 0.61; CI, 0.28-1.35,Â pâ€‰=â€‰0.52) and E-ERCP (9.6%Â vs. 16%; RR, 0.61; CI, 0.28-1.35,Â pâ€‰=â€‰0.22). EDGE procedure time and hospital stay were shorter than LA-ERCP and E-ERCP (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Our analysis shows that EDGE is safe and efficacious to the current standard of care. Further head-to-head comparative trials are needed to validate our findings.",10.1007/s00464-023-09926-7,,,,1004
605,Changes in oxidative stress markers and cardiometabolic risk factors among Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients after 3- and 12-months postsurgery follow-up.,"Evidence shows potential reduction in oxidative stress after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. However, this outcome can vary, with postsurgery time, type of markers significantly altered, and possible relation with cardiometabolic risk markers, thus indicating the need for more studies. To evaluate changes in oxidative stress and its relation with cardiometabolic risk markers in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients after 3 and 12 months postsurgery. Federal University of ViÃ§osa, Brazil. All data were collected before surgery and after 3 and 12 months postsurgery. Biochemical data were collected, and insulin resistance was determined by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, triglyceride/glucose index, and triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Additionally, catalase, superoxide dismutase, ferric-reducing antioxidant power, nitric oxide, carbonylated protein, and malondialdehyde were analyzed. After 3 months postsurgery, excess weight loss was 46%. It increased to 82% after 12 months. We observed a significant reduction in levels of serum insulin, triglycerides, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, triglyceride/glucose index, and triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol indices and nitric oxide, throughout the entire study period. Also, reduced levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, serum glucose, malondialdehyde, and superoxide dismutase were observed at 3 and 12 months postsurgery compared with baseline. On the other hand, reduction in ferric-reducing antioxidant power occurred only at 3 months postsurgery. We also observed that nitric oxide was positively correlated with triglycerides, percent excess weight loss, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride/glucose index. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is able to reduce oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and improve lipid profile after 3 and 12 months postsurgery. Furthermore, changes in oxidative stressÂ and cardiometabolic risk markers are correlated.",10.1016/j.soard.2019.07.014,,,,1005
636,Changes in Bone Marrow Adipose Tissue One Year After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: A Prospective Cohort Study.,"Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) has been postulated to mediate skeletal fragility in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) induces a substantial weight loss and resolution of comorbidities. However, the procedure induces increased bone turnover and fracture rates. No previous study has evaluated biopsy-measured BMAT fraction preoperatively and after RYGB. In this study, we aimed to investigate BMAT fraction of the hip in participants with and without T2D preoperatively and 1 year after RYGB and explore factors associated with BMAT change. Patients with morbid obesity scheduled for RYGB were examined preoperatively and 1 year after RYGB. Forty-four participants were included and preoperative examinations were possible in 35. Of these, 33 (94%) met for follow-up, 2 were excluded, and BMAT estimation was not possible in 1. Eighteen (60%) of the participants were females and 11 (37%) had T2D. Preoperative BMAT fraction was positively associated with glycosylated hemoglobin and negatively associated with areal bone mineral density (aBMD). After RYGB, BMAT fraction decreased from 40.4â€‰Â±â€‰1.7% to 35.6â€‰Â±â€‰12.8%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.042, or with mean percent change of 10.7% of preoperative BMAT fraction. Change in BMAT fraction was positively associated with change in body mass index (BMI) and total body fat. In females, we observed a mean percent reduction of 22.4â€‰Â±â€‰19.6%, whereas in males BMAT increased with a mean percent of 6.8â€‰Â±â€‰37.5%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.009. For males, changes in estradiol were associated with BMAT change; this was not observed for females. In participants with and without T2D, the mean percent BMAT reduction was 5.8â€‰Â±â€‰36.9% and 13.5â€‰Â±â€‰28.0%, respectively, pâ€‰=â€‰0.52. We conclude that a high BMAT seems to be associated with lower aBMD and poorer glycemic control in obese subjects. After RYGB, we observed a significant decrease in BMAT. The reduction in BMAT did not differ between participants with and without T2D, but appeared sex specific. Â© 2019 The Authors.

865,Comparison of oral antibiotic failure rates in post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients versus controls.,"Due to the malabsorptive nature of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), there is a potential for impaired absorption of oral medications. Clinical outcomes of patients who receive oral antibiotics after RYGB have not been adequately described in the literature. The primary objective was composite therapeutic failure. Secondary objectives included comparing failure rates between antibiotic classes and at various time points since RYGB. University hospital, United States. Patients with a history of RYGB and controls who received an eligible oral antibiotic for urinary tract infection, skin and soft tissue infection, or community acquired pneumonia between April 1, 2008, and September 30, 2015, were included via retrospective chart review. Therapeutic failure rates between groups were compared and adjusted for body mass index and infection type. Failure rates among antibiotic classes and various time points since RYGB (0-1 yr, 1-1.9 yr, andâ‰¥2 yr) were also compared. A total of 58 RYGB and 128 controls met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Composite therapeutic failure occurred in the RYGB and control group in 14 (24.1%) and 20 patients (15.6%), respectively (P = .18; odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval .8-4.4). RYGB patients who received fluoroquinolones or sulfonamides had a significantly increased risk of therapeutic failure. RYGB was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk of composite therapeutic failure of oral antibiotics in the treatment of urinary tract infection, skin and soft tissue infection, or community acquired pneumonia compared with patients with no history of gastrointestinal resection. Further research is warranted to understand clinical outcomes of RYGB patients who receive oral antibiotics.",10.1016/j.soard.2017.03.026,,,,1007
423,Methodological issues in assessing change in dietary intake and appetite following gastric bypass surgery: A systematic review.,"Gastric bypass surgery is an effective long-term treatment for individuals with severe obesity. Changes in appetite, dietary intake, and food preferences have all been postulated to contribute to postoperative body weight regulation, however, findings are inconsistent. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the current literature on changes in dietary intake and appetite following gastric bypass surgery, in the context of the methodology used and the analysis, interpretation, and presentation of results. Four databases were systematically searched with terms related to ""gastric bypass surgery,"" ""appetite,"" and ""dietary intake,"" and 49 papers (n = 2384 patients after gastric bypass) were eligible for inclusion. The evidence indicated that only a reduction in overall energy intake and an increase in postprandial satiety are maintained beyond 6-month post-surgery, whereas relative macronutrient intake and premeal hunger remain unchanged. However, available data were limited by inconsistencies in the methods, analysis, presentation, and interpretation of results. In particular, there was a reliance on data collected by subjective methods with minimal acknowledgment of the limitations, such as misreporting of food intake. There is a need for further work employing objective measurement of appetite and dietary intake following gastric bypass surgery to determine how these mechanisms may contribute to weight regulation in the longer term.",10.1111/obr.13202,,,,1008
1466,Intermittent wound perfusion for postoperative pain relief following upper abdominal surgery: a surgeon's perspective.,"Although there are many methods for postoperative pain management, implementation may be limited in some settings due to practical or financial constraints. Simple, inexpensive and easily implemented analgesic methods may improve access to effective pain relief. Fifty patients undergoing truncal vagotomy and gastrojejunostomy for pyloric stenosis secondary to chronic duodenal ulceration were studied in this prospective randomized trial. Subjects were assigned to receive either wound perfusion with 8 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine every 5 hours through a catheter placed subcutaneously or intravenous pethidine 0.2 mg/kg on demand for postoperative pain relief. Postoperative pain scores at rest were measured by visual analog scale and the opioid requirement at 0-12 hours, at 12-24 hours and at 24-36 hours were compared. Changes in respiratory parameters were also compared between the two groups. Pain scores at 0-12 hours were significantly lower in the wound perfusion group compared with the intravenous pethidine group (5.7 +/- 1.3 vs. 4.3 +/- 1.2, mean +/- SD; P < 0.001). The number of doses of analgesic required in the wound perfusion group was significantly lower compared with the controls during the 36 hours of study (3.5 +/- 1.3 vs. 1.4 +/- 1.0, P < 0.001). There were no differences in respiratory parameters, vital capacity, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate between the two groups. The FEV1:FVC ratio, however, was significantly higher in the intravenous pethidine group. There were no wound complications due to catheter placement or systemic toxicity due to the anesthetic. Intermittent wound perfusion with 0.25% bupivacaine is a safe and efficient method to reduce pain scores and opioid requirement in the early postoperative period. Wound perfusion, however, had no beneficial effect on the postoperative respiratory function.",10.1111/j.1533-2500.2008.00248.x,,,,1009
1467,"Impact of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on metabolic syndrome, inflammation, and insulin resistance in super versus morbidly obese women.","Although Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) is one of the preferred bariatric procedures in obese individuals, the efficacy of this procedure in the setting of super-obesity [body mass index (BMI) >/=50] is unclear. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of laparoscopic (L) RYGBP to reverse metabolic syndrome, inflammation, and insulin resistance in super-obese women compared to morbidly obese women. Seventy-three consecutive women were enrolled in this prospective study. Anthropometric, metabolic, and inflammatory biological parameters were assessed in 18 super-obese and 55 morbidly obese women before LRYGBP and 1 year after surgery. Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed according to the International Diabetes Federation definition. Before surgery, super-obese women had a higher BMI, fat mass, blood insulin, and HOMA1-IR than morbidly obese women. Both groups had similar serum levels of C-reactive protein and orosomucoid. The incidence of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and increased liver enzymes was comparable in the two groups. One year after LRYGBP, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, metabolic and inflammatory biological parameters were improved in the whole study population. A similar degree of improvement was observed in super-obese and morbidly obese women, although BMI and fat mass were persistently higher in super-obese patients. One year after surgery, LRYGBP was equally effective at reversing metabolic syndrome, inflammation, and insulin resistance in morbidly obese and super-obese women.",10.1007/s11695-008-9764-8,,,,1010
1329,Effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass vs sleeve gastrectomy on glucose and gut hormones: a prospective randomised trial.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is the most common bariatric technique. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a restrictive procedure; the metabolic and endocrine effects of which remain unknown. We compared the effects of both procedures on glucose metabolism and fasting and meal-stimulated gut hormone levels. Seven patients were randomised to LRYGB and eight to LSG. All patients were evaluated before and at 3 and 12 months postoperatively. Plasma levels of glucose, insulin, ghrelin, leptin, peptide YY (PYY), GLP-1 and pancreatic polypeptide were measured before and after 10 and 60 min of a standard test meal ingestion. Age, body mass index and preoperative hormone levels were similar in both groups. A significant reduction of plasma glucose and insulin levels was observed after surgery. Moreover, a normalisation of homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance value was also seen after both procedures. The fasting and postprandial leptin levels were significantly lower in the LRYGB group. LSG was followed by a significant reduction in fasting ghrelin levels. In the LRYGB group, GLP-1 levels increased significantly after the test meal. LRYGB and LSG markedly improved glucose homeostasis. Only LSG decreased fasting and postprandial ghrelin levels, whereas GLP-1 and PYY levels increased similarly after both procedures.",10.1007/s11605-012-1855-0,,,,1011
49,"Comparative impact of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy or diet alone on beta-cell function in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients.","Although bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes by inducing weight loss and augmenting gut hormone secretion, the immediate effect on beta-cell function itself remains to be elucidated in type 2 diabetes. Therefore, a prospective, randomized trial was performed in 30 patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes and a body mass indexâ€‰â‰¥â€‰35Â kg/m2. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in combination with protein-sparing modified fast (PSMF), or to PSMF alone. Eu- and hyperglycemic clamps were performed before and 3Â weeks after surgery and/or PSMF initiation. The primary outcome was the evolution of insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function after surgery, calculated using the composite measures of glucose disposal rate, insulin secretion rate, and disposition index (DI). Results revealed that markers of insulin sensitivity increased similarly in all arms (pâ€‰=â€‰0.43). A higher marker for maximal beta-cell function was observed when comparing SG to PSMF (pâ€‰=â€‰0.007). The DI showed a clear positive evolution after RYGB and SG, but not after PSMF alone. Altogether, these findings indicate that bariatric surgery results in an immediate beta-cell function recovery in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes.",10.1038/s41598-024-59048-w,,,,1012
1581,The pharmacodynamic effects of rocuronium when dosed according to real body weight or ideal body weight in morbidly obese patients.,"We investigated the pharmacodynamic effects of rocuronium on morbidly obese patients. Twelve morbidly obese female patients (body mass index >40 kg/m(2)) admitted for laparoscopic gastric banding were randomized into two groups. Group 1 (n = 6) received 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium based on real body weight, whereas Group 2 (n = 6) received 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium based on ideal body weight. In a control group of six normal-weight female patients admitted for laparoscopic surgery, rocuronium was dosed on the basis of their real body weight. Neuromuscular transmission was monitored by using acceleromyography of the adductor pollicis; anesthesia was induced and maintained with remifentanil and propofol. The onset time tended to be shorter in Group 1 and the control group compared with Group 2, but this did not achieve statistical significance. Duration of action to 25% of twitch tension was more than double in Group 1 (55 min) compared with the other two groups (22 and 25 min; P < 0.001). Duration of action was similar between Group 2 and control. Recovery index tended to be longer in Group 1, but without a significant difference. In conclusion, in morbidly obese patients, the duration of action of rocuronium is significantly prolonged when it is dosed according to real body weight. Therefore, the dosage should be assessed on the basis of ideal rather than on real body weight in clinical practice.",10.1213/01.ANE.0000120081.99080.C2,,,,1013
1123,Road Running After Gastric Bypass for Morbid Obesity: Rationale and Results of a New Protocol.,"In recent years, the pandemic explosion of obesity has led to the definition of a pre-eminent therapeutic role for bariatric surgery, confining physical activity to a success parameter of surgery rather than a primary prevention measure. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role for aerobic physical activity (road running) in strengthening the metabolic and psychosocial effects of bariatric surgery. Ten patients who underwent gastric bypass for morbid obesity were submitted to an intensive program of road running training, aimed at completing a 10.5-km competition in September 2013. Inclusion criteria included age (<50), BMI (<35), suitability for sport activity, and good compliance. A cohort of 10 patients excluded for logistical issues were enrolled as a control group. During the training period, patients were submitted to biometrical, sport performance, cardiopulmonary, metabolic, and psychiatric evaluations. Protocol adherence was 70 %; no physical injury was registered among participants. More than weight loss (BMI 29.3 to 27.1), the runners experienced a redistribution of body mass with significant differences in fat percentage and waist/hip ratio. Participants had a significant running performance improvement and, differently from the controls, a significant amelioration of echocardiographic and cardiopulmonary parameters, predicting a reduction in cardiovascular risk. Psychiatric evaluation underlined a tendency to a reduction in anxiety, depression, and general psychopathology symptoms. Road running seems to have an important supporting role in boosting bariatric surgery results. The utilization of monitored and regulated training programs represents a fundamental prerequisite to achieving satisfactory results and patient compliance.",10.1007/s11695-014-1517-2,,,,1014
716,Risk of Suicide and Self-harm Is Increased After Bariatric Surgery-a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Bariatric surgery is endorsed by multiple societies as the most effective treatment for obesity. Psychosocial functioning has also been noted to improve for most patients after bariatric surgery. However, some studies have shown an increase in post-operative suicideÂ risk. The aim of this study was to review the published literature and evaluate the association of bariatric surgery with suicide events and suicide/self-harm attempts in patients who have undergone weight loss surgery. MEDLINE and Embase were searched from inception through January 2018 for retrospective or prospective studies reporting mortality outcomes and self-harm or suicide rates after bariatric procedures. The primary outcome was the pooled event rate with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for suicide. Secondary outcomes were suicide/self-harm attempts after bariatric surgery compared to same population prior to surgery and to matched control subjects, with the respective calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI. From 227 citations, 32 studies with 148,643 subjects were eligible for inclusion. The patients were predominantly females (76.9%). Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) was the most commonly performed procedure (58.9%). The post-bariatric suicide event rate was 2.7/1000 patients (95% CI 0.0019-0.0038), while the suicide/self-harm attempt event rate was 17/1000 patients (95% CI 0.01-0.03). The self-harm/suicide attempt risk was higher after bariatric surgery within the same population with OR of 1.9 (95% CI 1.23-2.95), and compared to matched control subjects, OR 3.8 (95% CI, 2.19-6.59). Post-bariatric surgery patients had higher self-harm/suicide attempt risk compared to age-, sex-, and BMI-matched controls. Various pre- and post-surgical psychosocial, pharmacokinetic, physiologic, and medical factors may be involved.",10.1007/s11695-018-3493-4,,,,1015
1303,"Lower ghrelin levels and exaggerated postprandial peptide-YY, glucagon-like peptide-1, and insulin responses, after gastric fundus resection, in patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a randomized clinical trial.","Laparoscopic Roux-en Y-Gastric bypass (LRYGBP) is the commonest available option for the surgical treatment of morbid obesity. Weight loss following bariatric surgery has been linked to changes of gastrointestinal peptides, shown to be implicated also in metabolic effects and appetite control. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether gastric fundus resection in patients undergoing LRYGBP enhances the efficacy of the procedure in terms of weight loss, glucose levels, and hormonal secretion. Twelve patients underwent LRYGBP and 12 patients LRYGBP plus gastric fundus resection (LRYGBP+FR). All patients were evaluated before and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Blood samples were collected after an overnight fast and 30, 60, and 120 min after a standard 300-kcal mixed meal. Body weight and body mass index decreased markedly and comparably after both procedures. Fasting ghrelin decreased 3 months after LRYGBP, but increased at 12 months to levels higher than baseline while after LRYGBP+FR was markedly and persistently decreased. Postprandial GLP-1, PYY, and insulin responses were enhanced more and postprandial glucose levels were lower after LRYGBP+FR compared to LRYGBP. Postoperatively, ghrelin changes correlated negatively with GLP-1 changes. Resection of the gastric fundus in patients undergoing LRYGBP was associated with persistently lower fasting ghrelin levels; higher postprandial PYY, GLP-1, and insulin responses; and lower postprandial glucose levels compared to LRYGBP. These findings suggest that fundus resection in the setting of LRYGBP may be more effective than RYGBP for the management of morbid obesity and diabetes type 2.",10.1007/s11695-012-0738-5,,,,1016
1015,The Effect of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery in Morbidly Obese Patients on Pharmacokinetics of (Acetyl)Salicylic Acid and Omeprazole: the ERY-PAO Study.,"Data on the absorption of orally administered drugs following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery in obese patients are limited and inconclusive. As it is difficult to predict changes in absorption, studies on frequently used drugs in this population are necessary. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and omeprazole are two commonly prescribed drugs in obese patients. In this repeated measures study, omeprazole and salicylic acid (SA) serum concentrations were measured before and after RYGB in 34 morbidly obese subjects. Time to maximum concentration (Tmax), lag time (Tlag), maximum concentration (Cmax), and area under the serum concentration versus time curve (AUC) were calculated for both drugs to determine possible differences in drug absorption after the procedure. For SA, Tmax significantly decreased after RYGB, while both Cmax and AUC0-24 significantly increased. For omeprazole, both Tmax and Tlag significantly decreased after RYGB, while Cmax significantly increased. Mean AUC0-12 significantly decreased post-surgery. The difference in AUC0-12 before and after surgery varied between subjects. Our study shows a faster absorption of both ASA and omeprazole after RYGB. The exposure to ASA is higher post-surgery, but the standard dose of 80Â mg does not need to be modified, considering its range in effective dose. The exposure to omeprazole is, on average, decreased after surgery. Clinicians should be aware to increase the dose of omeprazole if symptoms suggest inadequate response.",10.1007/s11695-016-2065-8,,,,1017
1608,Non-opioid analgesia improves pain relief and decreases sedation after gastric bypass surgery.,"Several non-opioid drugs have been shown to provide analgesia during and after surgery. We compared sevoflurane anesthesia with fentanyl analgesia to sevoflurane and non-opioid drug treatment for gastric bypass surgery and recovery. Thirty obese patients (body mass index > 50 kg.m(-2)) undergoing gastric bypass were randomized to receive sevoflurane anesthesia with either fentanyl or a non-opioid regimen including ketorolac, clonidine, lidocaine, ketamine, magnesium sulfate, and methylprednisolone. Morphine use by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump and pain score measured by visual analogue scale were determined in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and for the first 16 hr after surgery. Sedation was evaluated in the PACU. Investigators assessing patient outcomes were blinded to the study group. Fentanyl treated patients were more sedated in the PACU compared to the non-opioid group. Non-opioid treated patients required 5.2 +/- 2.6 mg.hr(-1) morphine by PCA during their stay in the PACU while patients anesthetized with fentanyl used 7.8 +/- 3.3 mg.hr(-1) (P < 0.05). Fentanyl and non-opioid treated patients showed no difference in pain score one or 16 hr after surgery. Our results show that non-opioid analgesia produced pain relief and less sedation during recovery from gastric bypass surgery compared to fentanyl.",10.1007/BF03021029,,,,1018
632,Does C-reactive Protein Have a Predictive Role in the Early Diagnosis of Postoperative Complications After Bariatric Surgery? Systematic Review and Bayesian Meta-analysis.,"Postoperative leak and intra-abdominal infections are common after bariatric surgery with a significant impact on perioperative outcomes, hospital length of stay, and readmission rates. In the era of enhanced recovery programs, with patients being discharged from the hospital 24-36Â h after surgery and potentially before developing any complications, an early indicator of postoperative complications may be decisive. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive role of the C-reactive protein (CRP) in the early diagnosis of complications in patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were consulted. A systematic review and a fully Bayesian meta-analysis were conducted. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria for a total of 1401 patients. Overall, 57.7% underwent LSG while 42.3% underwent LRYGB. The pooled prevalence of postoperative complications was 9.8% (95% CIâ€‰=â€‰5-16%). The estimated pooled CRP cut-off value on postoperative day 1 (POD1) was 6.1Â mg/dl with a significant diagnostic accuracy and a pooled area under the curve of 0.92 (95% credible interval (CrI) 0.73-0.98). The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 13.6 (95% CrI 8.40-15.9) and 0.16 (95% CrI 0.04-0.31), respectively. A CRP value lower than the derived cut-off of 6.1Â mg/dl on POD1, combined with reassuring clinical signs, could be useful to rule out early postoperative leak and complications after LSG and LRYGB. In the context of enhanced recovery after surgery protocols, the integration of a CRP-based diagnostic algorithm as an additional complementary instrument may be valuable to reduce cost and improve outcomes and patient care.",10.1007/s11695-019-04013-0,,,,1019
606,The incidence of iron deficiency anemia post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy: a systematic review.,"The physiological and anatomical changes that occur as a consequence of bariatric surgery result in macro- and micro-nutritional deficiencies, especially iron deficiency. The reported incidence of iron deficiency and associated anemia after bariatric surgery varies widely across studies. The aim of this systematic review is to quantify the impact of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) on the incidence of iron deficiency. Databases including Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Helthstar, Scopus, Cochrane (CDSR), LILACS, and ClinicalKey were searched for original articles with additional snowballing search. Search terms included Obesity, nutrient deficiency, iron deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, bariatric surgery, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and sleeve gastrectomy. Original articles reporting the incidence of iron deficiency and anemia pre- and post-RYGB and SG from January 2000 to January 2015 with minimum 1-year follow-up were selected. Data extraction from selected studies was based on protocol-defined criteria. There were 1133 articles screened and 20 studies were included in the final analysis. The overall incidence of iron deficiency was 15.2% pre-operatively and 16.6% post-operatively. When analyzed by procedure, the incidence of iron deficiency was 12.9% pre-RYGB versus 24.5% post-RYGB and 36.6% pre-SG versus 12.4% post-SG. The incidence of iron deficiency-related anemia was 16.7% post-RYGB and 1.6% post-SG. Risk factors for iron deficiency were premenopausal females, duration of follow-up, and pre-operative iron deficiency. Prophylactic iron supplementation was reported in 16 studies and 2 studies provided therapeutic iron supplementation only for iron-deficient patients. Iron dosage varied from 7 to 80Â mg daily across studies. Iron deficiency is frequent in people with obesity and may be exacerbated by bariatric surgery, especially RYGB. Further investigation is warranted to determine appropriate iron supplementation dosages following bariatric surgery. Careful nutritional surveillance is important, especially for premenopausal females and those with pre-existing iron deficiency.",10.1007/s00464-019-07092-3,,,,1020
85,Nonhepatic hyperammonemic encephalopathy following bariatric surgery: A systematic review.,"Nonhepatic Hyperammonemic encephalopathy (NHAE) following Bariatric Surgery (BS), mainly Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) and Biliopancreatic Diversion (BPD) is a potentially devastating condition if not diagnosed and managed promptly. A literature review was performed using PRISMA guidelines. Eighteen studies and 3 conference abstracts with a total of 33 patients were included in this review. Majority (28 patients, 84.8 %) had RYGB. Seven patients (21.2 %) had associated metabolic disorders. 60 % of patients presented with neurological symptoms or signs such as confusion, cognitive and/or psychomotor changes, and decreased reflexes. Two patients presented with status epilepticus. In 30 of the 33 patients an elevated serum ammonia levels was reported (90.9 %). The overall mortality was 39.3 %. NHAE is a rare condition following bariatric surgery (in particular bypass procedures), carrying a high mortality rate. The signs and symptoms are predominantly neurological and may be mistaken for Wernicke's encephalopathy or other more common neurological conditions. Serum ammonia levels should be checked in those who present with these symptoms and signs. Prompt treatment might be life saving in patients with NHAE.",10.1016/j.orcp.2023.11.001,,,,1021
751,Increased Bile Acids and FGF19 After Sleeve Gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Correlate with Improvement in Type 2 Diabetes in a Randomized Trial.,"Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) are both effective bariatric procedures to treat type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and obesity. The contribution of changes in bile acids (BAs) and fibroblast growth factor19 (FGF19) to such metabolic improvements is unclear. We examined associations between changes in BAs, FGF19 (fasting and prandial), with changes in body weight, glycemia, and other metabolic variables in 61 obese patients with T2DM before and 1Â year after randomization to SG or RYGB. Weight loss and diabetes remission (defined by HbA1c <â€‰39Â mmol/mol [<â€‰5.7%] in the absence of glucose-lowering therapy) after RYGB and SG was similar (mean weight loss -â€‰29 vs -â€‰31Â kg, pâ€‰=â€‰0.50; diabetes remission proportion 37.5 vs 34%, pâ€‰=â€‰1.0). Greater increments in fasting and prandial levels of total, secondary, and unconjugated BAs were seen after RYGB than SG. Fasting and prandial increases in total (râ€‰=â€‰-â€‰0.3, pâ€‰=â€‰0.01; râ€‰=â€‰-â€‰0.2, pâ€‰=â€‰0.04), secondary (râ€‰=â€‰-â€‰0.3, pâ€‰=â€‰0.01; râ€‰=â€‰-â€‰0.4, pâ€‰=â€‰0.01) and unconjugated BA (râ€‰=â€‰-â€‰0.3, pâ€‰=â€‰0.01; râ€‰=â€‰0.4, pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) correlated with decreases in HbA1c, but not weight. Changes in 12Î±-OH/non 12Î±-OH were positively associated with prandial glucose increments (râ€‰=â€‰0.2, pâ€‰=â€‰0.03), HbA1c (râ€‰=â€‰0.3, pâ€‰=â€‰0.01), and negatively associated with changes in insulinogenc index (râ€‰=â€‰-â€‰0.3, pâ€‰=â€‰0.01). Only changes in prandial FGF19 were negatively associated with HbA1c (râ€‰=â€‰-â€‰0.4, pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) and visceral fat (râ€‰=â€‰-â€‰0.3, pâ€‰=â€‰0.04). The association between increases in secondary, unconjugated BAs and improvements in HBA1c (but not weight) achieved after both RYGB and SG suggest manipulation of BA as a potential strategy for controlling T2DM through weight-independent means.",10.1007/s11695-018-3216-x,,,,1022
764,Is There Association between Vitamin D Concentrations and Body Mass Index Variation in Women Submitted to Y-Roux Surgery?,"To evaluate vitamin D deficiency and body composition of women submitted to bariatric surgery and relate their body mass index variation after surgery to 25(OH)D concentrations. A cross-sectional and controlled study was performed including 49 obese adult volunteer women, submitted to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB group). Body mass index (BMI), self-declared ethnicity, economic condition, physical activity level, serum concentrations of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D; radioimmunoassay), parathormone, and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Hologic DXA-QDR-1000) were collected. 25(OH)D deficiency was found in 27 (55.1%) and 8 (21.1%) in the RYGB and control groups (p=0.002). Secondary hyperparathyroidism was more frequent in the RYGB group compared to the control group (15 (30.6%) versus 1 (2.6%); p=0.001). There was no relation of the studied variables and body composition with 25(OH)D deficiency. 25(OH)D concentrations were correlated (r=-0.531;â€‚p < 0.001) with BMI reduction, regardless of vitamin D supplementation. Women submitted to bariatric surgery (RYGB) around three years ago had higher BMI and vitamin D deficiency, along with hyperparathyroidism, compared to the control group. There was no association between variables related to body composition and 25(OH)D concentrations. On the other hand, vitamin concentrations correlated negatively to BMI variation after undergoing surgery.",10.1155/2018/3251675,,,,1023
1280,The impact of bariatric surgery on obstructive sleep apnea: a systematic review.,"There is a strong relationship between obesity and the development of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Respectively, bariatric surgery is often touted as the most effective option for treating obesity and its comorbidities, including OSA. Nevertheless, there remains paucity of data in the literature of the comparison of all the specific types of bariatric surgery themselves. In an effort to answer this question, a systematic review was performed, to determine, of the available bariatric procedures [Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, or biliopancreatic diversion (BPD)], which procedures were the most efficacious in the treatment of OSA. A total of 69 studies with 13,900 patients were included. All the procedures achieved profound effects on OSA, as over 75 % of patients saw at least an improvement in their sleep apnea. BPD was the most successful procedure in improving or resolving OSA, with laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding being the least. In conclusion, bariatric surgery is a definitive treatment for obstructive sleep apnea, regardless of the specific type.",10.1007/s11695-012-0862-2,,,,1024
658,Improvement in Food Intolerance Resulting from Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass after Speech Therapy Intervention in Chewing.,"Food intolerance is expected during the postoperative period following gastric bypass and may be associated with inadequate chewing. To evaluate chewing before and after speech therapy intervention in subjects undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass who present with food intolerance. This was a randomized controlled trial, approved by the Brazilian Ethics and Research Committee under n. 438,600. The study population was allocated into two groups: the study group (SG), who received speech therapy intervention, and the control group (CG), who did not receive any intervention, in six visits at 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90Â days (v7, v15, v30, v60, and v90) after the initial visit (v0). During v0 and v90, a chewing evaluation was performed according to the MBGR protocol adapted. The significance level adopted was 5%. A total of 30 females (88%) and 4 males (12%) were analyzed. The SG had 18 subjects, and the CG had 16, with mean ages of 50.17â€‰Â±â€‰12.28Â years and 45.69â€‰Â±â€‰9.78Â years, respectively. The postoperative time ranged from 4 to19Â months. In the SG, a marked improvement in the number of episodes of food intolerance was observed (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), an improvement in the intake of cereals and meats (pâ€‰=â€‰0.004 and pâ€‰<â€‰0.001, respectively), and an improvement in chewing capacity and swallowing (pâ€‰=â€‰0.002 and pâ€‰=â€‰0.011, respectively). Speech therapy intervention in chewing led to a marked improvement of food acceptance and food intolerance resulting from Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.",10.1007/s11695-019-03931-3,,,,1025
204,Gut Microbiota Profile in Adults Undergoing Bariatric Surgery: A Systematic Review.,"Gut microbiota (GM) after bariatric surgery (BS) has been considered as a factor associated with metabolic improvements and weight loss. In this systematic review, we evaluate changes in the GM, characterized by 16S rRNA and metagenomics techniques, in obese adults who received BS. The PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and LILACS databases were searched. Two independent reviewers analyzed articles published in the last ten years, using Rayyan QCRI. The initial search resulted in 1275 documents, and 18 clinical trials were included after the exclusion criteria were applied. The predominance of intestinal bacteria phyla varied among studies; however, most of them reported a greater amount of Bacteroidetes (B), Proteobacteria (P), and diversity (D) after BS. Firmicutes (F), B, and the (F/B) ratio was inconsistent, increasing or decreasing after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) were conducted, compared to before surgery. There was a reduction in the relative proportion of F. Moreover, a higher proportion of Actinobacteria (A) was observed after RYGB was conducted. However, the same was not identified when SG procedures were applied.

1176,Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for nonobese type II diabetes mellitus in Asian patients.,"The beneficial role of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2 DM) in morbidly obese patients has been established; however, there is scant evidence supporting its effectiveness in nonobese T2 DM Asian patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of LRYGB in nonobese T2 DM patients and elucidate the predictors of DM remission after one year follow-up. Between June 2009 and May 2011, twenty-nine nonobese (body mass index (BMI)<27 kg/m(2)) Asian patients with T2 DM who underwent LRYGB were enrolled. All patients were prospectively followed up for one year. Baseline demographic characteristics, diabetic status, and clinical and biochemical data were collected preoperatively and one year after LRYGB. DM remission was defined as those with hemoglobin A1 c (HbA1 c)<6.5% without oral hypoglycemic drugs (OHA)/insulin. Outcomes in the DM remission group were compared with the nonremission group and analyzed. All clinical and biochemical parameters, except uric acid, were significantly improved. DM remission was achieved in eleven patients (37.9%) of whom five (45.5%) were male. Blood glucose, HbA1 c, c-peptide, homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-%B), and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol were the significant variables in patients with DM remission; however, multiple logistic regression showed that only preoperative HOMA-%B (odds ratio (OR) = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.03-1.24) was a predictor for DM remission. Though no mortality was seen, the complication rate was 20.7%, of which 17.3% was related to marginal ulcers. LRYGB resulted in significant clinical and biochemical improvements in nonobese Asian patients, with HOMA-%B indicating Î²-cell function as the main predictor of T2 DM remission. Appropriate patient selection with better Î²-cell function and evidence from long-term follow-up may justify this therapeutic approach.",10.1016/j.soard.2014.01.018,,,,1027
1388,Effect of antecolic or retrocolic reconstruction of the gastro/duodenojejunostomy on delayed gastric emptying after pancreaticoduodenectomy: a randomized controlled trial.,"To study the effect of antecolic vs. retrocolic reconstruction on delayed gastric emptying (DGE) after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and to analyze factors which may be associated with post-PD DGE. DGE is a troublesome complication occurring in 30-40% of patients undergoing PD leading to increased postoperative morbidity. Many factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of DGE. Among the various methods employed to reduce the incidence, recent reports have suggested that an antecolic reconstruction of gastro/duodenojejunostomy may decrease the incidence of DGE. Between Sep 2006 and Nov 2008, 95 patients requiring PD (for both malignant and benign conditions) were eligible for the study. Of these, 72 patients finally underwent a PD and were randomized to either a retrocolic or antecolic reconstruction of the gastro/duodenojejunostomy. All patients underwent the standard Whipple's or a pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD), and the randomization was stratified according to the type of PD done. DGE was assessed clinically using the Johns Hopkins criteria (Yeo et al. in Ann Surg 218: 229-37, 1993). In patients suspected to have DGE, mechanical causes were excluded by imaging and/or endoscopy. Occurrence of DGE was the primary endpoint, whereas duration of hospital stay and occurrence of intra-abdominal complications were the secondary end points. The antecolic and retrocolic groups were comparable with regard to patient demographics, diagnosis, and other preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors. Overall, DGE occurred in 21 patients (30.9%). There was no significant difference in the incidence of DGE in the antecolic vs. the retrocolic group (34.4% vs. 27.8%; pâ€‰=â€‰0.6). On univariate analysis, older age, use of octreotide, and intra-abdominal complications were significantly associated with the occurrence of DGE; however, on a multivariate analysis, only age was found to be significant (pâ€‰=â€‰0.02). The mean postoperative stay was longer among patients who developed DGE (21.9â€‰Â±â€‰9.3 days vs. 13â€‰Â±â€‰6.9 days; pâ€‰=â€‰0.0001). Delayed gastric emptying is a cause of significant morbidity and prolongs the duration of hospitalization following pancreaticoduodenectomy. The incidence of DGE does not appear to be related to the method of reconstruction (antecolic or retrocolic). Older age may be a risk factor for its occurrence.",10.1007/s11605-011-1480-3,,,,1028
780,Food Tolerance and Eating Behavior After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery often leads to food intolerance, especially protein intake. This is to investigate the association of food intolerance with protein intake and chewing parameters in patients who underwent RYGB surgery 2Â years prior. An observational study was carried out in 30 patients aged between 18 and 60Â years old with at least a 2-year postoperative period since undergoing RYGB surgery. A specific questionnaire was applied to obtain a food tolerance score; a masticatory efficiency, chewing cycles, and time were evaluated with a standard test based on the size of the fragmentation of almonds and of meat after a certain chewing time. Protein intake was evaluated by 24-h dietary recall. Mean age was 42.3Â Â±Â 11.2Â years; mean body mass index was 33Â Â±Â 6 kg/m2; and mean time since surgery was 4.9Â years. The food tolerance score was 23.4Â Â±Â 3.3 points. There was no evidence of an association between food tolerance and chewing efficiency for meat (pÂ =Â 0.28) nor between food tolerance and protein intake (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.03, pÂ =Â 0.86). Regarding chewing efficiency with almonds, tolerance was higher in patients with optimal efficiency than among those with good and acceptable efficiency (pÂ =Â 0.01). In the evaluation of mastication using almonds, food tolerance increased with the number of chewing cycles and with greater chewing efficiency; the same association was not found in the evaluation using red meat.",10.1007/s11695-017-2850-z,,,,1029
1180,Perioperative glycaemic control in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery.,"Roux-and-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) rapidly reduces insulin requirements in patients with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus (Tâ‚‚DMi). A too modest reduction in insulin dose may lead to hypoglycaemia in the early postoperative period. To evaluate a regimen designed to maintain blood glucose levels between 5-15 mmol/l and to prevent hypoglycaemic events (blood glucose <3.5 mmol/l) after RYGB surgery. The effect of a 75% reduction in insulin dose was studied in 85 Tâ‚‚DMi patients during the first ten days after RYGB. Patients with severe b-cell failure (fasting C-peptide <0.3 nmol/l) were excluded. percentage of patients exceeding the upper or lower blood glucose limits, and the number of hypoglycaemic events. The mean blood glucose level was 12.4Â±0.3 mmol/l (mean Â± SE) on the day of surgery (day 0), 10.7Â±0.3 mmol/l on day 1, 10.0Â±0.5 mmol/l on day 2, and 8.3Â±0.3 on day 10. Of all measurements performed during this ten-day period, 12.4% were above the target range, and 2.6% were <5 mmol/l. There were no hypoglycaemic events during the stay in hospital. During the first week at home 2% of the measurements were <3.5 mmol/l. A 75% reduction in insulin dose is safe in Tâ‚‚DMi patients without severe b-cell failure, and prevents hypoglycaemia in the early postoperative period of RYGB in most cases.",,,,,1030
1002,ÃŸ-cell pancreatic dysfunction plays a role in hyperglycemic peaks observed after gastric bypass surgery of obese patients.,"Early and intense hyperglycemic peaks are observed after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The aim of this observational study was to compare the ÃŸ-cell pancreatic function of patients with (PEAK) and without hyperglycemic peaks (NOPEAK). Referral bariatric surgery center. Insulin secretion rate, clearance, and sensitivity and ÃŸ-cell and rate sensitivities were computed after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test in 42 patients who underwent RYGB. PEAK patients (n = 18; 30-min glycemia>10.4 mmol/L) did not differ from NOPEAK patients (n = 24) in their presurgery or weight loss characteristics. PEAK patients had significantly higher plasma concentrations of glucose and C-peptide than did NOPEAK patients, whereas insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 concentrations did not differ. The insulin secretion rate and whole-body insulin clearance (208%) were significantly greater, but insulin sensitivity was significantly less (48%) in PEAK patients. Insulin secretion normalized to plasma glucose was significantly lower in PEAK patients, and the disposition index was reduced (35% to 41% of the values in NOPEAK patients). We conclude that RYGB reveals a series of dysfunctions leading to hyperglycemia in a subset of patients. In PEAK patients, an insufficient adaptation of ÃŸ-cell function to glycemia, an increased insulin clearance, and a decreased insulin sensitivity cumulated to contribute to hyperglycemic peaks.",10.1016/j.soard.2015.10.073,,,,1031
1432,Randomized clinical trial of laparoscopic gastric bypass versus laparoscopic duodenal switch for superobesity.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (LDS) are surgical options for superobesity. A randomized trial was conducted to evaluate perioperative (30-day) safety and 1-year results. Sixty patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 50-60 kg/m(2) were randomized to LRYGB or LDS. BMI, percentage of excess BMI lost, complications and readmissions were compared between groups. Patient characteristics were similar in the two groups. Mean operating time was 91 min for LRYGB and 206 min for LDS (P < 0.001). One LDS was converted to open surgery. Early complications occurred in four patients undergoing LRYGB and seven having LDS (P = 0.327), with no deaths. Median stay was 2 days after LRYGB and 4 days after LDS (P < 0.001). Four and nine patients respectively had late complications (P = 0.121). Mean BMI at 1 year decreased from 54.8 to 38.5 kg/m(2) after LRYGB and from 55.2 to 32.5 kg/m(2) after LDS; percentage of excess BMI lost was greater after LDS (74.8 versus 54.4 per cent; P < 0.001). LRYGB and LDS can be performed with comparable perioperative safety in superobese patients. LDS provides greater weight loss in the first year.",10.1002/bjs.6802,,,,1032
218,Bariatric surgery and secondary hyperparathyroidism: a meta-analysis.,"Obesity increases the risk of obesity-related medical problems. Weight loss after metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) has been well studied. However, the effects of MBS on parathyroid function remain unclear. The objective of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to examine the impact of MBS on the risk of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China. The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases were systematically reviewed from inception to May 2022 to identify studies reporting quantitative measurements of SHPT risk pre-MBS and post-MBS. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated and compared. Effects were pooled using a random-effects or fixed-effects model. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the follow-up time and surgical procedure. The final meta-analysis included 9 studies with a total of 5585 patients. The mean follow-up time was 3.5 years (range 0.25-5). Overall, MBS appears to does not affect SHPT risk (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 0.81-2.20, I2 = 95%). Follow-up data showed no evidence of SHPT within 2 years following gastric bypass (GB) and sleeve gastrectomy procedures (OR = 1.42, 95% CI 0.66-3.07 for GB, OR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.09-1.62 for sleeve gastrectomy ). At the 2-year and long-term follow-up intervals, a marked increase in SHPT was detected for GB (OR = 6.06, 95% CI 3.39-10.85 for GB). In addition, the surgical procedure for GB decreased the likelihood of SHPT compared with the surgical procedure for biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (OR = 0.29, 95% CI 0.17-0.49). Our meta-analysis indicated that GB appears to increase SHPT risk. Patients undergoing MBS should be aware of the risk of SHPT. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the outcomes and side effects and may eventually provide a better and more comprehensive understanding of the risks.",10.1016/j.soard.2022.09.013,,,,1033
634,Influence of Energy Balance on the Rate of Weight Loss Throughout One Year of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: a Doubly Labeled Water Study.,"To investigate the influence of changes in energy balance and body composition on the rate of weight loss throughout 1Â year of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Variables were collected pre-, 6, and 12Â months (M) post-surgery from 18 women (BMIâ€‰â‰¥â€‰40 and â‰¤â€‰50Â kgÂ m-2, 20 to 45Â years). Total energy expenditure (TEEm), fat-free mass (FFM), and fat mass (FM) were measured by doubly labeled water. Self-reported energy intake (EIsr) was obtained from three non-consecutive food diaries. Metabolic adaptation was assessed via deviations from TEE predictive equation, and the calculated energy intake (EIc) via the sum of TEE and change in body stores. BMI significantly decreased (mean Â± SD) from 45â€‰Â±â€‰2Â kgÂ m-2 to 32â€‰Â±â€‰3Â kgÂ m-2 at 6Â M, and to 30â€‰Â±â€‰3Â kgÂ m-2 at 12Â M after surgery. The TEEm reduced significantly at both time points when compared with pre-surgery (6Â M: -â€‰612â€‰Â±â€‰317Â kcalÂ day-1; 12Â M: -â€‰447â€‰Â±â€‰516Â kcalÂ day-1). At 6Â M, a metabolic adaptation was observed and the energy balance was -â€‰1151â€‰Â±â€‰195Â kcalÂ day-1, while at 12Â M it was -â€‰332â€‰Â±â€‰158Â kcalÂ day-1. Changes in the values of TEEm were associated with changes in body weight at 12Â M post-surgery. A significant underreporting was observed for EIsr (1057â€‰Â±â€‰385Â kcalÂ day-1) vs. EIc (2083â€‰Â±â€‰309Â kcalÂ day-1) at 12Â M post-operative. The higher rate of weight loss at 6Â M post-surgery was a response to energy imbalance, which was caused by high restriction in energy intake even with the presence of metabolic adaptation at this time. The EIsr was not sufficiently accurate to assess the energy consumption of this population. Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry: RBR-8k5jsj.

367,Microstructural changes in human ingestive behavior after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass during liquid meals.,"BACKGROUNDRoux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) decreases energy intake and is, therefore, an effective treatment of obesity. The behavioral bases of the decreased calorie intake remain to be elucidated. We applied the methodology of microstructural analysis of meal intake to establish the behavioral features of ingestion in an effort to discern the various controls of feeding as a function of RYGB.METHODSThe ingestive microstructure of a standardized liquid meal in a cohort of 11 RYGB patients, in 10 patients with obesity, and in 10 healthy-weight adults was prospectively assessed from baseline to 1 year with a custom-designed drinkometer. Statistics were performed on log-transformed ratios of change from baseline so that each participant served as their own control, and proportional increases and decreases were numerically symmetrical. Data-driven (3 seconds) and additional burst pause criteria (1 and 5 seconds) were used.RESULTSAt baseline, the mean meal size (909.2 versus 557.6 kCal), burst size (28.8 versus 17.6 mL), and meal duration (433 versus 381 seconds) differed between RYGB patients and healthy-weight controls, whereas suck volume (5.2 versus 4.6 mL) and number of bursts (19.7 versus 20.1) were comparable. At 1 year, the ingestive differences between the RYGB and healthy-weight groups disappeared due to significantly decreased burst size (P = 0.008) and meal duration (P = 0.034) after RYGB. The first-minute intake also decreased after RYGB (P = 0.022).CONCLUSIONRYGB induced dynamic changes in ingestive behavior over the first postoperative year. While the eating pattern of controls remained stable, RYGB patients reduced their meal size by decreasing burst size and meal duration, suggesting that increased postingestive sensibility may mediate postbariatric ingestive behavior.TRIAL REGISTRATIONNCT03747445; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03747445.FUNDINGThis work was supported by the University of Zurich, the Swiss National Fund (32003B_182309), and the Olga Mayenfisch Foundation.

555,Closure of Mesenteric Defects in Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass: a Meta-Analysis.,"The purpose of the current study was to review the available literature on morbidly obese patients treated with laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) in order to assess the clinical outcomes of the routine closure of the mesenteric defects. A literature search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane library, and Scopus, in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. A total of 16,520 patients were incorporated with a mean follow-up ranging from 34 to 120Â months. The closure of the mesenteric defects was associated with a lower incidence of internal hernias (odds ratio, 0.25 [95% confidence interval 0.20, 0.31]; pâ€‰<â€‰0.01), small bowel obstruction (SBO) (0.30 [0.17, 0.52]; pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001) and reoperations (0.28 [0.15, 0.52]; pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Both approaches presented similar complication rates and % excess weight loss (%EWL).

1211,Early enhancements of hepatic and later of peripheral insulin sensitivity combined with increased postprandial insulin secretion contribute to improved glycemic control after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) improves glycemic control within days after surgery, and changes in insulin sensitivity and Î²-cell function are likely to be involved. We studied 10 obese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 10 obese glucose-tolerant subjects before and 1 week, 3 months, and 1 year after RYGB. Participants were included after a preoperative diet-induced total weight loss of -9.2 Â± 1.2%. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity were assessed using the hyperinsulinemic- euglycemic clamp combined with the glucose tracer technique, and Î²-cell function was evaluated in response to an intravenous glucose-glucagon challenge as well as an oral glucose load. Within 1 week, RYGB reduced basal glucose production, improved basal hepatic insulin sensitivity, and increased insulin clearance, highlighting the liver as an important organ responsible for early effects on glucose metabolism after surgery. Insulin-mediated glucose disposal and suppression of fatty acids did not improve immediately after surgery but increased at 3 months and 1 year; this increase likely was related to the reduction in body weight. Insulin secretion increased after RYGB only in patients with T2D and only in response to oral glucose, underscoring the importance of the changed gut anatomy.",10.2337/db13-1307,,,,1037
1218,Improved acylated ghrelin suppression at 2 years in obese patients with type 2 diabetes: effects of bariatric surgery vs standard medical therapy.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) produces more durable glycemic control than sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or intensive medical therapy (IMT). However, the contribution of acylated ghrelin (AG), a gluco-regulatory/appetite hormone, to improve glucose metabolism and body composition in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) following RYGB is unknown. STAMPEDE (Surgical Treatment and Medication Potentially Eradicate Diabetes Efficiently) was a prospective, randomized controlled trial. Fifty-three (body mass index: 36Â±3â€‰kgâ€‰m(-2), age: 49Â±9 years) poorly controlled patients with T2D (HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin): 9.7Â±2%) were randomized to IMT, IMT+RYGB or IMT+SG and underwent a mixed-meal tolerance test at baseline, 12, and 24 months for evaluation of AG suppression (postprandial minus fasting) and beta-cell function (oral disposition index; glucose-stimulated insulin secretion Ã— Matsuda index). Total/android body fat (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) was also assessed. RYGB and SG reduced body fat comparably (15-23â€‰kg) at 12 and 24 months, whereas IMT had no effect. Beta-cell function increased 5.8-fold in RYGB and was greater than IMT at 24 months (P<0.001). However, there was no difference in insulin secretion between SG vs IMT at 24 months (P=0.32). Fasting AG was reduced fourfold following SG (P<0.01) and did not change with RYGB or IMT at 24 months. AG suppression improved more following RYGB than SG or IMT at 24 months (P=0.01 vs SG, P=0.07 vs IMT). At 24 months, AG suppression was associated with increased postprandial glucagon-like peptide-1 (r=-0.32, P<0.02) and decreased android fat (r=0.38; P<0.006). Enhanced AG suppression persists for up to 2 years after RYGB, and this effect is associated with decreased android obesity and improved insulin secretion. Together, these findings suggest that AG suppression is partly responsible for the improved glucose control after RYGB surgery.",10.1038/ijo.2013.196,,,,1038
1343,Laparoscopic duodenojejunal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy: preliminary results of a prospective series from India.,"Bariatric surgeries are now redefined as metabolic surgeries given the excellent resolution of metabolic derangements accompanying obesity. Duodenojejunal bypass (DJB) is a novel metabolic surgery based on foregut hypothesis. Reports describe DJB as a stand-alone procedure for the treatment of diabetes in nonobese subjects. For obese subjects, DJB is combined with sleeve gastrectomy. This combination of DJB and sleeve gastrectomy is proposed as an ideal alternative to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) with these advantages: (1) easy postoperative endoscopic surveillance, (2) preservation of the pyloric mechanism, which prevents dumping syndrome, and (3) reduced alimentary limb tension. This study aimed to analyze the short-term outcomes of laparoscopic DJB with sleeve gastrectomy for morbidly obese patients. At our institution, 38 patients who underwent laparoscopic DJB with sleeve gastrectomy were followed up. The inclusion criteria for the study were according to the Asian Pacific Bariatric Surgery Society guidelines. Sleeve gastrectomy was performed over a 36-Fr bougie, with the first part of the duodenum mobilized and transected. The jejunum was divided 50 cm distal to duodenojejunal flexure. A 75- to 150-cm alimentary limb was fashioned and brought in a retrocolic manner. End-to-end hand-sewn duodenojejunostomy was performed. Intestinal continuity was restored with a stapled jejunojejunostomy, and mesenteric rents were closed. The study population consisted of 38 patients (15 men and 23 women) ranging in age from 31 to 48 years. During a mean follow-up period of 17 months, the excess body weight loss was 72%, with a 92% resolution of diabetes. One patient presented with internal herniation through the retrocolic window 1 month after the operation and was managed surgically without any complication. No other minor or major complications occurred, and there was no mortality. Laparoscopic DJB with sleeve gastrectomy is safe and effective in achieving durable weight loss and excellent resolution of comorbidities. Long-term follow-up studies are needed.",10.1007/s00464-011-1938-0,,,,1039
446,Oral ingestion versus endoscopic delivery of endoscopic capsule in patients with previous gastrointestinal surgery (ORENCES study): A Spanish multicentre observational study.,"Small Bowel Capsule Endoscopy is the first-choice technique for investigating the majority of small bowel diseases. Its most common complications are related to incomplete examinations and capsule retention. There is no consensus on how patients with previous gastrointestinal surgery should receive the capsule. The primary endpoint was to compare the rate of complete small-bowel examinations (completion rate) between oral ingestion and endoscopic delivery of the capsule. The secondary endpoint was to compare diagnostic yield and adverse events in the two groups. A retrospective observational study was conducted in nine hospitals in Spain. Demographic data, previous surgery, indication for capsule endoscopy, intestinal transit time, diagnosis, completion rate (percentage of capsules reaching the caecum), diagnostic yield (percentage of results compatible with indication for the exam) and adverse events were collected. From January 2009 to May 2019 fifty-seven patients were included (39 male, mean age 66Â±15 years). The most common indications for the exam were ""overt"" (50.9%) and ""occult"" (35.1%) small bowel bleeding. Previous Billroth II gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were present in 52.6% and 17.5% of patients respectively. The capsule was swallowed in 34 patients and placed endoscopically in 23 patients. No significant differences were observed between the oral ingestion and endoscopic delivery groups in terms of completion rate (82.4% vs. 78.3%; p=0.742), diagnostic yield (41.2% vs. 52.2%; p=0.432) or small bowel transit time (301 vs. 377min, p=0.118). No capsule retention occurred. Only one severe adverse event (anastomotic perforation) was observed in the endoscopic delivery group. In our case series, there were no significant differences between oral ingestion and endoscopic delivery in terms of completion rate, diagnostic yield or safety. Being less invasive, oral ingestion of the capsule should be the first-choice method in patients with previous gastrointestinal surgery.",10.1016/j.gastrohep.2020.11.005,,,,1040
1105,Immediate enhancement of first-phase insulin secretion and unchanged glucose effectiveness in patients with type 2 diabetes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) in patients with type 2 diabetes often leads to early disease remission, and it is unknown to what extent this involves improved pancreatic Î²-cell function per se and/or enhanced insulin- and non-insulin-mediated glucose disposal (glucose effectiveness). We studied 30 obese patients, including 10 with type 2 diabetes, 8 with impaired glucose tolerance, and 12 with normal glucose tolerance before, 1 wk, and 3 mo after RYGB, using an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) to estimate first-phase insulin response, insulin sensitivity (Si), and glucose effectiveness with Bergman's minimal model. In the fasting state, insulin sensitivity was estimated by HOMA-S and Î²-cell function by HOMA-Î². Moreover, mixed-meal tests and oral GTTs were performed. In patients with type 2 diabetes, glucose levels normalized after RYGB, first-phase insulin secretion in response to iv glucose increased twofold, and HOMA-Î² already improved 1 wk postoperatively, with further enhancements at 3 mo. Insulin sensitivity increased in the liver (HOMA-S) at 1 wk and at 3 mo in peripheral tissues (Si), whereas glucose effectiveness did not improve significantly. During oral testing, GLP-1 responses and insulin secretion increased regardless of glucose tolerance. Therefore, in addition to increased insulin sensitivity and exaggerated postprandial GLP-1 levels, diabetes remission after RYGB involves early improvement of pancreatic Î²-cell function per se, reflected in enhanced first-phase insulin secretion to iv glucose and increased HOMA-Î². A major role for improved glucose effectiveness after RYGB was not supported by this study.",10.1152/ajpendo.00506.2014,,,,1041
1066,Comparison of Short- and Mid-term Efficacy and the Mechanisms of Gastric Bypass Surgeries on Managing Obese and Nonobese Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Prospective Study.,"We targeted to investigate the efficacy and the mechanisms of two gastric bypass surgeries, Roux-en-y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) and Billroth II gastrojejunostomy on managing obese patients with T2DM and nonobese T2DM patients, respectively. Seven nonobese T2DM patients with gastric cancer submitted to Billroth II gastrojejunostomy were compared with nine obese T2DM patients undergoing RYGB about their baseline characteristics, weight loss and glycemic control, 3 months and 2 years after surgery. Meanwhile, Î²-cell function, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) levels were also investigated. Significant weight loss and improvement of glycemic control were observed in both groups and in the two follow-up periods. Reduction of body mass index was greater in obese patients with T2DM. The efficacy of Billroth II gastrojejunostomy on controlling blood glucose of nonobese T2DM was similar to that of RYGB on managing obese T2DM. Insulin levels and HOMA-IR were decreased in obese T2DM patients, whereas they remained unchanged in nonobese T2DM patients. Generally, levels of GLP-1 and PYY were increased, whereas GIP levels were decreased in both groups. Glycemic control efficacy of Billroth II gastrojejunostomy on managing nonobese T2DM is similar to that of RYGB on treating obese T2DM in the short- and mid-term. The underlying mechanisms of both surgeries may be related to weight loss and gut hormone modulations.",10.1016/j.arcmed.2015.06.003,,,,1042
987,Corticosteroids or Not for Postoperative Nausea: A Double-Blinded Randomized Study.,"Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is common after general anaesthesia, and corticosteroids are used in many protocols for enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS). However, surgical techniques are developing, and ERAS protocols need to be reevaluated from time to time. In this study, we compared the effects of oral vs. parenteral corticosteroid administration on postoperative nausea. Elective Roux-y-gastric bypass (RYGB) patients were randomly assigned to either 8Â mg betamethasone orally (nâ€‰=â€‰50) or parentally (nâ€‰=â€‰25) or as controls (nâ€‰=â€‰25), in a double-blind design. PONV risk factors were noted. All patients had the same anaesthetic technique. Data were collected at baseline, on arrival to the recovery room (RR) and at five more time points during the first 24Â h. Nausea and tiredness were patient assessed using visual analogue scales; rescue drug consumption was recorded. Operation time was 30-40Â min. Neither demographics nor risk factors for nausea differed between groups. Neither peak values for nor total amount of nausea differed between groups. The number of supplemental injections was the same for all groups. In a setting of modern laparoscopic RYGB, the value of betamethasone in preventing PONV seems to be limited. ERAS protocols may need re-evaluation.",10.1007/s11605-016-3166-3,,,,1043
1638,Treatment of morbid obesity with adjustable gastric band: preliminary report.,"The goal of surgery for morbid obesity is to achieve a good and durable loss of weight and improve health. Previous studies have demonstrated a significant weight loss for the Swedish adjustable gastric band (SAGB). Between November 1996 and April 1998, 18 morbidly obese patients underwent SAGB laparoscopically. Their mean age at surgery was 35 years. The mean preoperative weight was 128 kg (range 89-163), and the mean body mass index was 50.4+/-9. Comorbidity was present in 13 patients. One gastric perforation occurred, and in one patient it was not possible to create the pneumoperitoneum. Regarding late morbidity, one intragastric migration and one slippage of the band occurred. There was no mortality. The low morbidity, the good results with weight loss, and the improvement in comorbidity lead the authors to believe that Swedish adjustable gastric banding for the treatment of morbidly obese patients is a successful means of losing weight and improving general health.",10.1381/096089299765553494,,,,1044
1478,Early changes in postprandial gallbladder emptying in morbidly obese patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: correlation with the occurrence of biliary sludge and gallstones.,"Gallstones have been frequently diagnosed after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP). Gallbladder stasis associated with duodenal exclusion may play a role in their pathogenesis. Gallbladder emptying was studied before and on the 30th and 31st postoperative days (POD) after RYGBP in 20 morbidly obese patients. Gallbladder volume after fasting and every 15 min during a 2-h period following administration of a standard liquid meal was determined by sonography. On the 31st POD, the meal was administered through the gastrostomy in order to promote its transit through the duodenum. Fasting volume (FV), maximum ejection fraction (Max EF), and residual volume (RV) were determined. Biliary sludge and calculi were investigated after 1 and 6 months, respectively. FV was 39.4 +/- 20.2 ml, 50.1 +/- 22.7 ml, and 47.9 +/- 23.4 ml, respectively, for the preoperative and two postoperative assessments (P = 0.09). RV was 7.6 +/- 8.7 ml, 25.1 +/- 20.0 ml, and 24.6 +/- 20.9 ml; and Max EF was 80.5 +/- 20.9%, 54.3 +/- 21.4%, and 50.5 +/- 29.0%, respectively, for the pre-, postoral, and postgastrostomy infusion measurements. There was only a significant difference between the preoperative value and the two postoperative values (P < 0.001). Biliary sludge was detected in 65% of the patients and 46% of them subsequently developed gallstones. Gallbladder emptying became significantly compromised after RYGBP. This impairment was unrelated to duodenal exclusion but it was associated with biliary sludge and stone formation.",10.1007/s11695-008-9648-y,,,,1045
1023,Bariatric surgery improves female pelvic floor disorders.,"Obesity aggravates pelvic floor disorders in women. Weight loss improves these disorders. The purpose of this study was to assess the evolution of pelvic floor disorders in women who have undergone bariatric surgery. A prospective single-center study was conducted from December 2012 to February 2014. The parameters studied were diabetes, BMI, excess weight loss, multiparity, mode of delivery and their relation to obesity and pelvic floor disorders. We evaluated anorectal and urethral sphincter disorders using the PFDI-20 questionnaire preoperatively, at 1 month and then every 6 months thereafter. One hundred and sixteen patients underwent bariatric surgery. Seventy questionnaires were completed preoperatively and postoperatively. Weight loss was significant with an excess weight loss of 57.1%. The mean body mass index (BMI) decreased from 44.5 Â± 6.31 kg/m(2) (range: 35.0-63.23) to 31.83 Â± 5.83 kg/m(2) (range: 20.9-49.6). The average length of follow-up was 11.3 Â± 5.2 months (range: 5-25). The incidence of urinary symptoms improved after surgery (P=0.003), as did the UDI-6 score (Urogenital distress inventory) (P=0.009). There was no improvement in other symptoms such as prolapse and colorectal-anal dysfunction. The prevalence of pelvic floor disorders is high among obese women; in this study, colorectal disorders were present in 53% and urinary disorders in 71.5%. Bariatric surgery-induced weight loss led to improvement in urinary continence disorders when assessed over an average follow-up of 11 months.",10.1016/j.jviscsurg.2015.11.011,,,,1046
1653,Changes in patients' taste acuity after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for clinically severe obesity.,"Patients who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) for clinically severe obesity often report an aversion to sweet foods and meat. This study was designed to determine whether changes in taste acuity occur after RYGB. This prospective, repeated measures trial evaluated acuity for sweet (sucrose) and bitter (urea) tastes, zinc status, and reported changes in taste perceptions in patients undergoing RYGB for weight reduction. Taste acuity and serum zinc level were measured in 14 subjects, 6 men and 8 women (mean preoperative body mass index [calculated as kg/m2] = 60.8 +/- 11.8 and mean age = 38.4 +/- 6 years), before surgery and 6 and 12 weeks after surgery. Inquiries regarding taste preferences were made at each postoperative visit with specific reference to sweets and meat. Serum zinc level was measured at the same visit. A noncontrolled comparison group of 4 subjects who were consuming a very-low-calorie diet also underwent taste acuity testing at similar intervals. The main outcome measures were recognition taste thresholds, serum zinc levels, and taste preference changes. Analysis of variance with repeated measures over time, Pearson correlation coefficients, and post hoc analysis of variance were used to analyze data. Mean recognition thresholds for sucrose were 0.047 +/- 0.03 mol/L preoperatively and fell significantly to 0.024 +/- 0.01 and 0.019 +/- 0.01 mol/L at 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively, respectively. Overall, there were no significant differences in taste thresholds for urea over time; a significant difference was noted, however, in the pattern of change for urea between patients who reported an aversion to meats and those who did not. Zinc concentrations did not change during the study. At 6 weeks postoperatively, all patients reported that foods tasted sweeter, and they modified food selection accordingly. Six patients reported an aversion to meats associated with increased nausea and vomiting. Acuity for sweet and bitter tastes may need to be considered when planning dietary modifications for patients undergoing RYGB.",10.1016/S0002-8223(95)00182-4,,,,1047
122,Monitoring for micronutrient deficiency after bariatric surgery-what is the risk?,"Bariatric surgery may increase the risk of micronutrient deficiencies; however, confounders including preoperative deficiency, supplementation and inflammation are rarely considered. To examine the impact of bariatric surgeries, supplementation and inflammation on micronutrient deficiency. Two public hospitals, Australia. Participants were recruited to an observational study monitoring biochemical micronutrient outcomes, supplementation dose, inflammation and glycaemic control, pre-operatively and at 1-3, 6 and 12 months after gastric bypass (GB; Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Single Anastomosis Gastric Bypass; Nâ€‰=â€‰66) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG; Nâ€‰=â€‰144). Participant retention at 12 months was 81%. Pre-operative micronutrient deficiency was common, for vitamin D (29-30%), iron (13-22%) and selenium (39% GB cohort). Supplement intake increased after surgery; however, dose was <50% of target for most nutrients. After SG, folate was vulnerable to deficiency at 6 months (OR 13 [95% CI 2, 84]; pâ€‰=â€‰0.007), with folic acid supplementation being independently associated with reduced risk. Within 1-3 months of GB, three nutrients had higher deficiency rates compared to pre-operative levels; vitamin B1 (21% vs. 6%, pâ€‰<â€‰0.01), vitamin A (21% vs. 3%, pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) and selenium (59% vs. 39%, pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Vitamin B1 deficiency was independently associated with surgery and inflammation, selenium deficiency with improved glycaemic control after surgery and inflammation, whilst vitamin A deficiency was associated with inflammation only. In the setting of prophylactic post-surgical micronutrient prescription, few nutrients are at risk of de novo deficiency. Although micronutrient supplementation and monitoring remains important, rationalising high-frequency biochemical testing protocols in the first year after surgery may be warranted.",10.1038/s41430-023-01318-3,,,,1048
1094,Patients lacking sustainable long-term weight loss after gastric bypass surgery show signs of decreased inhibitory control of prepotent responses.,"A considerable number of bariatric patients report poor long-term weight loss after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. One possibility for an underlying cause is an impairment of cognitive control that impedes this patient group's dietary efforts. To investigate if patients having either poor or good weight loss response, ~12 years after RYGB-surgery, differ in their ability to inhibit prepotent responses when processing food cues during attentional operations-as measure of cognitive control. In terms of weight loss following RYGB-surgery, 15 'poor responders' and 15 'good responders', matched for gender, age, education, preoperative body mass index, and years since surgery, were administered two tasks that measure sustained attention and response control: a go/no-go task and a Stroop interference task; both of which are associated with maladaptive eating behaviours. The poor responders (vs. good responders) needed significantly more time when conducting a go/no-go task (603Â±134 vs. 519Â±44 msec, p = 0.03), but the number of errors did not differ between groups. When conducting a Stroop interference task, poor responders read fewer inks than good responders (68Â±16 vs. 85Â±10 words, p = 0.002). Patients lacking sustainable weight loss after RYGB-surgery showed poorer inhibitory control than patients that successfully lost weight. In the authors' view, these results suggest that cognitive behavioral therapies post-RYGB-surgery may represent a promising behavioral adjuvant to achieve sustainable weight loss in patients undergoing this procedure. Future studies should examine whether these control deficits in poor responders are food-specific or not.",10.1371/journal.pone.0119896,,,,1049
600,Biliopancreatic Diversion Induces Greater Metabolic Improvement Than Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.,"Diabetes remission is greater after biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) than Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. We used a mixed-meal test with ingested and infused glucose tracers and the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure with glucose tracer infusion to assess the effect of 20% weight loss induced by either RYGB or BPD on glucoregulation in people with obesity (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT03111953). The rate of appearance of ingested glucose into the circulation was much slower, and the postprandial increases in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were markedly blunted after BPD compared to after RYGB. Insulin sensitivity, assessed as glucose disposal rate during insulin infusion, was âˆ¼45% greater after BPD than RYGB, whereas Î² cell function was not different between groups. These results demonstrate thatÂ compared with matched-percentage weight loss induced by RYGB, BPD has unique beneficial effects on glycemic control, manifested by slower postprandial glucose absorption, blunted postprandial plasma glucose and insulin excursions, and greater improvement in insulin sensitivity.",10.1016/j.cmet.2019.09.002,,,,1050
377,Effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships of liquid and controlled-release formulations of oxycodone.,"The physiological changes following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery may impact drug release from mechanistically different controlled-release tablets, making generic substitution inappropriate. This study aimed to characterise the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships of oxycodone from a lipid-based and water-swellable controlled-release tablet in RYGB patients. Twenty RYGB patients received 10-mg oral solution oxycodone or 20-mg controlled-release (water-swellable or lipid-based) oxycodone in a three-way, randomised, semiblinded and cross-over study. Blood sampling and pupillary recordings were conducted over a 24-h period. A previously established pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of these three formulations in healthy volunteers was used in the analysis as a reference model. No differences in absorption kinetics were seen between controlled-release formulations in patients. However, the absorption lag time was 11.5â€‰min in patients vs 14â€‰min in healthy volunteers for controlled-release tablets (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Furthermore, oral bioavailability was 14.4% higher in patients compared to healthy volunteers regardless of formulation type (Pâ€‰<Â 0.001). Oxycodone pharmacodynamics were not significantly affected by formulation or patient status. However, baseline pupil diameter was inversely correlated with age (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and plasma concentrations of oxycodone at half-maximum effect were 31% lower in males compared to females (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Generic substitution of monophasic lipid-based and water-swellable controlled-release oxycodone tablets may be considered safe in RYGB patients.",10.1111/bcpt.13634,,,,1051
1113,Improvements in glucose metabolism early after gastric bypass surgery are not explained by increases in total bile acids and fibroblast growth factor 19 concentrations.,"Bile acids and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) have been suggested as key mediators of the improvements in glucose metabolism after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). To describe fasting and postprandial state total bile acid (TBA) and FGF19 concentrations before and after RYGB and relate them to parameters of glucose metabolism, glucagon-like peptide-1, cholecystokinin, and cholesterol fractions. A prospective descriptive study was performed at the Department of Endocrinology, Hvidovre Hospital, Hvidovre, Denmark. Thirteen type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients and 12 normal glucose tolerant (NGT) subjects participated in the study. A 4-hour liquid meal test was performed before and 1 week, 3 months, and 1 year after RYGB. We measured fasting and postprandial TBA and FGF19 concentrations. Fasting TBA concentrations decreased in NGT subjects (P < .001) and were unchanged in T2D patients 1 week after surgery, but then increased gradually in both groups with time from surgery (ANOVA Ptime < .001). Area under the curve (AUC) TBA was decreased in NGT subjects 1 week after RYGB (before surgery, 567 mmol * min/L [interquartile range, 481-826]; 1 wk, 419 [381-508]; P = .009) and was unchanged in T2D patients (894 [573-1002]; 695 [349-1147]; P = .97) but then increased with time from surgery in both groups (Ptime < .001). Fasting FGF19 concentrations were unchanged acutely after RYGB (NGT, 140 pg/mL [100-162], 134 [119-204], P = .42; T2D, 162 [130-196], 154 [104-164], P = .68) and remained unchanged throughout the follow-up period. AUC FGF19 increased gradually with time after surgery (Ptime < .001), resembling the changes seen with AUC TBA. One week after RYGB, glucose metabolism improved, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol decreased, and cholecystokinin and glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion increased, whereas FFA concentrations were unchanged. TBA and FGF19 do not explain acute changes in glucose metabolism, cholesterol fractions, and gut hormone secretion after RYGB.",10.1210/jc.2014-1658,,,,1052
527,Closure versus non-closure of mesenteric defects in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The comparative evidence regarding the outcomes of closure versus non-closure of mesenteric defects in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is poorly understood. We aimed to compare the outcomes of closure versus non-closure of mesenteric defects in LRYGB for morbid obesity. We conducted a search of electronic information sources to identify all comparative studies investigating the outcomes of closure versus non-closure of mesenteric defects in patients undergoing LRYGB for morbid obesity. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the ROBINS-I tool to assess the risk of bias of RCTs and observational studies, respectively. Random or fixed effects modelling was applied as appropriate. We included 10,031 patients from six observational studies and 2609 patients from two RCTs. Analysis of observational studies showed closure defects resulted in lower risks of internal hernia (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15, 0.54) and reoperation for small bowel obstruction (SBO) (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10, 0.83); no difference was found between the two groups in terms of SBO not related to internal hernia (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.47, 2.99), early SBO (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.04, 14.38), anastomotic leak (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.45, 1.57), bleeding (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.62, 1.89), and anastomotic ulcer (OR 2.08, 95% CI 0.62, 6.94). Analysis of RCTs showed closure of defects resulted in lower risks of internal hernia (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.19,0.45) and reoperation for SBO (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.38, 0.69) but higher risks of SBO not related to internal hernia (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.09, 3.34) and early SBO (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.16, 5.96); no difference was found between the two groups in terms of anastomotic leak (OR 1.95, 95% CI 0.80, 4.72), bleeding (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.38, 1.17), and anastomotic ulcer (OR 2.08, 95% CI 0.62, 6.94). Our results suggest that closure of mesenteric defects in LRYGB may be associated with lower risks of internal herniation and reoperation for SBO compared with non-closure of the defects (moderate certainty). The available evidence is inconclusive regarding the risks of SBO not related to internal hernia and early SBO (low certainty). More RCTs are needed to improve the robustness of the available evidence.",10.1007/s00464-020-07544-1,,,,1053
1515,Entero-endocrine changes after gastric bypass in diabetic and nondiabetic patients: a preliminary study.,"Alterations in entero-endocrine signaling may play a role in improvements in satiety and glucose tolerance after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). We report our findings of gut hormone secretion in a cohort of diabetic and nondiabetic morbidly obese patients. Ten morbidly obese subjects who underwent uncomplicated RYGB were studied: 5 were diabetic and 9 were female. Nonfasting plasma levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), insulin, desacyl ghrelin, active ghrelin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) were determined preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. Mean patient age was 42 +/- 11 years, and the mean preoperative body mass index was 50 +/- 6 kg/m(2). At 6 months mean BMI fell to 33 +/- 5 kg/m(2) (P < 0.0001), and there were no differences between diabetics and nondiabetics with respect to amount of weight loss. In non-diabetics, compared to preoperative levels, there were significant increases in GLP-1 and desacyl-ghrelin in the nondiabetic patients (P = 0.046 and P = 0.016, respectively); no change in plasma insulin, active ghrelin, NPY, or GIP was demonstrated. In contrast, when compared to preoperative levels, there were no significant changes in entero-endocrine hormone levels in the diabetic cohort postoperatively. At 6 months postoperation, RYGB significantly alters the hormone levels for GLP-1 and desacyl-ghrelin in morbidly obese nondiabetic patients. No significant change was noted in a matched cohort of diabetic patients. Weight loss was similar in diabetics and nondiabetics, suggesting that GLP-1 and ghrelin are not the only mechanisms producing weight loss after RYGB.",10.1016/j.jss.2007.02.022,,,,1054
661,Changes in Thyroid Replacement Therapy after Bariatric Surgery: Differences between Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy.,"Levothyroxine (LT4) requirements can presumably be modified differently after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). The present study compared changes in LT4 dose in hypothyroid subjects undergoing LRYGB or LSG 2Â years after the procedure. A 2-year follow-up observational study was conducted in a prospective cohort of obese patients who had undergone bariatric surgery and were receiving LT4. Indication for the type of surgical procedure was based on clinical criteria. Repeated measures ANOVA models were used to examine differences within and between groups. Thirty-five consecutive patients were included for analysis: 22 LRYGB and 13 LSG. Total daily LT4 dosage decreased in the LSG group (133.7â€‰Â±â€‰50.3Â mcg/day at baseline to 104.3â€‰Â±â€‰43.3Â mcg/day at 2Â years; pÂ =â€‰0.047) whereas it remained stable in the LRYGB group (129.5â€‰Â±â€‰46.1Â mcg/day at baseline to 125.2â€‰Â±â€‰55.7Â mcg/day at 2Â years; pÂ =â€‰1.000). Differences between groups became significant at 24Â months. Daily weight-based LT4 dose increased in the LRYGB group (1.11â€‰Â±â€‰0.38Â mcg/kgÂ day at baseline to 1.57â€‰Â±â€‰0.74Â mcg/kgÂ day at 2Â years; pÂ =â€‰0.005) with no significant changes in the LSG group (1.15â€‰Â±â€‰0.35Â mcg/kgÂ day at baseline vs 1.11â€‰Â±â€‰0.49Â mcg/kgÂ day at 2Â years; pÂ =â€‰1.000). LRYGB and LSG showed different changes in LT4 requirements 2Â years after surgery. There was an early decrease in daily total LT4 dose requirements after LSG, which suggests an early preventive reduction to be validated in future studies.",10.1007/s11695-019-03890-9,,,,1055
1414,"Potential additional effect of omentectomy on metabolic syndrome, acute-phase reactants, and inflammatory mediators in grade III obese patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a randomized trial.","To assess the additional effect of sudden visceral fat reduction by omentectomy on metabolic syndrome, acute-phase reactants, and inflammatory mediators in patients with grade III obesity (G-III O) undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). Twenty-two patients were randomized into two groups, LRYGB alone or with omentectomy. Levels of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, leptin, adiponectin, glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, as well as clinical characteristics, were evaluated before surgery and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Results were compared between groups. Baseline characteristics were comparable in both groups. Mean operative time was significantly higher in the group of patients who underwent omentectomy (P < 0.001). Median weight of the omentum was 795 +/- 341 g. In one patient, a duodenal perforation occurred at the time of omentectomy. BMI, blood pressure, glucose, total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides significantly improved in both groups at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up when compared with basal values. However, there were no consistent statistically significant differences among the groups in terms of metabolic syndrome components, acute-phase reactants, and inflammatory mediators. Omentectomy does not have an ancillary short-term significant impact on the components of metabolic syndrome and does not induce important changes in the inflammatory mediators in patients undergoing LRYGB. Operative time is more prolonged when omentectomy is performed.",10.2337/dc09-1833,,,,1056
1609,Body composition assessment in extreme obesity and after massive weight loss induced by gastric bypass surgery.,"Body composition methods were examined in 20 women [body mass index (BMI) 48.7 +/- 8.8 kg/m(2)] before and after weight loss [-44.8 +/- 14.6 (SD) kg] after gastric bypass (GBP) surgery. The reference method, a three-compartment (3C) model using body density by air displacement plethysmography and total body water (TBW) by H(2)18O dilution (3C-H(2)18O), showed a decrease in percent body fat (%BF) from 51.4 to 34.6%. Fat-free mass hydration was significantly higher than the reference value (0.738) in extreme obesity (0.756; P < 0.001) but not after weight reduction (0.747; P = 0.16). %BF by H(2)18O dilution and air displacement plethysmography differed significantly from %BF by 3C-H(2)18O in extreme obesity (P < 0.05) and 3C models using (2)H(2)O or bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to determine TBW improved mean %BF estimates over most other methods at both time points. BIA results varied with the equation used, but BIA better predicted %BF than did BMI at both time points. All methods except BIA using the Segal equation were comparable to the reference method for determining changes over time. A simple 3C model utilizing air displacement plethysmography and BIA is useful for clinical evaluation in this population.",10.1152/ajpendo.00185.2002,,,,1057
1602,Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding for massive superobesity ( > 60 body mass index kg/m2).,"Surgery for massive super obesity is a formidable challenge. No existing open or laparoscopic procedure reduces BMI below 30 from a starting point above 55. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding has been used to treat 76 massive super obese patients with a BMI > 60 kgs/m2. Median weight was 193 kgs +/-34.7 kgs (154-335 kgs). Five patients had a BMI > 100 kgs/m2. There was neither mortality nor pulmonary emboli. hospital stay was 3 days (1-6 days). Excess weight loss was 46.69 +/-10.5 at 1 year; 59.14 +/- 11.7% at 3 years and 61 +/- 15.1% at 5 years. At 2 years, 84% of the patients had greater than 50% excess weight loss and this was maintained at 3, 4, and 5 years. BMI fell from 69 +/- 6.2 to 49 +/- 7.73 at 1 year to 37 +/- 4.45 at 3 years and this was maintained at 4 and 5 years. BMI in 13 patients with > 5 year follow up was 35.09 +/- 53 kgs/m2 (27-44). Weight loss with laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding in this group of massive super obese patients has been similar to all other surgical techniques with reduction of BMI from 69 to 33 kgs/m2 at 3 years. The relative safety of the Lapband avoids bowel surgery in these very big patients, suggesting that laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding is a valid surgical approach to these difficult patients.",10.1007/s00464-002-8921-8,,,,1058
1369,Effect of bariatric surgery on sulphur amino acids and glutamate.,"Plasma total cysteine (tCys) concentrations are associated with BMI. To study the relationship between tCys and BMI, we monitored the changes in serum concentrations of tCys and metabolically related compounds in sixty obese patients (BMI 50-60 kg/m(2)) from before to 1 year after either gastric bypass surgery (mean 30 % weight loss) or duodenal switch surgery (mean 41 % weight loss). A total of fifty-eight healthy persons (BMI 17-31 kg/m(2)) served as controls. Before surgery, obese patients had modestly (approximately 17 %) higher mean serum tCys, and markedly (>2-fold) higher glutamate concentrations, than controls (P â‰¤ 0Â·001 for both). Serial examinations after surgery revealed that gastric bypass patients had no change in tCys concentrations (P = 0Â·22), while duodenal switch patients showed a modest (approximately 12 %) but significant decrease in tCys (P < 0Â·001). Total homocysteine concentrations increased in duodenal switch patients but not in gastric bypass patients. Independent of surgery type, serum concentrations of methionine and cystathionine decreased (P < 0Â·05 for both), while serum glutathione and taurine remained stable. Glutamate concentrations declined, as did Î³-glutamyltransferase activity (P < 0Â·001 for both). These results show that despite 30 % weight loss, and decreases in methionine, cystathionine and glutamate, there was no significant change in serum tCys in patients after gastric bypass surgery. The decrease in tCys in patients undergoing duodenal switch could be related to malabsorption. The present findings do not suggest that BMI is a causal determinant of plasma tCys.",10.1017/S0007114511000201,,,,1059
955,Consequences of Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth in Obese Patients Before and After Bariatric Surgery.,"Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) has been described in obese patients. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the prevalence and consequences of SIBO in obese patients before and after bariatric surgery. From October 2001 to July 2009, in obese patients referred for bariatric surgery (BMI >40Â kg/m2 or >35 in association with comorbidities), a glucose hydrogen (H2) breath test (BT) was performed before and/or after either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) or adjustable gastric banding (AGB) to assess the presence of SIBO. Weight loss and serum vitamin concentrations were measured after bariatric surgery while a multivitamin supplement was systematically given. Three hundred seventy-eight (meanÂ Â±Â SD) patients who performed a BT before and/or after surgery were included: before surgery, BT was positive in 15.4Â % (55/357). After surgery, BT was positive in 10 % (2/20) of AGB and 40 % (26/65) of RYGBP (p < 0.001 compared to preoperative situation). After RYGBP, patients with positive BT had similar vitamin levels, a lower caloric intake (983Â Â±Â 337 vs. 1271Â Â±Â 404Â kcal/day, pÂ =Â 0.014) but a significant lower weight loss (29.7Â Â±Â 5.6 vs. 37.7Â Â±Â 12.9Â kg, pÂ =Â 0.002) and lower percent of total weight loss (25.6Â Â±Â 6.0 vs. 29.2Â Â±Â 6.9Â %, pÂ =Â 0.044). In this study, SIBO is present in 15Â % of obese patients before bariatric surgery. This prevalence does not increase after AGB while it rises up to 40Â % of patients after RYGBP and it is associated with lower weight loss.",10.1007/s11695-016-2343-5,,,,1060
1146,Effects of intensive lifestyle intervention and gastric bypass on aortic stiffness: a 1-year nonrandomized clinical study.,"To compare the long-term effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GBS) and intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) on aortic stiffness. Nonrandomized clinical trial. Aortic stiffness was assessed by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf PWV) using high-fidelity applanation tonometry. A total of 159 treatment-seeking morbidly obese patients were included, 82 (54 females) in the GBS-group and 77 (48 females) in the ILI-group. Participants in the GBS-group were younger (42.0â€‰Â±â€‰9.9 vs. 46.4â€‰Â±â€‰10.5 years), heavier (BMI 45.7â€‰Â±â€‰5.3 vs. 42.0â€‰Â±â€‰4.9 kg/m(2) ), and had lower systolic pressure (137â€‰Â±â€‰19 vs. 145â€‰Â±â€‰18 mm Hg) and pulse pressure (57â€‰Â±â€‰16 vs. 65â€‰Â±â€‰17 mm Hg), all Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.006. Mean (SD) cf PWV at baseline was 8.6â€‰Â±â€‰1.7 m/s in the GBS-group and 8.6â€‰Â±â€‰1.9 m/s in the ILI-group, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.959. At follow-up, mean (95% CI) weight loss was larger in the GBS-group than in the ILI-group -43.3 (-46.0 to -40.7) vs. -12.1 (-14.6 to -9.6) kg, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001. The mean change in cf PWV was -0.02 (-0.31 to 0.27) m/s in the GBS-group and 0.03 (-0.28 to 0.33) m/s in the ILI-group, both Pâ€‰â‰¥â€‰0.412; adjusted between-group difference (ANCOVA) 0.05 (-0.40 to 0.49) m/s, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.836. The adjusted regression analysis showed that weight loss was associated with increased cf PWV in the GBS-group. GBS and ILI had no significant long-term effects on aortic stiffness in treatment-seeking morbidly obese individuals.",10.1002/oby.20880,,,,1061
710,Impact of Bariatric Surgery on the Pharmacokinetics Parameters of Amoxicillin.,"Bariatric surgery leads to several anatomo-physiological modifications that may affect pharmacokinetic parameters and consequently alter the therapeutic effect of drugs, such as antibiotics. The pharmacokinetics of oral amoxicillin after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery is unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of bariatric surgery on the pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin. This study was performed as a randomized, open-label, single-dose clinical trial, with two periods of treatment, in which obese subjects (nâ€‰=â€‰8) received an amoxicillin 500Â mg capsule orally before and 2Â months after the RYGB surgery. The amoxicillin plasma concentration was determined by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). After the surgery, the mean weight loss was 17.03â€‰Â±â€‰5.51Â kg, and mean body mass index (BMI) decreased from 46.21â€‰Â±â€‰2.82 to 38.82â€‰Â±â€‰3.32Â kg/m2. The mean amoxicillin area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC0-tlast) increased significantly (3.5-fold); the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) increased 2.8-fold after the bariatric surgery. No correlation was found between amoxicillin absorption, BMI, and weight loss percentage. The alterations observed in the amoxicillin pharmacokinetics suggest that obese subjects included in this trial had a substantially increase in amoxicillin systemic exposure after RYGB surgery. However, despite this increase, its exposure was lower than the values reported for non-obese volunteers. Identifiers: NCT03588273.",10.1007/s11695-018-3591-3,,,,1062
1286,"Bariatric surgery and endometrial pathology in asymptomatic morbidly obese women: a prospective, pilot study.","To determine the prevalence of occult uterine pathology in asymptomatic, morbidly obese women before and after bariatric surgery-induced weight loss. Prospective, blinded, non-interventional cohort. Urban teaching hospital. Morbidly obese women. Endometrial biopsies were obtained at the time of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and again 1Â year later. Both the patient and the physician were blinded to the results of the initial biopsy until the conclusion of the study. Specimens were independently reviewed by two blinded pathologists. Effect of bariatric surgery-induced weight loss on the prevalence of endometrial pathology at 1 year. Fifty-nine women underwent an endometrial biopsy during bariatric surgery. The mean (range) age, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were 42Â years (22-62Â years), 127Â kg (87-176Â kg), and 46.8Â kg/m(2) (36-64.3Â kg/m(2) ), respectively. Four women had hyperplasia (three simple and one complex), for an overall prevalence of 6.8%. The prevalence among women not receiving some anti-estrogen therapy was 9.5%. Forty-six women (78%) underwent follow-up biopsy after a mean (range) weight loss of 42Â kg (19-67Â kg). Simple hyperplasia was identified in 3/46 women at the 1-year follow-up (6.5%). Two women had resolution of hyperplasia, two women had persistent, simple hyperplasia, and one had had a normal initial biopsy. No woman showed progressive pathology or cancer. At the end of the follow-up all but one patient had a documented resolution of endometrial pathology. Asymptomatic morbidly obese women are at relatively high risk of harbouring occult endometrial hyperplasia. Bariatric surgery-associated weight loss reduced but did not eliminate this risk for endometrial pathology.",10.1111/1471-0528.12100,,,,1063
893,Weight Loss and Heart Failure: A Nationwide Study of Gastric Bypass Surgery Versus Intensive Lifestyle Treatment.,"Associations of obesity with incidence of heart failure have been observed, but the causality is uncertain. We hypothesized that gastric bypass surgery leads to a lower incidence of heart failure compared with intensive lifestyle modification in obese people. We included obese people without previous heart failure from a Swedish nationwide registry of people treated with a structured intensive lifestyle program and the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry. All analyses used inverse probability weights based on baseline body mass index and a propensity score estimated from baseline variables. Treatment groups were well balanced in terms of weight, body mass index, and most potential confounders. Associations of treatment with heart failure incidence, as defined in the National Patient Register, were analyzed with Cox regression. The 25â€‰804 gastric bypass surgery patients had on average lost 18.8 kg more weight after 1 year and 22.6 kg more after 2 years than the 13â€‰701 lifestyle modification patients. During a median of 4.1 years, surgery patients had lower heart failure incidence than lifestyle modification patients (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.82). A 10-kg achieved weight loss after 1 year was related to a hazard ratio for heart failure of 0.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.97) in both treatment groups combined. Results were robust in sensitivity analyses. Gastric bypass surgery was associated with approximately one half the incidence of heart failure compared with intensive lifestyle modification in this study of 2 large nationwide registries. We also observed a graded association between increasing weight loss and decreasing risk of heart failure.",10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.025629,,,,1064
1001,Comparative physiogenomic analyses of weight loss in response to 2 modes of bariatric surgery: demonstration with candidate neuropsychiatric and cardiometabolic genes.,"Surgical weight loss response is variable, with suboptimal outcomes in some patients. We hypothesized that genetic biomarkers may be related to weight change. We tested 330 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes relevant to metabolic regulation in 161 patients whose decrease in body mass index (BMI), 1 year after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), was small (lowest quartile response) or large (highest quartile response). LAGB patients whose BMI decreasedâ‰¤4.7 orâ‰¥10.2 units comprised groups I (n = 43) and II (n = 40), respectively. RYGB patients whose BMI decreasedâ‰¤13.6 orâ‰¥19.8 units comprised groups III (n = 39) and IV (n = 39), respectively. Within each surgery, SNPs with large differences in reference allele frequency (z score>2, corresponding to values displaced 2 standard deviations [SD] from the mean for all SNPs) in low versus high quartiles, were identified. We compared reference allele frequencies, within surgical procedure, using the Ï‡(2) test (using Bonferroni correction for multiple testing). The mean percent excess weight losses (Â±SD) corresponding to groups I, II, III, and IV were: 16 (Â±12), 64 (Â±30), 55 (Â±16), and 75 (Â±17), respectively. SNPs with z score>2 were identified in genes involved in LAGB response, lipid metabolic regulation (APOE, rs439401; APOC4, rs2288911), neural processes (DRD3, rs167771; HTR3 B, rs3758987), and xeno- or endobiotic metabolism (CYP3 A4, rs12333983); and for RYGB response, in lipid transport (SCARB1, rs10846744), folate metabolism (MTHFR, rs2066470), regulation of glycolysis in immune cells (HIF1 A, rs1951795), vitamin K cycling (VKORC1, rs2359612), and xeno- or endobiotic metabolism (CYP3 A4, rs2242480). For LAGB response, APOE SNP frequencies were significantly different. With further validation, information derived from patient DNA may be useful to predict surgical weight loss outcomes and guide selection of surgical approach.",10.1016/j.soard.2015.09.019,,,,1065
911,Gastrointestinal phytobezoar following bariatric surgery: Systematic review.,"Bezoars are collections of undigested foreign material that accumulate in the gastrointestinal tract. The most common are phytobezoars, which are formed from plant fibers, especially those related to the ingestion of persimmon. Patients who undergo abdominal surgery, including bariatric surgery for obesity, and particularly gastrectomy, are prone to bezoar formation due to reduced gastric motility, loss of pyloric function, and hypoacidity. Bezoars can form months to years postoperatively. Our objective was to review the published literature regarding phytobezoar formation after bariatric surgery. We investigated the entire scientific literature on phytobezoars as a complication after bariatric surgery using PubMed and Embase searches of all reports published to date. We used the following keywords: ""phytobezoars"" or ""bezoars"" and ""bariatric surgery"" or ""laparoscopic adjustable gastric band"" or ""laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy"" or ""Roux-en-Y gastric bypass"" or ""single anastomosis gastric bypass"" or ""biliopancreatic diversion."" Seventeen eligible articles were included in the study. We provide an overview of the incidence, classification, and manifestations of bezoar formation as a rare, late morbidity of bariatric surgery. Treatment options include chemical enzyme therapy, endoscopic dissolution and removal, or surgery. Nutritional counseling regarding bezoar formation and prevention of recurrence after bariatric surgery should emphasize changing eating habits, including sufficient drinking and chewing and avoiding the overindulgence of foods with high-fiber content, especially citrus pith and persimmons. Clinicians should be aware of this potential rare complication. Additional studies are needed to examine the eating habits and food choices of bariatric patients with bezoar complications and to elucidate more clearly the risk factors for this pathologic condition.",10.1016/j.soard.2016.09.003,,,,1066
1356,Gastric bypass reduces fat intake and preference.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the most effective therapy for morbid obesity. This study investigated how gastric bypass affects intake of and preference for high-fat food in an experimental (rat) study and within a trial setting (human). Proportion of dietary fat in gastric bypass patients was significantly lower 6 yr after surgery compared with patients after vertical-banded gastroplasty (P = 0.046). Gastric bypass reduced total fat and caloric intake (P < 0.001) and increased standard low-fat chow consumption compared with sham controls (P < 0.001) in rats. Compared with sham-operated rats, gastric bypass rats displayed much lower preferences for Intralipid concentrations > 0.5% in an ascending concentration series (0.005%, 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 5%) of two-bottle preference tests (P = 0.005). This effect was demonstrated 10 and 200 days after surgery. However, there was no difference in appetitive or consummatory behavior in the brief access test between the two groups (P = 0.71) using similar Intralipid concentrations (0.005% through 5%). Levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) were increased after gastric bypass as expected. An oral gavage of 1 ml corn oil after saccharin ingestion in gastric bypass rats induced a conditioned taste aversion. These findings suggest that changes in fat preference may contribute to long-term maintained weight loss after gastric bypass. Postingestive effects of high-fat nutrients resulting in conditioned taste aversion may partially explain this observation; the role of GLP-1 in mediating postprandial responses after gastric bypass requires further investigation.",10.1152/ajpregu.00139.2011,,,,1067
907,"Changes in glycemia, insulin and gut hormone responses to a slowly ingested solid low-carbohydrate mixed meal after laparoscopic gastric bypass or band surgery.","To evaluate early changes in glycemia, insulin physiology and gut hormone responses to an easily tolerated and slowly ingested solid, low-carbohydrate mixed meal test (MMT) following laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. This was a prospective non-randomized study. Plasma glucose, insulin and c-peptide (to estimate hepatic insulin extraction; %HIE), incretins (GIP, aGLP-1) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) responses to the MMT were measured at 4-8 weeks before and after surgery in obese, metabolically healthy patients (RYGB=10F or LAGB =7F/1M). Supplementary clamp data on basal endogenous glucose production (EGP) and peripheral insulin action (Rd=rate of glucose disposal) and metabolic clearance rates of insulin (MCR-INS) were available in five of the RYGB patients. Repeated measures were appropriately accounted for in the analyses. Following LAGB surgery, C-peptide and insulin MMT profiles (P=0.004 and P=0.0005, respectively) were lower with no change in %HIE (P=0.98). In contrast, in RYGB subjects, both fasting glucose and insulin (Î”=-0.66â€‰mmolâ€‰l-1, Pâ©½0.05 and Î”=-44.4â€‰pmolâ€‰l-1, Pâ©½0.05, respectively) decreased, and MMT glucose (P<0.0001) and insulin (P=0.001) but not c-peptide (P= 0.69) decreased. Estimated %HIE increased at fasting (Î”=8.4%, Pâ©½0.05) and during MMT (P=0.0005). Early (0-20â€‰min) prandial glucose (0.27Â±0.26 versus 0.006Â±0.21â€‰mmolâ€‰l-1, Pâ©½0.05) and insulin (63(48, 66) versus 18(12, 24) pmolâ€‰l-1, Pâ©½0.05) responses increased after RYGB. RYGB altered the trajectory of prandial aGLP-1 responses (treatment Ã— trajectory P=0.02), and PP was lower (P<0.0001). Clamp data in a subset of RYGB patients showed early improvement in basal EGP (P=0.001), and MCR-INS (P=0.015). RYGB results in distinctly different changes in plasma glucose, insulin and gut hormone response patterns to a solid, slowly ingested low-carbohydrate MMT versus LAGB. Altered nutrient delivery, along with indirect evidence for changes in hepatic and peripheral insulin physiology, are consistent with the greater early improvement in glycemia observed after RYGB versus LAGB surgery.",10.1038/ijo.2017.22,,,,1068
1513,Boussignac CPAP in the postoperative period in morbidly obese patients.,"In the postoperative period hypoventilation and hypoxia with hypercarbia may occur in morbidly obese patients due to the residual influence of general anesthesia drugs, postoperative atelectasis and postoperative pain. Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) is a method of improvement of respiratory efficiency in patients not requiring mechanical ventilation. The aim of the study was to compare NIV (Boussignac) CPAP and traditional oxygen delivery via nasal catheter in the postoperative acute care unit (PACU) in morbidly obese patients after open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP). 19 morbidly obese patients scheduled for elective open RYGBP, were randomly divided into 2 groups: CPAP (10 patients) or control (nasal catheter - 9 patients). Patients consisted of: 8 male and 11 female, mean weight 127.76 +/- 18.5 kg, height 173.41 +/- 9.41 cm, BMI 42.43 +/- 3.3 kg/m2, age 35.84 +/- 9.05 years. In the PACU, capillary blood gas measurements were taken at 3 Time Points: T1 - 30 min, T2 - 4 hours and T3 - 8 hours after admission. Sample T0 was taken before surgery. For management of postoperative pain, patients received morphine 2 mg/h intravenously and tramadol 100 mg. Mean blood gas measurements of all postoperative time points were: pO2 81.0+/-16.0 (range 78.1-85.7) mmHg vs 65.9+/-4.9 (range 63.8-68.1) mmHg (P<0.05); pCO2 40.6+/-2.4 (range 39.4-41.8) mmHg vs 41.5+/-4.0 (range 39.6-43.4) mmHg (P>0.05), in the CPAP and control groups respectively. In every case, pulse-oxymetry oxygenation was >94%. Boussignac CPAP improved blood oxygenation compared to passive oxygenation with a nasal catheter but had no influence on CO2 elimination in non-CO2 retaining morbidly obese patients.",10.1007/s11695-007-9079-1,,,,1069
1037,Antecolic or Retrocolic Alimentary Limb in Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass? A Meta-Analysis.,"Internal hernia (IH) is a severe complication after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The orientation of the alimentary limb has advocated to affect IH. Available data regarding the incidence of IH, gastro-jejunostomy leakage, obstructive symptoms, anastomotic obstruction, adhesion, incisional hernia, total complications, and recurrent IH were meta-analyzed according to the orientation of the alimentary limb. Fourteen studies (13,660 patients) were included. Antecolic orientation resulted associated with a lower incidence of IH and obstructive symptoms, while the route of the alimentary limb did not show to affect the other outcomes. Antecolic orientation decreases the IH. However, the role and the technique of the closure of mesenteric defects cannot be stated due to the lack of adequate data to date. Well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed.",10.1007/s11695-015-1918-x,,,,1070
1649,"Prospective, randomized evaluation of midline fascial closure in gastric bariatric operations.","Severe obesity is cited as a major risk factor for fascial wound dehisence and late incisional hernia after major abdominal surgery. The purpose of this study was to prospectively compare two methods of closure of the linea alba after gastric restrictive operations performed for treatment of morbid obesity. During a 6-year period 229 patients were randomized to have closure of the midline fascia using either a double-stranded #1 PDS suture placed in a continuous fashion or #1 Ethibond suture placed using an interrupted figure-eight technique. Two of 109 patients who had closure with Ethibond suffered an acute dehiscence of the midline fascia vs no cases of fascial dehiscence in the PDS group. There were no wound infections in either group. There were 20 late incisional hernias (18%) in the Ethibond group vs 11 late hernias (10%) in the PDS group (P < or = 0.04). Mean postoperative follow-up time for all patients was 29.4 months. The cost of suture material and the time required to completely close the linea alba were also calculated for each group. The mean closure time in the Ethibond group was 13.3 vs 9.1 minutes in the PDS group (P < 0.0001). Although the cost per suture pack of #1 PDS was $4.63 vs $1.76 per pack for #1 Ethibond, the mean cost of sutures per patient was $4.81 for PDS vs $11.09 for Ethibond. We conclude that #1 PDS placed in a continuous fashion provides a more secure and cost-effective closure of the midline fascia in morbidly obese patients than #1 Ethibond placed using an interrupted figure-eight technique.",10.1016/S0002-9610(96)00194-8,,,,1071
328,Long-term Effect of Bariatric Surgery on the Use of Levothyroxine and Thyroid Levels.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of bariatric surgery on the defined daily dose of levothyroxine (DDD LT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and free thyroxine (fT4) in female patients with hypothyroidism until 48Â months after surgery. A retrospective observational study of hypothyroid patients who underwent bariatric surgery. Changes in DDD LT4, TSH, and fT4 over a 48Â month period after surgery were analyzed. Thirty-seven patients were included: 27 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), 6 sleeve gastrectomy (SG), 3 adjustable gastric band, and 1 one anastomosis gastric bypass. The median DDD LT4 decreased from 125Â Âµg at baseline to 100Â Âµg 12Â months after surgery. From 24 to 48Â months after surgery, the median DDD LT4 was stable at 125Â Âµg. Most dose adjustments occurred during the first 24Â months after surgery. In the time period of 24-48Â months after surgery, the dose remained stable in 73.1% of the RYGB patients and in 60.0% of the SG patients. After 48Â months in the RYGB group, no significant change in TSH and fT4 levels was observed. Bariatric surgery led to frequent dose adjustments during the first 2Â years after surgery. However, 24-48Â months after surgery in the majority of patients, the dosage remained stable. No significant change in TSH and fT4 was observed 48Â months after RYGB. In the first 2Â years after surgery, clinicians should frequently monitor TSH and fT4 for individual dose adjustment of levothyroxine. Thereafter, the frequency of monitoring may be decreased.",10.1007/s11695-021-05810-2,,,,1072
105,"Dasiglucagon Treatment for Postprandial Hypoglycemia After Gastric Bypass: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.","Postbariatric hypoglycemia affects >50% of individuals who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. Despite the often debilitating nature of this complication, existing treatment options are limited and often inefficient. Dasiglucagon is a stable glucagon analog available in a ready-to-use formulation and was recently shown to mitigate postbariatric hypoglycemia in experimental settings. Here, we aimed to evaluate the hypoglycemic hindering potential of dasiglucagon in an outpatient trial. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, proof-of-concept study at the Center for Clinical Metabolic Research at Gentofte Hospital in Denmark. The study included 24 individuals who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (n = 23 women) with continuous glucose monitor-verified postbariatric hypoglycemia (â‰¥15 min at <3.9 mmol/L three or more times per week) randomly assigned to two treatment periods of 4 weeks of self-administered subcutaneous dasiglucagon at 120 Î¼g or placebo. The primary and key secondary outcomes were continuous glucose monitor-captured percentage of time in level 1 and 2 hypoglycemia (<3.9 and <3.0 mmol/L), respectively. Compared with placebo, treatment with dasiglucagon significantly reduced time in level 1 hypoglycemia by 33% (-1.2 percentage points; 95% CI -2.0 to -0.5; P = 0.002) and time in level 2 hypoglycemia by 54% (-0.4 percentage points; 95% CI -0.6 to -0.2; P < 0.0001). Furthermore, dasiglucagon corrected hypoglycemia within 15 min in 401 of 412 self-administrations, compared with 104 of 357 placebo self-administrations (97.3% vs. 29.1% correction of hypoglycemia rate; P < 0.001). Dasiglucagon was generally well tolerated, with mostly mild to moderate adverse events of nausea. Compared with placebo, 4 weeks of self-administered dasiglucagon effectively reduced clinically relevant hypoglycemia in individuals who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.",10.2337/dc23-1193,,,,1073
633,Frequency of Hypoglycaemia after Different Bariatric Surgical Procedures.,"The frequency of postprandial hypoglycaemia after different operative procedures of bariatric surgery (BS) is unknown, although this complication is potentially dangerous. Predictors and severity of hypoglycaemia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy, and gastric banding were investigated in a large prospective study. This study was performed at an excellence centre for BS at a tertiary care institution. Data of 333 patients (mean BMI: 44.9 Â± 9.6 kg/m2; mean age: 40 Â± 10 years; 80.7% women) were analysed in a prospective study with a 2-year observation period after BS. All patients underwent a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with measurements of blood glucose (BG) and insulin. For the purpose of this study, hypoglycaemia was defined as a post-challenge BG <2.8 mmol/L during the OGTT. 72 (25.6%) of 281 patients showed post-challenge hypoglycaemia after surgery. Hypoglycaemia was different after various procedures: 32.6% of patients after RYGB, 22.6% after sleeve gastrectomy, but only 2.3% after gastric banding had hypoglycaemia. In the whole group, patients with hypoglycaemia had lost more weight (p = 0.013), had a slightly greater decrease in BMI (p = 0.037), a greater change in 2-hour post-challenge BG (p = 0.001), and a smaller change in 1-hour post-challenge insulin (p = 0.004) compared to patients without hypoglycaemia. This prospective study shows a higher prevalence of severe hypoglycaemia (25.6%) after BS than anticipated from retrospective registers. A systematic evaluation of glucose and insulin levels by OGTT 2 years post-surgery may help to identify patients at increased risk for symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycaemia.",10.1159/000493735,,,,1074
1611,A comparison of multimodal perioperative analgesia to epidural pain management after gastric bypass surgery.,"We compared pain intensity, analgesic consumption, patient satisfaction, and length of stay in 114 patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery under general anesthesia. Patients were randomized to incisional local anesthetic infiltration plus postoperative patient-controlled analgesia (Group A), epidural anesthesia and analgesia (Group B), or postoperative patient-controlled analgesia (Group C). All received perioperative nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Age, sex, body mass index, length of stay, and patient satisfaction were equivalent in all groups. Pain at time 0 and 36 h was the smallest in Group B, greater in Group A, and greatest in Group C. Pain scores in a subset of Group A were lower at all times than in Groups B and C, but this difference was significant only at 0, 12, and 36 h. In responders, infiltration analgesia as part of a multimodal regimen offers a simple, safe, and inexpensive alternative to epidural pain control.",10.1097/00000539-200302000-00032,,,,1075
753,FOOD INTAKE EVALUATION DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF POSTOPERATIVE OF PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS OR GLYCEMIC ALTERATION SUBMITTED TO ROUX-EN-Y GASTRIC BYPASS.,": Obesity is one of the main causes of glycemic change. Failure of clinical obesity treatment may lead to an increase in bariatric surgery. Dietary guidance, in conjunction with disabsorptive and hormonal factors resulting from the anatomical and physiological changes provoked by the surgery, is associated with changes in food intake. To analyze food intake evolution during the first postoperative year of Roux-en-y gastric bypass in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or glycemic alteration. : This was a longitudinal and retrospective observational study. For food intake evolution analysis, linear regression models with normal errors were adjusted for each of the nutrients. At 12 months, all patients presented improvement in glycemic levels (p&lt;0.05). During the first postoperative year, there was a reduction in energy intake, macronutrients, consumption of alcoholic beverages and soft drinks. Conversely, there was an increase in fiber intake and diet fractionation. It was observed that, despite gastric restrictions, the micronutrient intake specifically recommended for glycemic control was greater up to six months postoperatively. There was change in the quantity and quality of food intake. It was the most prevalent glycemic control contributor up to six months postoperatively. At the end of one year, the diet underwent a change, showing a similar tendency to the preoperative food intake pattern.",10.1590/0102-672020180001e1367,,,,1076
1401,Impact of aerobic exercise training on heart rate variability and functional capacity in obese women after gastric bypass surgery.,"Obesity is a major public health concern on a global scale. Bariatric surgery is among the treatment options, resulting in significant and sustainable weight loss as well as amelioration of comorbidities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a 12-week aerobic exercise program positively impacts heart rate variability (HRV) and functional capacity after gastric bypass surgery (GBS) in a female cohort. Of the 52 patients initially recruited, 21 were randomized to a training group (TG) or control group and successfully completed the study. Patients were tested on two occasions: 1Â week before GBS and 4Â months after GBS. Anthropometric variables, body composition, record of heart rate and R-R intervals, and 6-min walk test (6MWT) were assessed at both time points. The TG underwent an aerobic exercise training program on a treadmill (1-h session, totaling 36 sessions over 12 weeks). The main findings from this study were: (1) only the TG demonstrated a significant increase (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) in all indexes of heart rate variability (HRV) after 12Â weeks of aerobic exercise training and (2) only the TG demonstrated a significant increase (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) in 6MWT distance and decrease in diastolic blood pressure after aerobic exercise training. We conclude that 12Â weeks of aerobic exercise training improves cardiac autonomic modulation and functional capacity 4Â months after GBS.",10.1007/s11695-010-0319-4,,,,1077
1321,Linear-stapled versus circular-stapled laparoscopic gastrojejunal anastomosis in morbid obesity: meta-analysis.,"The study aims to provide a pooled analysis of individual small trials comparing linear-stapled versus circular-stapled laparoscopic gastrojejunal (GJ) anastomosis in morbid obesity surgery. A systematic literature search of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane library databases was performed. Primary outcomes were GJ leak and stricture. Secondary outcomes were operative time, length of hospital stay, postoperative bleeding, wound infection, marginal ulcers, and estimated weight loss. Pooled odds ratios were calculated for categorical outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes. Nine trials were included comprising 9374 patients (2946 linear vs. 6428 circular). Primary outcome analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in the rate of GJ stricture associated with circular-stapled anastomosis. A significantly reduced rate of wound infection, bleeding, and operative time associated with linear stapling was also found. No significant differences appeared for the other outcomes. This pooled analysis recommends the preferential use of the linear stapling technique over circular stapling.",10.1097/SLE.0b013e3182470f38,,,,1078
1082,"Effects of Prebiotic and Synbiotic Supplementation on Inflammatory Markers and Anthropometric Indices After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: A Randomized, Triple-blind, Placebo-controlled Pilot Study.","Studies have shown that prebiotics and synbiotics modulate the intestinal microbiota and may have beneficial effects on the immune response and anthropometric indices; however, the impact of the use of these supplements after bariatric surgery is not yet known. This study investigated the effects of prebiotic and synbiotic supplementation on inflammatory markers and anthropometric indices in individuals undergoing open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). In this randomized, controlled, and triple-blind trial conducted as a pilot study, individuals undergoing RYGB (n=9) and healthy individuals (n=9) were supplemented with 6 g/d of placebo (maltodextrin), prebiotic (fructo-oligosaccharide, FOS), or synbiotic (FOS+Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria strains) for 15 days. Interleukin-1Î², interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-Î±, C-reactive protein, albumin, and the C-reactive protein/albumin ratio showed no significant changes on comparison between groups after supplementation. The reduction in the body weight of patients undergoing RYGB was 53.8% higher in the prebiotic group compared with the placebo group (-0.7 kg, P=0.001), whereas the reduction in the BMI and the increase in the percentage of excess weight loss were higher in the placebo and the prebiotic groups compared with the synbiotic group (P<0.05). Supplementation of FOS increased weight loss, whereas both prebiotics and synbiotics were not able to promote significant changes in inflammatory markers, although in most analyses, there was a reduction in their absolute values. The use of FOS may represent a potential adjunct in the treatment of obesity.",10.1097/MCG.0000000000000328,,,,1079
536,A Systematic Review and Network-Meta-Analysis ofÂ Gastro-Enteric Reconstruction Techniques Following Pancreatoduodenectomy to Reduce Delayed Gastric Emptying.,"This network meta-analysis aimed to identify the reconstruction technique associated with lowest rates of DGE following pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). A systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase and MEDLINE databases was carried out using the PRISMA framework to identify all RCTs comparing reconstruction techniques of gastrojejunostomy after PD, with overall DGE as the primary endpoint. The primary outcome measure was overall DGE. Secondary outcomes were grade B/C DGE, duration of nasogastric tube, time to solid food intake, overall and grade B/C pancreatic fistula, bile leaks, reoperation, length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality. The search strategy identified eight RCTs including 761 patients. Six RCTs compared antecolic (nâ€‰=â€‰291 patients) and retrocolic Billroth II (nâ€‰=â€‰289 patients) reconstruction (nâ€‰=â€‰6 studies), and two RCTs compared antecolic Billroth II (nâ€‰=â€‰92 patients) and Roux-en-Y (nâ€‰=â€‰89 patients) reconstruction. Overall, antecolic Billroth II ranked best for overall and grade B/C DGE, bile leak, surgical site infection, length of stay and in-hospital mortality. Roux-en-Y was best for overall and grade B/C pancreatic fistula. Antecolic Billroth II gastroenteric reconstruction is associated with the lowest rates of delayed gastric emptying after PD amongst the currently available techniques of gastrojejunostomy reconstructions.",10.1007/s00268-020-05459-5,,,,1080
1555,Health-related quality of life after the surgical treatment of obesity.,"The aim of the study is to answer the question: what is the range and character of changes within health-related quality of life (HRQL) in obese patients who have undergone surgical treatment (VBG - vertical banded gastroplasty or RYGBP - Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) in the period of three and six months after operation? Three groups of patients participated in the study: G I (n=33; BMI 49.90 +/- 6.74 kg/m(2)) - tested prior to the operation, G II (n=17; BMI 34.26 +/- 5.28 kg/m(2)) - tested six months after the operation, and G III (n=11) - examined prior to the operation (BMI 45.72 +/- 5.27 kg/m(2)) as well as three months after the operation (BMI 36.10 +/- 4.60 kg/m(2)). The Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) questionnaire was used as an indicator of HRQL. Surgical treatment of obesity resulted in significant positive changes in relation to the basic dimensions of NHP: energy, pain, physical mobility and in the influence of the current health state on selected spheres of life: paid employment, jobs around the house, social life, sex life, interests and hobbies, holidays. Significant changes in HRQL resulting from bariatric surgery occur in a relatively short period of time and are related not only to physical but also to social functioning.",,,,,1081
1203,Analgesic treatment in laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery: a systematic review of randomized trials.,"This review aimed to present an overview of the randomized controlled trials investigating analgesic regimens used in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) surgery. Literature search was performed in PubMed and EMBASE databases in August 2013 in accordance to PRISMA guidelines. The literature search identified nine studies eligible for inclusion. The administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, local anesthetics (intraperitoneally or subfascially/subcutaneously), transversus abdominis plane block, dexmedetomidine, and ketamine may improve analgesia compared to placebo/controls in LRYGB. None of the studies incorporated multimodal procedure-specific analgesic regimens. The Oxford quality scoring system scores indicated a generally limited methodological quality of the included studies. This review documents a need for high-quality, procedure-specific literature concerning analgesic treatment in LRYGB surgery.",10.1007/s11695-013-1172-z,,,,1082
1397,[Complications after gastric-bypass surgery for morbid obesity].,"The use of conservative methods of treatment of obesity shows that decrease in body weight is accompanied by improvement of general condition, and a significant positive effect in essential types of metabolism, in particular, helps to reduce the frequency of diabetes type II and other components of the metabolic syndrome. However, to achieve sustained weight loss in patients with morbid obesity, using only conservative treatment is almost impossible. In connection with what clinicians have actively solve this issue, including the surgical treatment. Surgical treatment of obesity are shown in patients with third degree obesity (BMI > or = 40), when there is no result from long-term treatment diets and other therapeutic methods. Along with the positive effect that manifests itself in rapid weight loss, normalization of lipids and blood glucose, these interventions, particularly bypass, are characterized by specific complications, which can be fatal to patients. The most common of them, apart from surgical (anastomotic stenosis, infection, etc) are: malabsorption syndrome, and dumping syndrome. Exactly these complications are presented in the description of the case.",,,,,1083
1010,Short-Term UVB Treatment or Intramuscular Cholecalciferol to Prevent Hypovitaminosis D After Gastric Bypass-a Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Gastric bypass is increasingly used worldwide to treat morbidly obese patients with good results. However, several studies have reported low levels of vitamin D in spite of supplementation. In this randomized clinical trial, we have evaluated two principally different interventions, short-term UVB treatment or a single cholecalciferol injection, to prevent hypovitaminosis D. Seventy-three patients, randomly treated by UVB (nâ€‰=â€‰26) or injection (nâ€‰=â€‰20), and compared to controls (nâ€‰=â€‰27), were followed for 6Â months. Both interventions, 12 treatments of whole-body narrowband UVB and an intramuscular injection of 600,000Â IU cholecalciferol, were given in December, when natural sunlight is limited. Blood samples for 25-OH-vitamin D (25[OH]D), intact PTH, calcium, and albumin were obtained at baseline, after 1 and 3Â months, and after 6Â months for the intervention groups. 25[OH]D was analyzed using a HPLC method. At baseline, 77.2Â % of the patients had 25[OH]D <75Â nmol/L. At 3Â months, both UVB and cholecalciferol injection resulted in significantly higher 25[OH]D levels than controls (71.6 and 77.9 vs. 48.6Â nmol/L, pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). The levels remained rather constant at 6Â months (69.0 and 76.7Â nmol/L, respectively); however, only injection therapy resulted in improved levels compared to baseline (55.7Â nmol/L, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). No toxic effects, nor significant changes in PTH or albumin-adjusted calcium, were seen. In this randomized trial, both interventions, UVB and cholecalciferol, given as an adjunct to oral supplementation in gastric bypass patients, increased the levels of 25[OH]D. Simplicity makes injection therapy suitable for maintaining vitamin D levels during the Nordic winter.",10.1007/s11695-016-2081-8,,,,1084
731,"Does rating with a checklist improve the effect of E-learning for cognitive and practical skills in bariatric surgery? A rater-blinded, randomized-controlled trial.","Mental training of laparoscopic procedures with E-learning has been shown to translate to the operating room. The present study aims to explore whether the use of checklists during E-learning improves transfer of skills to the simulated OR on a Virtual Reality (VR) trainer for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Laparoscopy naive medical students (nâ€‰=â€‰80) were randomized in two groups. After an E-learning introduction to RYGB, checklist group rated RYGB videos using the validated Bariatric Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (BOSATS) checklist while group without checklist only observed the videos. Participants then performed RYGB on a VR-trainer twice and were evaluated by a blinded expert rater using BOSATS. A multiple choice (MC) knowledge test on RYGB was performed. Suturing on a cadaveric porcine small bowel was evaluated using objective structured assessment of technical skill (OSATS). Checklist group was better in the knowledge test (A 8.3â€‰Â±â€‰1.1 vs. B 7.1â€‰Â±â€‰1.3; pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.001) and there was a trend towards better VR RYGB performance (BOSATS) on the first try (85.9â€‰Â±â€‰10.2 vs. 81.1â€‰Â±â€‰11.5; pâ€‰=â€‰0.058), but not on the second try (92.0â€‰Â±â€‰9.7 vs. 89.3â€‰Â±â€‰10.5; pâ€‰=â€‰0.251). Suturing as measured by OSATS was not different (29.5â€‰Â±â€‰3.0 vs. 29.0â€‰Â±â€‰3.5; pâ€‰=â€‰0.472). This study presents evidence that the use of a BOSATS checklist during E-learning helps trainees to improve their knowledge acquisition with E-learning. The transfer from mental training to the simulated OR environment seems to be partially enhanced by use of the BOSATS checklist. However, more research is required to investigate potential benefits.",10.1007/s00464-018-6441-4,,,,1085
389,The Positive Impact of Resistance Training on Muscle Mass and Serum Leptin Levels in Patients 2-7 Years Post-Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: A Controlled Clinical Trial.,"Resistance training program (RTP) assist the maintenance of optimal body composition and inflammatory response modulation in individuals in late Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). This study aimed to investigate the effect of RTP on body composition and serum inflammatory profile in individuals 2-7 years post-RYGB. Volunteers were matched on body mass index (BMI), age, sex, and years after surgery, and they were allocated as control or RTP group. Body composition, visceral fat area (VFA), and inflammatory serum markers were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks of RTP. The sample baseline characteristics (n = 63; BMI = 29.7 Â± 5.3 kg/m2) were similar between the groups. After intervention, the RTP group presented higher fat-free mass (Î” 1.17 Â± 1.12 kg, p = 0.003) and skeletal muscle mass (Î” 0.77 Â± 0.66 kg, p = 0.002) and decreased leptin levels (Î” -0.15 Â± 0.60 pg/mL, p = 0.028). Ultrasensitive C-reactive protein (CRPus), interleukin-6, adiponectin, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 showed no significant time-by-group interaction. After the categorization of RTP group individuals by VFA median values (129.8 cm2, IQR 90.9; 152.5), participants with VFA values above the median presented a significant decrease in CRPus (Î” -0.20 mg/L, IQR -7.59; -0.03, p = 0.022) when compared to the participants with VFA values below the median. The RTP improved individuals' body composition by a modest but significant enhancing muscle mass and decreasing serum leptin and CRPus levels, especially in individuals with VFA values above the median. RTPs assist in maintaining the adequate body composition as they contribute to a decrease in proinflammatory markers in long-term RYGB.",10.1007/s11695-021-05494-8,,,,1086
228,Gastrojejunostomy versus endoscopic stenting for the palliation of malignant gastric outlet obstruction: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Though gastrojejunostomy (GJ) has been a standard palliative procedure for gastric outlet obstruction (GOO), endoscopic stenting (ES) has shown to provide benefits due to its non-invasive approach. The aim of this review is to perform a comprehensive evaluation of ES versus GJ for the palliation of malignant GOO. MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL databases were searched and comparative studies of adult GOO patients undergoing ES or GJ were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcomes were survival time and mortality. Secondary outcomes included technical success, clinical success, reinterventions, days until oral food tolerance, postoperative adjuvant palliative chemotherapy, postoperative morbidities, length of stay (LOS), and costs. Pairwise meta-analyses using inverse-variance random effects were performed. After identifying 2222 citations, 39 full-text articles fit the inclusion criteria. In total, 3128 ES patients (41.4% female, age: 68.0Â years) and 2116 GJ patients (40.4% female, age: 66.8Â years) were included. ES patients experienced a shorter survival time (mean difference -24.77Â days, 95% Cl -Â 45.11 to â€‰-Â 4.43, pâ€‰=â€‰0.02) and were less likely to undergo adjuvant palliative chemotherapy (risk ratio 0.81, 95% Cl 0.70 to 0.93, pâ€‰=â€‰0.004). The ES group had a shorter LOS, shorter time to oral intake of liquids and solids, and less surgical site infections (risk ratio 0.30, 95% Cl 0.12 to 0.75, pâ€‰=â€‰0.01). The patients in the ES group were at greater risk of requiring reintervention (risk ratio 2.60, 95% Cl 1.87 to 3.63, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). ES results in less postoperative morbidity and shorter LOS when compared to GJ, however, this may be at the cost of decreased initiation of adjuvant palliative chemotherapy and overall survival, as well as increased risk of reintervention. Both techniques are likely appropriate in select clinical scenarios.",10.1007/s00464-022-09572-5,,,,1087
920,Zinc Deficiency after Gastric Bypass for Morbid Obesity: a Systematic Review.,"Up to 50% of patients have zinc deficiency before bariatric surgery. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the commonest bariatric procedure worldwide. It can further exacerbate zinc deficiency by reducing intake as well as absorption. The British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society, therefore, recommends that zinc level should be monitored routinely following gastric bypass. However, the American guidance does not recommend such monitoring for all RYGB patients and reserves it for patients with 'specific findings'. This review concludes that clinically relevant Zn deficiency is rare after RYGB. Routine monitoring of zinc levels is hence unnecessary for asymptomatic patients after RYGB and should be reserved for patients with skin lesions, hair loss, pica, dysgeusia, hypogonadism or erectile dysfunction in male patients, and unexplained iron deficiency anaemia.",10.1007/s11695-016-2474-8,,,,1088
1510,Microbial flora of the stomach after gastric bypass for morbid obesity.,"The normal stomach is virtually sterile but the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) on bacterial flora in the used (very small proximal pouch) and unused (large bypassed) gastric chambers is not known. In a prospective study, this variable was documented. Bariatric subjects (n=37) were submitted to endoscopic examination of both gastric reservoirs via FUJINON enteroscope model EN-450P5, 7.3 +/- 1.4 years after RYGBP. Age was 42.4 +/- 9.9 years (70.2% females), preoperative BMI was 53.5 +/- 10.6, and current BMI was 32.6 +/- 7.8 kg/m2. Methods included quantitative culture of gastric secretion along with gastric pH and lactulose/hydrogen breath test. None of the subjects displayed diarrhea, malabsorption or other complaints suggestive of GI bacterial overgrowth. Elevated counts of bacteria and fungi were identified in both chambers, with predominance of aerobes and anaerobes, but not molds and yeasts, in the proximal stomach. Gram-positive cocci, bacilli and coccobacilli represented the majority of the isolates. Gastric pH was neutral (pH 7.0 +/- 0.2) in the proximal pouch, whereas the distal chamber mostly but not always conserved the expected acidity (pH 3.3 +/- 2.2, P<0.001). The breath test for bacterial overgrowth was positive in 40.5% of the population. 1) Frequent colonization of both gastric chambers was detected; 2) Aerobes, anaerobes and fungi were represented in both situations; 3) Gastric pH as well as bacterial count was higher in the functioning proximal stomach; 4) Breath test was positive in 40.5% of the subjects; 5) Clinical manifestation such as diarrhea, malabsorption or pneumonia were not demonstrated; 6) Further histologic and microbiologic studies of both the stomach and the small bowel are recommended.",10.1007/s11695-007-9139-6,,,,1089
1111,Changes in liver volume and body composition during 4 weeks of low calorie diet before laparoscopic gastric bypass.,"Weight loss before laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is desirable, because it can reduce liver volume and thereby facilitate the procedure. The optimal duration of a low-calorie diet (LCD) has not been established. The objective of this study was to assess changes in liver volume and body composition during 4 weeks of LCD. Ten women (aged 43Â±8.9 years, 114Â±12.1 kg, and body mass index 42Â±2.6 kg/m(2)) were examined on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28 after commencing the LCD. At each evaluation, body composition was assessed through bioelectric impedance analysis, and liver volume and intrahepatic fat content were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Serum and urine samples were obtained. Questionnaires regarding quality of life and LCD-related symptoms were administered. In total, mean weight decreased by 7.4Â±1.2 kg (range 5.7-9.1 kg), and 71% of the weight loss consisted of fat mass according to bioelectric impedance analysis. From day 0 to day 3, the weight loss (2.0 kg) consisted mainly of water. Liver volume decreased by 18%Â±6.2%, from 2.1 to 1.7 liters (P<.01), during the first 2 weeks with no further change thereafter. A continuous 51%Â±16% decrease was seen in intrahepatic fat content. Systolic blood pressure, insulin, and lipids improved, while liver enzymes, glucose levels, and quality of life were unaffected. A significant decrease in liver volume (18%) occurred during the first 2 weeks of LCD treatment, and intrahepatic fat gradually decreased throughout the study period. A preoperative 2-week LCD treatment seems sufficient in similar patients.",10.1016/j.soard.2014.07.018,,,,1090
812,Platelet Counts and Liver Enzymes After Gastric Bypass Surgery.,"Obesity is associated with chronic inflammation, liver steatosis and increased liver enzymes such as gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), markers for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and liver fat content. Increased platelet counts (PCs) are a biomarker reflecting inflammation and the degree of fibrosis in NAFLD. We investigated alterations in PCs, GGT, ALT, C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP). One hundred twenty-four morbidly obese non-diabetic patients were evaluated before (baseline) and 12Â months after (follow-up) RYGBP. Body mass index (BMI) was reduced from 43.5Â kg/m2 (baseline) to 31.1Â kg/m2 (follow-up), and pâ€‰<â€‰0.001 and weight declined from 126.2 to 89.0Â kg. PCs decreased from 303â€‰Ã—â€‰109 to 260â€‰Ã—â€‰109/l, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001. GGT was reduced from 0.63 to 0.38Â Î¼kat/l, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001. ALT decreased from 0.69 to 0.59Â Î¼kat/l, pâ€‰=â€‰0.006. CRP was lowered from 7.3 to 5.4Â mg/l pâ€‰<â€‰0.001 and ferritin from 106 to 84Â Î¼g/l pâ€‰<â€‰0.001. The alterations in PCs correlated with the changes in CRP (râ€‰=â€‰0.38, pâ€‰=â€‰0.001), BMI (râ€‰=â€‰0.25, pâ€‰=â€‰0.012), weight (râ€‰=â€‰0.24, pâ€‰=â€‰0.015) and inversely correlated with ferritin (râ€‰=â€‰21, pâ€‰=â€‰0.036). PCs, GGT and ALT (markers for NAFLD), and CRP and ferritin (markers for inflammation) decreased in morbidly obese after RYGBP. The decrease in PCs correlated with alterations in CRP, BMI, weight and ferritin. The lowering of liver enzymes may reflect a lowered liver fat content and decreased general inflammation.",10.1007/s11695-017-3035-5,,,,1091
1539,Efficacy of ketorolac in lieu of narcotics in the operative management of laparoscopic surgery for morbid obesity.,"Prompt recovery of protective airway reflexes, freedom from pain, ability to cooperate with respiratory physical therapy, early ambulation and discharge from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), coupled with a stable intraoperative environment have been desired goals of anesthesia management of morbidly obese patients. We used ketorolac in lieu of narcotics toward this goal and present our subjective and objective data in this study. A total of 50 morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery were randomly assigned to 2 groups of 25 each. Group I received intravenous ketorolac perioperatively, which was continued 24 hours postoperatively. Group II received remifentanyl intraoperatively as a part of balanced anesthesia. Intraoperative hemodynamic stability was assessed based on blood pressure, pulse rate, and bispectral index score values. Postoperative pain intensity using a visual analogue scale, as well as the presence of nausea, vomiting, hypotension, or respiratory depression, were also recorded. Postoperative side effects, including pain, nausea, and vomiting; requirements for analgesics and antiemetic medications in the PACU; and the time spent in the PACU varied significantly between the 2 groups. Continued administration of ketorolac during the first 24 hours postoperatively led to improved patient satisfaction and more enthusiastic participation in respiratory physical therapy. Perioperative use of intravenous ketorolac up to 24 hours after laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery for morbid obesity helps provide a more stable intraoperative environment, earlier discharge from the PACU, and better outcome in this subset of patients.",10.1016/j.soard.2005.08.013,,,,1092
1533,"Body composition, dietary intake, and energy expenditure after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic vertical banded gastroplasty: a randomized clinical trial.","To assess body composition, eating pattern, and basal metabolic rate in patients undergoing obesity surgery in a randomized trial. There is limited knowledge regarding how different bariatric surgical techniques function in terms of altering body composition, dietary intake, and basic metabolic rate. Non-superobese patients were randomized to laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LGBP, n = 37) or laparoscopic vertical banded gastroplasty (LVBG, n = 46). Anthropometry, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), computed tomography (CT), indirect calorimetry, and reported dietary intake were registered prior to and 1 year after surgery. Follow-up rate was 97.6%. LGBP patients had significantly greater reduction of waist circumference and sagittal diameter compared with LVBG. DEXA demonstrated a larger reduction of body fat in all compartments after LGBP, especially at the trunk (P<0.001). CT demonstrated more reduction of the visceral fat (P=0.016). Patients were able to eat all types of food after LGBP, although about 30% claimed they avoided fats. LGBP patients decreased their proportion of dietary fat significantly more than those operated on with LVBG (P = 0.005), who consumed more sweet foods and avoided whole meat and vegetables. Lean tissue mass (LTM) was proportionally less reduced, especially in men, after LGBP. The decreases in BMR postoperatively reflected the lower body mass in a pattern that did not differ among the groups. LGBP patients demonstrated better outcomes compared with LVBG patients in terms of body composition. Energy expenditure developed as expected postoperatively. A ""steering"" away from fatty foods after LGBP may be an important mechanism of action in gastric bypass.",10.1097/01.sla.0000218085.25902.f8,,,,1093
1371,"Effects of a balanced energy and high protein formula diet (Vegestart completÂ®) vs. low-calorie regular diet in morbid obese patients prior to bariatric surgery (laparoscopic single anastomosis gastric bypass): a prospective, double-blind randomized study.","Bariatric surgery is considered the only therapeutic alternative for morbid obesity and its comorbidities. High risks factors are usually linked with this kind of surgery. In order to reduce it, we consider that losing at least 10% of overweight in Morbid Obese (MO) and a minimum of 20% in Super- Obese patients (SO) before surgery, may reduce the morbidity of the procedure. The aim of our study is to demonstrate the effectiveness and tolerance of a balanced energy formula diet at the preoperative stage, comparing it against a low calorie regular diet. We studied 120 patients divided into two groups of 60 each, group A was treated 20 days prior to bariatric surgery with a balanced energy formula diet, based on 200 Kcal every 6 hours for 12 days and group B was treated with a low calorie regular diet with no carbs or fat. The last eight days prior to surgery both groups took only clear liquids. We studied the evolution of weight loss, the BMI, as well as behavior of co-morbidities as systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, glucose controls and tolerance at the protocol. The study shows that patients undergoing a balanced energy formula diet improved their comorbidities statistically significant in terms of decrease in weight and BMI loss, blood pressure and glucose, compared to the group that was treated before surgery with a low calorie regular diet. Nevertheless both groups improving the weight loss and co-morbidities with better surgical results and facilities. A correct preparation of the Morbid Obese patients prior of surgery can reduce the operative risks improving the results. Our study show that the preoperative treatment with a balanced energy formula diet as were included in our protocol in patients undergoing bariatric surgery improves statistical better their overall conditions, lowers cardiovascular risk and metabolic diseases that the patients with regular diet alone.",,,,,1094

The first group received mechanical thromboprophylaxis only, while the second group received a combination of mechanical and chemical thromboprophylaxis. Methods. This study included 150 morbidly obese patients who underwent primary one-stage laparoscopic bariatric surgery (sleeve gastrectomy and mini-gastric bypass) over a 6-month period. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups: group A (n = 75) was subjected to mechanical thromboprophylaxis in the form of perioperative elastic stockings on both lower limbs and early postoperative ambulation, and group B (n = 75) was subjected to combined mechanical thromboprophylaxis and chemical thromboprophylaxis in the form of 40Â mg subcutaneous enoxaparin 12Â hours before surgery and postoperative enoxaparin (40Â mg subcutaneous every 24Â hours) for 2Â weeks. Bilateral lower limb venous duplex was done for all patients before discharge, on the second and fourth weeks postoperatively, to detect silent DVT. Results. Nine patients out of 150 patients developed silent DVT (6%). All patients among group A were subjected to mechanical thromboprophylaxis only (12%) [P = .247, relative risk: .45, 95% confidence interval; .37-.62]. There was no silent DVT among group B who received combined mechanical and chemical thromboprophylaxis. No bleeding complications were reported in both groups. Conclusion. Combined mechanical and mechanical thromboprophylaxis is effective and safe in the prevention of silent DVT after laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Trial registration: The trial was registered in the Thai Clinical Trials Registry (TCTR20200127002) on January 20, 2020 retrospectively.",10.1177/1553350620965812,,,,1095
885,Systematic review of transgastric ERCP in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients.,"Balloon-assisted endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatoscopy (ERCP) in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) patients is technically challenging due to anatomic and accessory constraints, thus success rates are modest. Transgastric ERCP (TG-ERCP) offers a viable alternative. We aimed to systematically review the literature on TG-ERCP in RYGB patients to better define the technical approaches, success rates, and adverse events of this procedure. A computer-assisted search of the Embase and PubMed databases was performed to identify studies that focused on the techniques and clinical outcomes of TG-ERCP. Two investigators independently identified studies and abstracted relevant data. The literature search yielded 26 eligible studies comprising 509 TG-ERCP cases. Access to the excluded stomach to facilitate ERCP was achieved laparoscopically in 58% of reported cases, via open surgery (6% of reported cases), by antecedent placement of a percutaneous gastrostomy tube (33%), or with endoscopic ultrasound assistance (3%). Successful gastric access was reported in 100% of cases and successful ductal cannulation in 98.5%. Adverse events were reported in 14% of cases; 80% of these were related to gastrostomy creation and the rest were attributable to ERCP. Wound infections (n = 19, 3.7%) were the most common gastrostomy-related adverse event, and post-ERCP pancreatitis (n = 7, 1.4%) was the most common ERCP-related adverse event. No deaths were reported. Based on existing observational studies, TG-ERCP appears to be a safe and highly effective approach in patients with RYGB anatomy. Additional research and clinical experience are needed to more precisely define the risk-benefit ratio and optimal technique of TG-ERCP.",10.1016/j.soard.2017.02.005,,,,1096
563,Thyroid function before and after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: an observational study.,"Population studies have shown a positive association between thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and body mass index. Recent studies have shown a significant increase in the prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) in obesity. Weight reduction after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) seems to significantly decrease TSH levels. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of SCH in obese patients (class II and III) and to observe the behavior of thyroid hormones (TSH, hormone triiodothyronine, thyroxine, free thyroxine) with significant weight loss after RYGB. Hospital Nossa Senhora das GraÃ§as, Curitiba, ParanÃ¡, Brazil. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 215 obese patients who underwent RYGB between 2005 and 2012 with a follow-up of at least 2 years. The study was observational and descriptive. The selected times for clinical and laboratory evaluations were preoperative, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the procedure. Association, correlation, and variance analyses were performed. The prevalence of SCH preoperatively was 9.3%. SCH was corrected in 89.5% of patients 12 months after RYGB. We did not find an association between TSH and BMI (r = .002, P = .971). There was a positive impact of bariatric surgery on all metabolic variables. We showed that serum TSH level had no positive correlation with the presence or absence of metabolic syndrome. Weight loss after bariatric surgery leads to normalization of TSH levels in most patients and none developed overt hypothyroidism. Obese patients with SCH should not be treated with thyroid hormone replacement. Serial monitoring of thyroid function after obesity therapy seems to be a reasonable approach.",10.1016/j.soard.2019.11.011,,,,1097
520,Application of Vitamin E Acetate on Staple Lines and Anastomoses of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: Impact on Postoperative Pain and Acute Phase Reactants.,"Postoperative pain after laparoscopic surgery has 3 components: parietal, visceral, and associated with pneumoperitoneum. Visceral pain accounts for around 30% of the total pain and is less amenable to be controlled by multimodal analgesia. The topical application of vitamin E ointment has demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect in the local inflammatory response against surgical aggression. Vitamin E has been also associated with a reduction in postoperative pain of skin wounds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the topical application of vitamin E acetate on staple lines and anastomoses of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, as part of a multimodal analgesia scheme within an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) program. A prospective randomized clinical trial was performed. Patients were divided into 2 groups: patients receiving a topical application of vitamin E on staple lines and anastomoses (G1) and patients not receiving it (G2). The primary endpoint was postoperative pain, as measured by VAS 24Â h after surgery. Secondary outcomes include morphine rescue needs, acute phase reactants 24Â h after surgery, and hospital stay. One hundred forty patients were included, 70 in each group. Postoperative pain was 10Â mm in G1 and 21.8Â mm in G2 (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Morphine needs within the first 24Â h were 2.9% in G1 and 13.2% in G2 (pâ€‰=â€‰0.026). C-reactive protein levels were significantly lower in G1 (8.7Â mg/dL vs 11.9; pâ€‰=â€‰0.016). Mean hospital stay was 2.1Â days in G1 and 2.9 in G2 (pâ€‰=â€‰0.019). Topical application of vitamin E reduces postoperative pain and acute phase reactants, allowing an earlier discharge.

591,Learning Curves of Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy in Bariatric Surgery: a Systematic Review and Introduction of a Standardization.,"The most commonly performed bariatric procedures are laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Impact of learning curves on operative outcome has been well shown, but the necessary learning curves have not been clearly defined. This study provides a systematic review of the literature and proposes a standardization of phases of learning curves for RYGB and LSG. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, and CENTRAL databases. All studies specifying a number or range of approaches to characterize the learning curve for RYGB and LSG were selected. A total of 28 publications related to learning curves for 27,770 performed bariatric surgeries were included. Parameters used to determine the learning curve were operative time, complications, conversions, length of stay, and blood loss. Learning curve range was 30-500 (RYGB) and 30-200 operations (LSG) according to different definitions and respective phases of learning curves. Learning phases described the number of procedures necessary to achieve predefined skill levels, such as competency, proficiency, and mastery. Definitions of learning curves for bariatric surgery are heterogeneous. Introduction of the three skill phases competency, proficiency, and mastery is proposed to provide a standardized definition using multiple outcome variables to enable better comparison in the future. These levels are reached after 30-70, 70-150, and up to 500 RYGB, and after 30-50, 60-100, and 100-200 LSG. Training curricula, previous laparoscopic experience, and high procedure volume are hallmarks for successful outcomes during the learning curve.",10.1007/s11695-019-04230-7,,,,1099
1523,[Gastrojejunostomy versus endoscopic stent placement as palliative treatment of malignant stenosis of the duodenum: overview of advantages and disadvantages on the basis of a literature study].,"To compare the results of stent placement and gastrojejunostomy in patients with malignant gastric outlet obstruction. Design. Systematic review. PubMed was searched for relevant articles from January 1996 to January 2006 and further articles were obtained from their reference lists. Using results from these publications, average study scores for improvement of oral intake, complications, survival and costs were calculated. Results from randomized and comparative studies were pooled and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for improvement oforal intake and complications were calculated. A total of 44 publications were identified, including 2 randomized trials and 6 comparative studies. Information on study outcomes was not available in all publications. Long-term effectiveness was higher after gastrojejunostomy than after stent placement, with only 1% of patients needing a reintervention after gastrojejunostomy; more patients developed minor complications after gastrojejunostomy (33%) and the post-operative hospital stay was on average 13 days longer. After stent placement obstructive symptoms were relieved in 89% of patients and this effect was observed to occur more quickly after placement (within 0-2 days). More patients (approximately 20%) required a reintervention after stent placement due to stent migration or obstruction. Stent placement appeared to have favourable short-term results and gastrojejunostomy was associated with better long-term results. Well-performed clinical trials with an adequate number of patients were not found, which precluded more solid conclusions.",,,,,1100
1404,"Nutritional effect of oral supplement enriched in beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, glutamine and arginine on resting metabolic rate after laparoscopic gastric bypass.","Weight regain that begins 12-18 months after laparoscopic gastric bypass has been attributed to changes in resting metabolic rate (RMR), which is largely determined by lean body mass (LBM). An oral supplement containing beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, glutamine, and arginine (HMB/Glu/Arg) has helped to restore LBM in cachexia due to cancer and in critically ill trauma patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral HMB/Glu/Arg on LBM and RMR following laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGB). Patients who underwent LGB were randomized to receive 24 g of HMB/Glu/Arg dissolved in water twice daily for 8 weeks or to receive no supplement. Weight loss, LBM, and RMR were assessed preoperatively, 2 and 8 weeks postoperatively. LBM was determined by dual emission x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and RMR was measured by indirect calorimetry. Thirty patients were enrolled: 80% white; 20% African American; 96.7% women; mean age 46.9Â±8.4 years; mean weight 113.4Â±11.6 kg; and mean body mass index (BMI) 43.3Â±4.1 kg/m2. The experimental and control groups included 14 and 16 patients, respectively, and there was no difference in baseline demographics and characteristics between the two groups. At 8 weeks, weight, BMI, LBM, and RMR significantly decreased by 15.7Â±2.5 kg, 6.0Â±1.0 kg/m2, 7.8Â±4.0 kg, and 290.6Â±234.9 kcal/day, respectively (P<0.0001 for each variable). However, when comparing these changes between the two groups, no statistical significance was observed. There is a significant decrease in weight, BMI, LBM, and RMR in all subjects after LGB, and these changes were not affected by the use of HMB/Glu/Arg. Potential preservation of LBM as a result of HMB/Glu/Arg requires further investigation. However, its consumption (78 calories per serving) did not adversely affect weight loss in the experimental group.",10.1007/s00464-010-1371-9,,,,1101
644,Randomized clinical trial of an enhanced recovery after surgery programme versus conventional care in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.,"Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programmes have led to a decreased duration of hospital stay in several surgical fields, but have not been fully tested in patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) for obesity. This study aimed to investigate an ERAS programme versus standard care in these patients. Between January 2013 and July 2014, patients undergoing LRYGB were randomized to ERAS or conventional care. The primary outcome was functional hospital stay, defined as the time between end of surgery and when predefined discharge criteria (pain adequately controlled, fever and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) absent, full liquid diet tolerated, mobilized and feeling fit for discharge) were met. Secondary outcomes were total length of hospital stay, 30-day complication and mortality rates, duration of surgery, time spent on the recovery ward and health-related quality of life. A total 220 patients were randomized to ERAS (110 patients) or conventional (110) care. Patients in the ERAS group had shorter functional hospital stay (17Â·4 versus 20Â·5â€‰h; Pâ€‰<â€‰0Â·001), quicker pain control, tolerated liquid diet earlier, had earlier control of PONV, mobilized sooner and were comfortable with discharge sooner than those receiving conventional care. Total length of hospital stay, duration of surgery, time spent on the recovery ward, health-related quality of life, complication and readmission rates did not differ between the study groups. There were no deaths. Patients under ERAS care recovered faster after LRYGB surgery than those receiving conventional care, with no increase in readmission and postoperative morbidity rates.

518,A randomized controlled trial comparing oral and intravenous iron supplementation after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.,"Iron deficiency (ID) is one of the most common postoperative deficiencies that may develop after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The optimal mode of treatment is uncertain. To compare the efficacy of oral ferrous fumarate (FF), oral ferrous gluconate (FG), and a single intravenous infusion of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in women with ID after RYGB. Multicenter randomized controlled trial including 120 women with a serum ferritin <20Â Î¼g/l during follow-up after RYGB. They were randomized into three groups: 41 patients were treated with FF 200Â mg three times a day (total daily dose: 195Â mg elemental iron), 39 received FG 695Â mg twice a day (total daily dose: 160Â mg elemental iron) for three months, and 39 patients were treated with a single intravenous dose of FCM (1000Â mg elemental iron). Serum ferritin levels were measured at six weeks, and three, six and twelve months after the start of supplementation. At three months, persistence of ID was observed in 29.4% and 42.4% of the patients treated with FF and FG, respectively, but in none of those treated with FCM (pÂ <Â 0.001). Over the next nine months, recurrence of ID was observed in 56.5% of patients treated with FF, in 52.9% treated with FG, and in 27.8% of those treated with FCM. Adverse effects were most common during oral treatment. In women developing ID after RYGB, a single dose of intravenous FCM is more effective and better tolerated than the standard treatment with either FF or FG.

1062,Mucosal glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide cell numbers in the super-obese human foregut after gastric bypass.,"Super-obesity, a body mass index>50 kg/m(2), is difficult to treat. Many studies have focused on the anatomic changes of the intestines; the physiologic background is not clearly identified. It is established that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) augments secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), and insulin, but other aspects of gut hormone cell function in the alimentary limb are unknown. To study the effects of laparoscopic RYGB on enteroendocrine cells. University-affiliated, high-volume bariatric surgery center. Eighteen nondiabetic patients were drawn from the present study (NCT 01514799), randomizing between biliopancreatic (BP) limbs of either 60 cm (BP60) or 200 cm (BP200). Demographic characteristics did not differ at baseline or 12 months. Pouch and jejunal biopsies were obtained intraoperatively and using endoscopy at 12 months. Mucosal height and density of hormone-producing cell populations were assessed and mRNA expression measured with real-time polymerase chain reaction. In perianastomotic jejunum, a 4.9-fold increase in GLP-1 cell density was evident 12 months after RYGB, most pronounced in the BP200-group. The densities of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) cells and PYY immunoreactive cells were doubled after 12 months. GIP mRNA was unaffected, but GLP-1 and PYY mRNA were lower 12 months after RYGB. RYGB had no impact on villi length or density of ghrelin-, cholecystokinin-, neurotensin-, secretin-, or serotonin-producing cells after 12 months. Pouch mucosal height and cell densities of ghrelin-, histamine-, serotonin-, and somatostatin-producing cells remained unaffected by RYGB in both groups. RYGB selectively increased the density of incretin-producing cell populations in the jejunum. This may provide anatomic explanation for the observed increased plasma levels of incretins.",10.1016/j.soard.2015.03.021,,,,1104
1530,"[Prophylaxis of thromboembolic complications in patients, operated on for alimentary-constitutional obesity].","Results of laparoscopic and open bariatric opeartions, made in 2 3 patients for alimentary-constitutional obesity (ACO) were analyzed. Restrictive gastroshunting was applied in 19 patients, biliopancreatic shunting according to N. Scopinaro method--in 4, gastric banding using special gastric rings--in 220. Practically in all the patients the consistent leaning was achieved. The efficacy of nonfractionized heparin and low-molecular heparin (Fraxiparine) application for prophylaxis of thromboembolic complications (THEC) was studied up in operated patients. According to our data obtained, in the group, consisting of 118 patients, in whom heparin was applied for the THEC prophylaxis, the rate of specific complications occurrence was in 7 times higher than in group of 113 patients, in whom Fraxiparine was applied for the THEC prophylaxis. While performing reoperations in patients, to whom Fraxiparine was administered in primary operation conduction for prophylaxis, the lower rate of adhesions in abdominal cavity or its absence was noted, comparing with such in group of patients, to whom Fraxiparine during first operation was not administered. Our experience witnesses that application of Fraxiparine during performance of bariatric operative interventions constitutes obligatory condition of successful management of patients suffering ACO in postoperative period, secures essential lowering of the THEC occurrence risk and reduces the adhesions formation in abdominal cavity.",,,,,1105
239,A smartphone application to improve adherence to vitamin and mineral supplementation after bariatric surgery.,"This trial evaluated a smartphone application's effectiveness in improving adherence to vitamin and mineral supplementation postoperatively. This study was a randomized controlled trial comprising 140 patients undergoing bariatric surgery (gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy). Participants were randomized 1:1 to the 12-week intervention, using the smartphone application PromMera, or to standard care. The primary end point was adherence to vitamin and mineral supplementation. Initiation rate and overall adherence to supplementation were high in both groups. Change in objectively measured adherence rate from before the intervention to 1 year post surgery, measured with pharmacy refill data, did not differ between groups for vitamin B12 (-9.6% [SDÂ =Â 27%] vs. -9.3% [SDÂ =Â 30%]; pÂ =Â 0.48) or calcium/vitamin D (-12.3% [SDÂ =Â 29%] vs. -11.5% [SDÂ =Â 32%]; pÂ =Â 0.44). A modest effect on the secondary end point (subjectively measured adherence, using the Medication Adherence Report Scale-5) was seen immediately after the intervention (intervention group 0.00 [SDÂ =Â 1.3] vs. control group -1.2 [SDÂ =Â 3.5]; pÂ =Â 0.021), but this effect did not persist 1 year post surgery. No differences were detected in the prevalence of biochemical deficiencies. The use of the smartphone application PromMera did not obtain a lasting improvement in adherence to vitamin and mineral supplementation 1 year post bariatric surgery.",10.1002/oby.23536,,,,1106
461,SADI-S 250 vs Roux-en-Y Duodenal Switch (RY-DS): Results of 5-Year Observational Study.,"There are only a small number of studies providing a comparison between SADI-S and Hess-Marceau's BPD/Duodenal Switch (RY-DS) operations. We aimed to compare 5-year results of SADI-S 250 (common limb 250Â cm) with RY-DS. Data of patients who underwent open SADI-S (n 226) and RY-DS (n 528) were retrospectively studied. EWL(%), EBMIL(%), TWL(%), antidiabetic effect, complications, and revision rate were compared between the two groups. After the first 12Â months, EWL% (77.0% vs 73.3%) and TWL% (39.4% vs 38.9%) were statistically significantly better after SADI-S (pÂ <â€‰0.01, and pÂ <â€‰0.05 respectively), but not EBMIL% (pÂ >â€‰0.05). At nadir to 24-36Â months, EWL, TBWL, and EBMIL after SADI-S was comparable to the RY-DS group. Up to the fourth and fifth year, better weight loss (TBWL, EBMIL, EWL) was observed after RY-DS than after SADI-S. Early complication rate was less (2.65%) in the SADI-S group vs 5.1% in the RY-DS. Protein deficiency and small bowel obstruction rates were also lower after SADI-S. 93.4% of patients achieved total remission of their diabetes. 7.5% of patients in the SADI-S group had symptoms of bile reflux, which was a main indication for revisions. SADI-S has many advantages over RY-DS. However, weight loss and antidiabetic effects after the third year were marginally lower after SADI-S compared to RY-DS. SADI-S is less dangerous in terms of malabsorption and looks to be a reasonable alternative to RY-DS as a metabolic operation. RY-DS could be implemented for weight regain and/or bile reflux after SADI-S.",10.1007/s11695-020-05031-z,,,,1107
543,Endoscopic management of leaks and fistulas after bariatric surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Endoscopic techniques have become the first-line therapy in bariatric surgery-related complications such as leaks and fistulas. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of self-expandable stents, clipping, and tissue sealants in closing of post-bariatric surgery leak/fistula. A systematic literature search of the Medline/Scopus databases was performed to identify full-text articles published up to February 2019 on the use of self-expandable stents, clipping, or tissue sealants as primary endoscopic strategies used for leak/fistula closure. Meta-analysis of studies reporting stents was performed with the PRISMA guidelines. Data concerning the efficacy of self-expanding stents in the treatment of leaks/fistulas after bariatric surgery were extracted from 40 studies (493 patients). The overall proportion of successful leak/fistula closure was 92% (95% CI, 90-95%). The overall proportion of stent migration was 23% (95% CI, 19-28%). Seventeen papers (98 patients) reported the use of clipping: the over-the-scope clips (OTSC) system was used in 85 patients with a successful closure rate of 67.1% and a few complications (migration, stenosis, tear). The successful fistula/leak closure using other than OTSC types was achieved in 69.2% of patients. In 10 case series (63 patients), fibrin glue alone was used with a 92.8-100% success rate of fistula closure that usually required repeated sessions at scheduled intervals. The complications of fibrin glue applications were reported in only one study and included pain and fever in 12.5% of patients. Endoscopic techniques are effective for management of post-bariatric leaks and fistulas in properly selected patients.",10.1007/s00464-020-07471-1,,,,1108
1459,Endoscopic treatment of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass-related gastrocutaneous fistulas using a novel biomaterial.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is amongst the commonest surgical intervention for weight loss in obese patients. Gastrocutaneous fistula, which usually occurs along the vertical staple line of the pouch, is amongst its most alarming complications. Medical management comprised of wound drainage, nutritional support, acid suppression, and antibiotics may be ineffective in as many as a third of patients with this complication. We present outcomes after endoscopic application of SurgiSIS, which is a novel biomaterial for the treatment of this complication. A case series of 25 patients. Twenty-five patients who had failed conservative medical management of gastrocutaneous fistula after RYGB underwent endoscopic application of SurgiSIS--an acellular fibrogenic matrix biomaterial to help fistula healing. Fistula closure as assessed by upper gastrointestinal imaging and endoscopic examination. In patients who had failed medical management lasting 4-25 (median, 7) weeks, closure of the fistulous tract was successful after one application in six patients (30%), two applications in 11 patients (55%), and three applications in three patients (15%). There were no procedure-related complications. Endoscopic application of SurgiSIS-an acellular fibrogenic matrix--is safe and effective for the treatment of gastrocutaneous fistula after RYGB.",10.1007/s00464-009-0440-4,,,,1109
261,A Systematic Review of Warfarin Use in Post-Bariatric Surgery Patients: Cases Compiled From a Literature Review.,"The objective of this review was to provide dosing recommendations for percentage change in weekly warfarin dose and rates of thrombotic and bleeding events in patients requiring long-term warfarin therapy after bariatric surgery. A comprehensive literature search of PubMed (through April 5, 2021), Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar (through April 5, 2021) databases was completed using the keywords warfarin OR vitamin k antagonist AND bariatric surgery. Retrospective studies and matched-cohort studies evaluating preoperative and postoperative use of warfarin after bariatric surgery for obesity were considered. Weekly dose defined as sum of daily doses of warfarin for 7 consecutive days was a required outcome to be considered in this review. Patients were excluded from review if post-operative dosage change was not reported. Six studies were included with a total of 160 patients who met the criteria. A decrease in average warfarin dose was seen in all studies, with the largest decrease occurring at 1 month postsurgery followed by an upward trend toward baseline about 90 days postsurgery. While thrombotic events were observed in none of the patients, there was an increased risk of bleeding in patients, particularly in those who underwent roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. The study provides a specific warfarin dosing titration regimen, as well as embolic and bleed risk in post-bariatric surgery population. Clinicians may consider lowering warfarin weekly dose by about 25% immediately postsurgery, with doses approaching closer to baseline about 90 days postsurgery.",10.1177/10600280221105312,,,,1110
1319,Acute and long-term effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on glucose metabolism in subjects with Type 2 diabetes and normal glucose tolerance.,"Our aim was to study the potential mechanisms responsible for the improvement in glucose control in Type 2 diabetes (T2D) within days after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Thirteen obese subjects with T2D and twelve matched subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) were examined during a liquid meal before (Pre), 1 wk, 3 mo, and 1 yr after RYGB. Glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent-insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon concentrations were measured. Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), Î²-cell glucose sensitivity (Î²-GS), and disposition index (D(Î²-GS): Î²-GS Ã— 1/HOMA-IR) were calculated. Within the first week after RYGB, fasting glucose [T2D Pre: 8.8 Â± 2.3, 1 wk: 7.0 Â± 1.2 (P < 0.001)], and insulin concentrations decreased significantly in both groups. At 129 min, glucose concentrations decreased in T2D [Pre: 11.4 Â± 3, 1 wk: 8.2 Â± 2 (P = 0.003)] but not in NGT. HOMA-IR decreased by 50% in both groups. Î²-GS increased in T2D [Pre: 1.03 Â± 0.49, 1 wk: 1.70 Â± 1.2, (P = 0.012)] but did not change in NGT. The increase in DI(Î²-GS) was 3-fold in T2D and 1.5-fold in NGT. After RYGB, glucagon secretion was increased in response to the meal. GIP secretion was unchanged, while GLP-1 secretion increased more than 10-fold in both groups. The changes induced by RYGB were sustained or further enhanced 3 mo and 1 yr after surgery. Improvement in glycemic control in T2D after RYGB occurs within days after surgery and is associated with increased insulin sensitivity and improved Î²-cell function, the latter of which may be explained by dramatic increases in GLP-1 secretion.",10.1152/ajpendo.00073.2012,,,,1111
925,The SURMetaGIT study: Design and rationale for a prospective pan-omics examination of the gastrointestinal response to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.,"Objective To describe the protocol of the SURgically induced Metabolic effects on the Human GastroIntestinal Tract (SURMetaGIT) study, a clinical pan-omics study exploring the gastrointestinal tract as a central organ driving remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The main points considered in the study's design and challenges faced in its application are detailed. Methods This observational, longitudinal, prospective study involved collection of gastrointestinal biopsy specimens, faeces, urine, and blood from 25 obese women with T2DM who were candidates for RYGB (20 patients for omics assessment and 5 for omics validation). These collections were performed preoperatively and 3 and 24 months postoperatively. Gastrointestinal transcriptomics; faecal metagenomics and metabolomics; plasma proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics; and biochemical, nutritional, and metabolic data were assessed to identify their short- and long-term correlations with T2DM remission. Results Data were collected from 20 patients before and 3 months after RYGB. These patients have nearly completed the 2-year follow-up assessments. The five additional patients are currently being selected for omics data validation. Conclusion The multi-integrated pan-omics approach of the SURMetaGIT study enables integrated analysis of data that will contribute to the understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in T2DM remission after RYGB.",10.1177/0300060516667862,,,,1112
197,Association Between Energy and Macronutrient Intakes and Weight Change After Bariatric Surgery: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize the evidence on the associations of energy and macronutrient intakes (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) with weight loss in adults after sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass and to determine whether these dietary characteristics of patients with suboptimal weight loss (SWL) or weight regain differ from those without these experiences. PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched until December 2021. Twenty-three observational studies were included. Studies on the association of postoperative energy and macronutrients and weight loss used diverse approaches. Pooled results showed that patients with SWL consumed more energy than those with acceptable weight loss. Weight regainers consumed more energy and carbohydrates and less protein than non-regainers. Higher energy consumption is related to SWL and weight regain after surgery. Associations betweenÂ macronutrients and weight outcome following bariatric surgery warrant further investigation.",10.1007/s11695-022-06443-9,,,,1113
1494,Bowel habits after bariatric surgery.,"Disordered bowel habits might influence quality of life after bariatric surgery. Different types of bariatric operations-gastric banding (AGB), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), or biliopancreatic diversion (BPD)-might alter bowel habits as a consequence of the surgical procedure used. Whether change in bowel habits affects quality of life after AGB, RYGB, or BPD differently is unknown. The study group contained 290 severely obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery between August 1996 and September 2004 [BPD: n = 103, 64.1% women, age 43 +/- 1 years (mean +/- SEM), BMI 53.9 +/- 0.9 kg/m(2), weight 153.4 +/- 2.9 kg; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: n = 126, 73.0% women, age 43 +/- 1 years, BMI 44.2 +/- 0.3 kg/m(2), weight 123.8 +/- 1.5 kg; adjustable gastric banding (AGB): n = 61, 57.4% women, age 44 +/- 1 years, BMI 49.9 +/- 0.5 kg/m(2), weight 146.1 +/- 2.0 kg). Changes in bowel habits, flatulence, flatus odor, and effects on social life were estimated at least 4 months after surgery using a self-administered questionnaire. Fecal consistency changed significantly after surgery. Loose stools and diarrhea were more frequent after BPD and RYGB (P < 0.001) but more so after BPD than after either RYGB or AGB (P < 0.002). Constipation was more likely after AGB (P = 0.03). In addition, malodorous flatus affecting social life was more frequent after BPD than after either RYGB or AGB (P < 0.003). Furthermore, flatus frequency increased after BPD and RYGB, and patients were more bothered by their malodorous flatus than after AGB (all P < 0.001). Flatus severity score was highest in BPD, intermediate in RYGB, and lowest in AGB patients (all P < 0.001), a difference that was not influenced by frequency of metabolic syndrome before and after surgery. Moreover, observation period after surgery had no influence on overall results of bowel habits. Subsore quality of life bariatric analysis and reporting outcome system (BAROS) scores were largely similar between all three groups. However, flatulence severity score correlated inversely with quality of life estimated by BAROS in BPD and RYGB, but not in AGB patients. The type of bariatric surgery affects bowel habits in an operation-specific manner, resulting mainly in diarrhea after BPD and RYGB, and constipation after AGB. Flatulence severity impairs quality of life most in BPD, is intermediate in RYGB, and is only minor after AGB, a phenomenon that was only partially mirrored in quality-of-life measures of BAROS.",10.1007/s11695-008-9456-4,,,,1114
880,"The Effect of a Subcutaneous Infusion of GLP-1, OXM, and PYY on Energy Intake and Expenditure in Obese Volunteers.","Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery is currently the most effective treatment of obesity, although limited by availability and operative risk. The gut hormones Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), Peptide YY (PYY), and Oxyntomodulin (OXM) are elevated postprandially after RYGB, which has been postulated to contribute to its metabolic benefits. We hypothesized that infusion of the three gut hormones to achieve levels similar to those encountered postprandially in RYGB patients might be effective in suppressing appetite. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a continuous infusion of GLP-1, OXM, and PYY (GOP) on energy intake and expenditure in obese volunteers. Obese volunteers were randomized to receive an infusion of GOP or placebo in a single-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study for 10.5 hours a day. This was delivered subcutaneously using a pump device, allowing volunteers to remain ambulatory. Ad libitum food intake studies were performed during the infusion, and energy expenditure was measured using a ventilated hood calorimeter. Postprandial levels of GLP-1, OXM, and PYY seen post RYGB were successfully matched using 4 pmol/kg/min, 4 pmol/kg/min, and 0.4 pmol/kg/min, respectively. This dose led to a mean reduction of 32% in food intake. No significant effects on resting energy expenditure were observed. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that an acute continuous subcutaneous infusion of GOP, replicating the postprandial levels observed after RYGB, is shown to be safe and effective in reducing food intake. This data suggests that triple hormone therapy might be a useful tool against obesity.",10.1210/jc.2017-00469,,,,1115
1178,Experience of excess skin after gastric bypass or duodenal switch in patients with super obesity.,"There is a lack of knowledge about the patient's experience of excess skin after bariatric surgery in patients with body mass index, (BMI)>50 kg/m(2). The objective of this study was to evaluate experience of excess skin after laparoscopic biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD/DS) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and explore possible gender differences. Another aim was to analyze possible correlation between the reported experiences of excess skin with changes in weight, BMI, and hip and waist circumference after surgery. One and/or 2 years after gastric bypass or duodenal switch surgery 57 patients responded to a specific questionnaire. The questionnaire included questions about the amount of excess skin and how much discomfort it caused. Furthermore, the patients were measured concerning weight and waist and hip circumference. One year after surgery, a majority of the patients experienced excess skin scored as>2 (""a lot of"" or ""very much""). The patients in the BPD/DS group experienced significantly more excess skin compared to patients in the LRYGB group. Women experienced more excess skin and discomfort on several body parts than men. The correlations between changes in BMI and the reported experience and discomfort of excess skin were low. There was a low to moderate correlation between changes in waist and hip circumference measures and the experience of excess skin on stomach and buttocks. Weight loss after LRYGB and BPD/DS in super-obese patients is associated with substantial discomfort from excess skin. Women reported more discomfort and experienced more excess skin than men. There was a low correlation between experience of excess skin and changes in weight, BMI, and circumference measures.",10.1016/j.soard.2014.01.033,,,,1116
211,"Differential Gene Expression of Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue among Lean, Obese, and after RYGB (Different Timepoints): Systematic Review and Analysis.","The main roles of adipose tissue include triglycerides storage and adipokine secretion, which regulate energy balance and inflammation status. In obesity, adipocyte dysfunction leads to proinflammatory cytokine production and insulin resistance. Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for obesity, the gold-standard technique being Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Since metabolic improvements after RYGB are clear, a better understanding of adipose tissue molecular modifications could be derived from this study. Thus, the aim of this systematic review was to find differentially expressed genes in subcutaneous adipose tissue of lean, obese and post-RYGB (distinct timepoints). To address this objective, publications from 2015-2022 reporting gene expression (candidate genes or transcriptomic approach) of subcutaneous adipose tissue from lean and obese individuals before and after RGYB were searched in PubMed, Elsevier, and Springer Link. Excluded publications were reviews, studies analyzing serum, other types of tissues, or bariatric procedures. A risk-of-bias summary was created for each paper using Robvis, to finally include 17 studies. Differentially expressed genes in post-RYGB vs. obese and lean vs. obese were obtained and the intersection among these groups was used for analysis and gene classification by metabolic pathway. Results showed that the lean state as well as the post-RYGB is similar in terms of increased expression of insulin-sensitizing molecules, inducing lipogenesis over lipolysis and downregulating leukocyte activation, cytokine production and other factors that promote inflammation. Thus, massive weight loss and metabolic improvements after RYGB are accompanied by gene expression modifications reverting the ""adipocyte dysfunction"" phenomenon observed in obesity conditions.",10.3390/nu14224925,,,,1117
562,"Sleeve Gastrectomy and Gastric Bypass Decrease the Carotid Intima-Media Thickness in Obese Men: Association with Weight Loss, Cardiovascular Risk Factors, and Circulating Testosterone.","Obesity surgery has shown to decrease the carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), but studies that compare different surgical techniques are scarce, especially in men. To evaluate the changes in IMT in men after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and its association with circulating testosterone. Academic Hospital. We studied 40 men with severe obesity, of whom 20 were submitted to laparoscopic RYGB and 20 to SG. Twenty control men matched for age and degree of obesity were also included. Both patients and controls were evaluated at baseline and 6Â months after surgery or conventional treatment with diet and exercise, respectively. The mean carotid IMT decreased after surgery irrespective of the surgical technique whereas no changes were observed in the control men submitted to conventional therapy (Wilks' Î»â€‰=â€‰0.745, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001 for the interaction, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001 for RYGB vs. controls, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001 for SG vs. controls, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.999 for RYGB vs. SG).

375,Postoperative outcomes after bariatric surgery in patients on chronic dialysis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Obesity is a barrier to kidney transplantation for patients with kidney failure. Consequently, bariatric surgery is often considered as a bridge to transplantation, even though its risks and benefits are poorly characterised in the dialysis population. Systematic searches of observational studies indexed in Embase, MEDLINE and CENTRAL till April 2020 were performed to identify relevant studies. Risk of bias was assessed by the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and quality of evidence was summarised in accordance with GRADE methodology. Random effects meta-analyses were performed to obtain summary odds ratios for postoperative outcomes. Four cohort studies involving 4196 chronic dialysis and 732,204 non-dialysis patients undergoing bariatric surgery were included. Sleeve gastrectomy (61%), and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (29%) were the most common procedures performed. Absolute rates of adverse events were low, but the odds of postoperative mortality (0.4-0.5% vs. 0.1%; odds ratio [OR] 4.7, 95%CI 2.2-9.9), and myocardial infarction (0.0-0.5% vs. 0.1%, OR 3.4, 95% CI 2.0-5.9) were higher in dialysis compared to non-dialysis patients. Patients on dialysis also had more than 2-fold increased odds of returning to theatre and having a readmission. Rates of kidney transplant wait-listing among dialysis patients was 59%, with 28% of all patients eventually receiving a kidney transplant. Patients receiving chronic dialysis have substantially increased odds of postoperative mortality and myocardial infarction following bariatric surgery compared with patient who do not have kidney failure. It is uncertain whether bariatric surgery improves the likelihood of kidney transplantation, with mid- to long-term outcomes being poorly described.",10.1016/j.orcp.2021.06.010,,,,1119
53,Changes in Serum Urate Levels after Bariatric Surgery in Patients with Obesity: An Observational Study.,"Obesity is a risk factor for hyperuricemia and gout, while weight reduction can reduce urate levels. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of bariatric surgery on longitudinal serum urate levels. We performed a retrospective observational study of 283 patients who had undergone bariatric surgery [237 (83.7%) gastric bypass, 34 (12.0%) sleeve gastrectomy and 12 (4.2%) gastric banding] and were followed up for 2 years. The results shown represent mean (standard deviation). Bariatric surgery was associated with significant reduction in serum urate from baseline level of 0.343 (0.086) mmol/L to 0.296 (0.076) mmol/L (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) at 12 months and 0.286 (0.073) mmol/L (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) at 24 months, including in men and women, and in patients with or without diabetes. Patients with elevated urate levels at baseline, who comprised 27.2% of the total cohort, achieved reduction in levels by 4 months. Bariatric surgery leads to significant reduction in serum urate levels at 12 and 24 months. This could reduce incidence of gout and need for prophylactic medication(s).",10.1007/s11695-024-07191-8,,,,1120
1575,"Emergence and recovery characteristics of desflurane versus sevoflurane in morbidly obese adult surgical patients: a prospective, randomized study.","We compared postoperative recovery after desflurane (n = 25) versus sevoflurane (n = 25) anesthesia in morbidly obese adults (body mass index >/=35) who underwent gastrointestinal bypass surgery via an open laparotomy. After premedication with midazolam and metoclopramide 1 h before surgery, epidural catheter placement, induction of anesthesia with fentanyl and propofol, and tracheal intubation facilitated with succinylcholine, anesthesia was maintained with age-adjusted 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) desflurane or sevoflurane. Fentanyl IV, morphine or local anesthetics epidurally, and vasoactive drugs as needed were used to maintain arterial blood pressure at +/-20% of baseline value and to keep bispectral index of the electroencephalogram values between 40 to 60 U. Although patients were anesthetized with desflurane for a longer time (261 +/- 50 min versus 234 +/- 37 min, mean +/- sd; P < 0.05, desflurane versus sevoflurane, respectively) and for more MAC-hours (4.2 +/- 0.9 h versus 3.7 +/- 0.8 h; P < 0.05), significantly earlier recovery of response to command and tracheal extubation occurred in patients given desflurane than in patients given sevoflurane. The modified Aldrete score was greater in desflurane-anesthetized patients on admission to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) (P = 0.01) but not at discharge (P = 0.47). On admission to PACU, patients given desflurane had higher oxygen saturations (97.0% +/- 2.4%) than patients given sevoflurane (94.8% +/- 4.4%, P = 0.035). Overall, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting and the use of antiemetics did not differ between the two anesthetic groups. We conclude that morbidly obese adult patients who underwent major abdominal surgery in a prospective, randomized study awoke significantly faster after desflurane than after sevoflurane anesthesia and the patients anesthetized with desflurane had higher oxygen saturation on entry to the PACU.",10.1213/01.ANE.0000136472.01079.95,,,,1121
1233,Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity do not improve 2 weeks after bariatric surgery.,"Bariatric surgery has rapid metabolic effects on glucose metabolism before the occurrence of clinically significant weight loss. This suggests an acute effect of the surgery itself, e.g., resulting from bypassing the nutrient flow from the proximal gastrointestinal tract. Rapid effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) on glucose metabolism were defined. Glucose metabolism and total triglyceride hydrolysis in the basal state and during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp using stable isotopes 2 weeks were studied before and after RYGB. Eighteen pre-menopausal women scheduled for RYGB were included. 2 weeks after RYGB median weight loss was 7.8 kg. Basal insulin and glucose levels decreased after surgery. Endogenous glucose production (EGP) was lower after surgery. In addition, insulin levels were lower during the clamp after surgery, suggesting enhanced clearance. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity did not change. Free fatty acid (FFA) levels increased after surgery both in the basal state and during the first step of the clamp. Total triglyceride hydrolysis did not change in the basal state and tended to be higher during hyperinsulinemia. Within 2 weeks, RYGB reduces basal EGP as well as insulin and glucose levels without an acute beneficial effect on hepatic or peripheral insulin sensitivity. The latter may be explained by higher rates of lipolysis and exposure to FFA induced by the hypocaloric state.",10.1002/oby.20220,,,,1122
1398,Evaluation of bone mineral density loss in morbidly obese women after gastric bypass: 3-year follow-up.,"Studies that evaluate the influence of gastric bypass (RYGP) on bone mass are limited to short-term follow-up. We analysed changes in bone mineral density (BMD) three years after surgery and evaluated the main determinants of the development of bone disease. Prospective study of 59 morbidly obese white women aged 46 Â± 8 years. BMD scanning using DEXA and plasma determinations of calcium, parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and insulin-like growth factor-I were made prior, at 12 months and 3 years after surgery. In the first postoperative year BMD decreased at femoral neck (FN) 10.2 % and in the lumbar spine (LS) 3.2 %, in the third year it additionally decreased 2.7 % and 3.1 %, respectively. BMD at both sites remained above the values of women of the same age. In the follow-up, 1.7 % developed osteoporosis at FN and 6.8 % at LS. Patients with bone disease were older, the percentage of women with menopause was greater in this group and had lower initial and final values of lean mass. The percentage of BMD loss at FN remained positively associated with the percentage of lean mass loss [Î² 0.304, p=0.045], and menopause [Î² 0.337, p=0.025]. Major osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture risk was low even in menopausal patients (3.1 % and 0.40 %, respectively). After RYGP menopausal women and those with greater lean mass loss are at higher risk of BMD loss but progression to osteoporosis is uncommon and the risk of fracture is low.",10.1007/s11695-010-0338-1,,,,1123
1132,The correlation of matrix metalloproteinase 9-to-albumin ratio in wound fluid with postsurgical complications after body contouring.,"The authors' earlier retrospective report of surgical complications after abdominal contouring surgery provided evidence that post-bariatric surgery patients are at increased risk of developing wound complications compared with a normal population. This prospective pilot study was designed as a comparative analysis of both surgical and wound healing characteristics between massive weight loss and normal patients who present for abdominal contouring surgery. Excisional wounds were created and polytetrafluoroethylene tubing was inserted during the preoperative period for later harvesting in patients undergoing abdominal contouring following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for weight loss (n = 16) or abdominoplasty (n = 17). Wound fluids were sequentially collected from drains and subjected to matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) analysis. Standard postsurgical complications were documented. Surgical complications were more common in weight loss patients (47 percent) than in control patients (25 percent). MMP analyses showed that MMP-9 levels remained significantly elevated at postoperative day 4 in patients who subsequently experienced complications in either the weight loss group (p = 0.02) or the control group (p = 0.03). Other parameters showed no significant differences between massive weight loss patients and controls. Although many markers were examined, the ratio of MMP-9 to albumin was the only predictor of postsurgical complications in any group. This lends further support to growing evidence that MMP-9 may be a useful biomarker of postsurgical complications. This pilot work showed no causal factors that explain the higher rates of postsurgical complications in the post-bariatric surgery patient population. Risk, II.",10.1097/PRS.0000000000000520,,,,1124
815,Comparison of gaze behaviour of trainee and experienced surgeons during laparoscopic gastric bypass.,"Eye tracking presents a novel tool that could be used to profile skill levels in surgery objectively. The primary aim of this study was to identify differences in gaze behaviour between expert and junior surgeons performing a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) for obesity. This prospective observational study used a lightweight eye-tracking apparatus to determine the difference in gaze behaviours between expert (more than 75 procedures) and junior (75 or fewer procedures) surgeons at defined stages of LRYGB. Primary endpoints were normalized dwell time and fixation frequency. Secondary endpoints were blink rate, maximum pupil size and rate of pupil change. A total of 20 procedures (12 junior, 8 expert) were analysed. Compared with juniors, experts showed a prolonged dwell time on the screen during angle of His dissection (median (range) 91Â·20 (83Â·40-94Â·40) versus 68Â·95 (59Â·80-87Â·60) per cent; Pâ€‰=â€‰0Â·001), formation of the retrogastric tunnel (91Â·50 (85Â·80-95Â·50) versus 73Â·60 (34Â·60-90Â·50) per cent; Pâ€‰=â€‰0Â·001) and gastric pouch formation (86Â·95 (83Â·60-90Â·20) versus 67Â·60 (37Â·10-80Â·00) per cent Pâ€‰<â€‰0Â·001). Juniors had a greater blink frequency throughout all recorded segments (P <â€‰0Â·010) and had a larger maximum pupil size during all recorded operative segments (Pâ€‰<â€‰0Â·010). Rate of pupil change was greater in juniors in all analysed segments (Pâ€‰<â€‰0Â·010). These results suggest that experts display more focused attention on significant stimuli, alongside experiencing a reduced mental workload and having increased concentration. This has the potential for future use in validation of surgical skill in high-stakes assessment.",10.1002/bjs.10672,,,,1125
927,"Relationship among physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and cardiometabolic risk factors during gastric bypass surgery-induced weight loss.","The impact of daily physical activity (PA) on the cardiometabolic risk of bariatric surgery patients is not known. We examined the influence of physical activity and sedentary behavior on modifying cardiometabolic risk after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and East Carolina University bariatric surgery centers. Data from 43 women and 7 men who completed testing at 1-3 months after RYGB surgery and again at 9 months postsurgery were analyzed. Outcomes measured included PA level (min/d), steps/d, sedentary time, and body composition. Insulin sensitivity was determined with an intravenous glucose tolerance test. Weight and blood lipid profiles also were obtained. Patients reduced body mass index by a mean of -8.0Â±3.4 kg/m2 (P<.001), increased moderate-to-vigorous PA by 17.0Â±47.0 min/d (P = .014), and decreased sedentary time (-47.9Â±101.0 min/d, P = .002). However, 24% of patients decreased overall PA (P<.001), and 39% increased sedentary behavior (P<.001). Changes in overall PA (rho = -.33, P = .006) and steps/d (rho = -.31, P = .0106) were related to weight loss. Insulin sensitivity was associated with light PA before (rho = .37, P<.001) and after (rho = .37, P = .015) intervention. Increasing overall PA also was related to higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (rho = .33, P<.01). Decreasing sedentary time was related to decreased fat mass (rho = .35, P = .012) but not to other cardiometabolic risk factors. The majority of patients increased PA (76%) and decreased sedentary time (61%) after RYGB surgery, but the amount of PA and sedentary time varied substantially. Higher PA, even at low intensity levels, was related to beneficial outcomes in body composition, insulin sensitivity, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.",10.1016/j.soard.2016.08.493,,,,1126
1583,Plasma ghrelin in obesity before and after weight loss after laparoscopical adjustable gastric banding.,"Weight reduction after gastric bypass surgery has been attributed to a decrease of the orexigenic peptide ghrelin, which may be regulated by insulin and leptin. This study examined effects of long-term weight loss after laparoscopical adjustable gastric banding on plasma ghrelin and leptin concentrations and their relationship with insulin action. Severely obese patients (15 women, three men, 36 +/- 12 yr) underwent clinical examinations every 3 months and modified oral glucose tolerance tests to assess parameters of insulin sensitivity and secretion every 6 months. After surgery, body mass index fell from 45.3 +/- 5.3 to 37.2 +/- 5.3 and 33.6 +/- 5.5 kg/m(2) at 6 and 12 months, respectively (P < 0.0001). This was associated with lower (P < 0.0001) plasma glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, waist circumference, and blood pressure. Plasma leptin decreased from 27.6 +/- 9.5 to 17.7 +/- 9.8 (P = 0.0005) and 12.7 +/- 5.1 ng/ml (P < 0.0001). Plasma ghrelin was comparable before and at 6 months (234 +/- 53; 232 +/- 53 pmol/liter) but increased at 12 months (261 +/- 72 pmol/liter; P = 0.05 vs. 6 months). At 6 and 12 months, ghrelin levels correlated negatively with fasting plasma insulin levels and hepatic insulin extraction but not with body mass or insulin action. In conclusion, prolonged weight loss results in a rise of fasting ghrelin concentrations that correlates with fasting insulin concentrations but not improvement of insulin sensitivity.",10.1210/jc.2003-031438,,,,1127
373,Reduced antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of propofol at high-dose on morbidly obese patients.,"This study was aimed to investigate differences in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of propofol at two commonly used dosing schedules on morbidly obese patients. Twenty-two morbidly obese patients were randomly divided into two groups, namely, TBW (dosing based on total body weight) and LBW (dosing based on lean body weight) groups. Three biomarkers, i.e. superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) were measured as indicators of the level of oxidation stress reaction. Pro-inflammatory cytokines including Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Interleukin-8 (IL-8) were used to describe the degree of inflammation. Plasma levels of SOD, MDA and NO were increased and reached a peak value 0.5h after anesthesia induction, but the increase was smaller in the LBW group compared with the TBW group. Besides, plasma concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 were also increased and attained a peak level 0.5h after anesthesia induction, but the increase was higher in the TBW group compared with the LBW group. The LBW-based dosing of propofol had more potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects than the TBW-based dosing during anesthesia induction period on morbidly obese patients. This study provided a dosing recommendation of propofol for morbidly obese patients.",,,,,1128
767,Laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy for gastric outlet obstruction in patients with unresectable hepatopancreatobiliary cancers: A personal series and systematic review of the literature.,"The major symptoms of advanced hepatopancreatic-biliary cancer are biliary obstruction, pain and gastric outlet obstruction (GOO). For obstructive jaundice, surgical treatment should de consider in recurrent stent complications. The role of surgery for pain relief is marginal nowadays. On the last, there is no consensus for treatment of malignant GOO. Endoscopic duodenal stents are associated with shorter length of stay and faster relief to oral intake with more recurrent symptoms. Surgical gastrojejunostomy shows better long-term results and lower re-intervention rates, but there are limited data about laparoscopic approach. We performed a systematic review of the literature, according PRISMA guidelines, to search for articles on laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy for malignant GOO treatment. We also report our personal series, from 2009 to 2017. A review of the literature suggests that there is no standardized surgical technique either standardized outcomes to report. Most of the studies are case series, so level of evidence is low. Decision-making must consider medical condition, nutritional status, quality of life and life expectancy. Evaluation of the patient and multidisciplinary expertise are required to select appropriate approach. Given the limited studies and the difficulty to perform prospective controlled trials, no study can answer all the complexities of malignant GOO and more outcome data is needed.",10.3748/wjg.v24.i18.1978,,,,1129
383,EUS-guided gastroenterostomy versus duodenal stent placement and surgical gastrojejunostomy for the palliation of malignant gastric outlet obstruction: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Malignant gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) is associated with significant morbidity and decreased quality of life, thereby necessitating effective and safe palliative treatment. As such, we sought to compare endoscopic ultrasound-guided gastroenterostomy (EUS-GE) versus duodenal stent (DS) placement and surgical gastrojejunostomy (SGJ) for palliation of malignant GOO. Searches of electronic databases were performed to identify studies comparing EUS-GE versus DS and/or SGJ for palliative treatment of GOO. Outcomes included technical and clinical success, severe adverse events (SAEs), rate of stent obstruction (including tumor ingrowth), length of hospital stay (LOS), reintervention, and 30-day all-cause mortality. Differences in dichotomous and continuous outcomes were reported as risk difference and mean difference, respectively. Seven studies (n = 513 patients) were included. When compared to DS placement, EUS-GE was associated with a higher clinical success, fewer SAEs, decreased stent obstruction, lower rate of tumor ingrowth, and decreased need for reintervention. Compared to SGJ, EUS-GE was associated with a lower technical success; however, LOS was significantly decreased. All other outcomes including clinical success, SAEs, reintervention rate, and 30-day mortality were not significantly different between an EUS-guided versus surgical approach.

Despite SGJ possessing a higher technical success compared to EUS-GE, LOS was significantly longer with no difference in clinical success or rate of adverse events.",10.1007/s00423-021-02215-8,,,,1130
151,DO HELICOBACTER PYLORI INFECTION AND ERADICATION THERAPY STATUS INFLUENCE WEIGHT LOSS OUTCOMES AND ENDOSCOPIC FINDINGS AFTER ROUX-EN-Y GASTRIC BYPASS?A HISTORICAL COHORT STUDY.,"Currently, there is conflicting evidence linking Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection with weight loss and endoscopic findings after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). To identify correlations between HP infection and its eradication with weight loss and endoscopic findings after RYGB. This is an observational retrospective cohort study based on a prospectively collected database of individuals who underwent RYGB from 2018-2019 at a tertiary university hospital. HP infection and the HP eradication therapy outcomes were correlated with post-operative weight loss and endoscopic findings. Individuals were classified according to the status of HP infection into four groups: no infection; successful eradication; refractory infection; and new-onset infection. Of 65 individuals, 87% were female and the mean age was 39Â±11.2 years. Body mass index significantly decreased from 36.2Â±3.6 to 26.7Â±3.3 kg/m2 one year after RYGB (P<0.0001). The percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) was 25.9Â±7.2% and the percentage of excess weight loss was 89.4Â±31.7%. HP infection prevalence decreased from 55.4% to 27.7% (p=0.001); 33.8% never had HP infection, 38.5% were successfully treated, 16.9% had refractory infection and 10.8 % had new-onset HP infection. %TWL was 27.3Â±7.5% in individuals who never had HP, 25.4Â±8.1% in the successfully treated, 25.7Â±5.2% in those with refractory infection, and 23.4Â±6.4% in the new-onset HP infection group; there were no significant differences among the four groups (P=0.6). Pre-operative HP infection significantly associated with gastritis (P=0.048). New-onset HP infections significantly associated with a lower frequency of jejunal erosions after surgery (P=0.048). No effects of the HP infection on weight loss were identified in individuals undergoing RYGB. A higher prevalence of gastritis was observed in individuals with HP infection before RYGB. New-onset HP infection after RYGB was a protective factor for jejunal erosions.",10.1590/S0004-2803.202301000-08,,,,1131
1217,A nickel-titanium memory-shape device forÂ gastrojejunostomy: comparison of the compression anastomosis clip and a hand-sewn anastomosis.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a compression anastomosis clip (CAC) for gastrojejunostomy and comparison of a novel technique with a hand-sewn anastomosis. Sixty-six patients underwent gastrojejunostomy with the CAC or hand-sewn anastomosis. The time of bowel function recovery, the duration of nasogastric drainage, the time of initiation of oral feeding, the duration of postoperative hospital stay, the time needed to expel the clip, and the observation of any complications were recorded. Neither group had anastomotic complications such as leakage or obstruction. Anastomosis time was shorter in the CAC group than in the control group (PÂ <Â 0.01). The mean time of clip expulsion was 15.1Â Â±Â 6.04Â d. There was no statistical difference in postoperative results between the two groups. There was a moderate positive correlation between the day of first bowel movement and the day of clip expulsion (rÂ =Â 0.536) and a strong correlation between the duration of nasogastric drainage and the day of clip expulsion (rÂ =Â 0.881). The method of using a CAC appeared to be safe, easy, inexpensive, and less time consuming. It should be taken into consideration that intra-abdominal complications may cause delayed CAC expulsion.",10.1016/j.jss.2013.10.003,,,,1132
845,Comparison of Oral Iron Supplement Formulations for Normalization of Iron Status Following Roux-EN-y Gastric Bypass Surgery: a Randomized Trial.,"The evidence behind recommendations for treatment of iron deficiency (ID) following roux-en-y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) lacks high quality studies. Academic, United States OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to compare the effectiveness of oral iron supplementation using non-heme versus heme iron for treatment of iron deficiency in RYGB patients. In a randomized, single-blind study, women post-RYGB and iron deficient received non-heme iron (FeSO4, 195Â mg/day) or heme iron (heme-iron-polypeptide, HIP, 31.5 to 94.5Â mg/day) for 8Â weeks. Measures of iron status, including blood concentrations of ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and hemoglobin, were assessed. At baseline, the meanÂ Â±Â standard deviation for age, BMI, and years since surgery of the sample was 41.5Â Â±Â 6.8Â years, 34.4Â Â±Â 5.9Â kg/m2, and 6.9Â Â±Â 3.1Â years, respectively; and there were no differences between FeSO4 (NÂ =Â 6) or HIP (NÂ =Â 8) groups. Compliance was greater than 94%. The study was stopped early due to statistical and clinical differences between groups. Values before and after FeSO4 supplementation, expressed as least square means (95% CI) were hemoglobin, 10.8 (9.8, 11.9) to 13.0 (11.9, 14.0) g/dL; sTfR, 2111 (1556, 2864) to 1270 (934, 1737) Î¼g/L; ferritin, 4.9 (3.4, 7.2) to 15.5 (10.6, 22.6) Î¼g/L; and sTfR:ferritin ratio, 542 (273, 1086) to 103 (51, 204); all pÂ <Â 0.0001. With HIP supplementation, no change was observed in any of the iron status biomarkers (all pÂ >Â 0.05). In accordance with recommendations, oral supplementation using FeSO4, but not HIP, was efficacious for treatment of iron deficiency after RYGB.",10.1007/s11695-017-2858-4,,,,1133
1455,Dexamethasone for postoperative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis: effect on glycaemia in obese patients with impaired glucose tolerance.,"Dexamethasone given to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting may produce significant hyperglycaemia in the perioperative period. The effect of dexamethasone on patients with impaired glucose tolerance is unknown. Thirty obese patients with impaired glucose tolerance undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery were studied in a double-blind fashion. Patients were randomly distributed into two groups: the dexamethasone group (n = 15) received dexamethasone 8 mg intravenously after induction of anaesthesia; the control group (n = 15) received isotonic saline. Fingerprick capillary blood glucose concentrations were measured at baseline and every 2 h during the first 12 h after the start of surgery. In both groups, all blood glucose concentrations measured after the beginning of surgery were higher than baseline values. However, the dexamethasone group showed higher glucose concentrations than the control group from the 6th to the 12th hour of the study. In addition, the maximum blood glucose value in the dexamethasone group (10.4 +/- 1.6 mmol l(-1)) was higher than in the controls (8.8 +/- 1.7 mmol l(-1)) (P < 0.05). Dexamethasone, 8 mg, intravenously administered at the beginning of laparoscopic bariatric surgery in patients with impaired glucose tolerance is associated with significantly increased postoperative blood glucose concentrations.",10.1097/EJA.0b013e328319c09b,,,,1134
1170,Longitudinal assessment of physical activity in women undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Patients undergoing bariatric surgery do not seem to increase objectively measured physical activity (PA) after surgery, despite substantial weight loss. The aims of the present study were (i) to objectively characterize 3 months pre-surgery to 9 months postsurgery PA and sedentary behavior changes in women undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) using tri-axial accelerometers and (ii) to examine associations between pre-surgery versus postsurgery PA and sedentary behavior with anthropometric measures taken in home environment. Fifty-six women, with an average pre-surgery body mass index (BMI) of 37.6 (SD 2.6) and of age 39.5 years (SD 5.7), were recruited at five Swedish hospitals. PA was measured for 1 week by the Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometer, and anthropometric measures were taken at home visits 3 months pre-surgery and 9 months postsurgery, thus limiting seasonal effects. Average BMI loss, 9 months postsurgery, was 11.7 (SD 2.7) BMI units. There were no significant pre- to postsurgery differences in PA or sedentary behavior. However, pre-surgery PA showed negative association with PA change and positive association with postsurgery PA. Adjustments for pre-surgery BMI had no impact on these associations. No significant differences were observed in objectively measured changes in PA or time spent sedentary from 3 months pre-surgery to 9 months postsurgery among women undergoing RYGB. However, women with higher pre-surgery PA decreased their PA postsurgery while women with lower pre-surgery PA increased their PA.",10.1007/s11695-014-1331-x,,,,1135
464,The use of an activity tracker to objectively measure inpatient activity after bariatric surgery.,"Early postoperative ambulation reduces length of stay and prevents postoperative complications after bariatric surgery. Rarely is postoperative inpatient activity objectively measured despite readily available commercial activity trackers. Evaluate the impact of using activity trackers to record number of inpatient steps taken after bariatric surgery and assess how patient characteristics may affect the number of steps recorded. University Hospital, United States. Using an activity tracker, the number of steps taken during the postoperative hospital stay was recorded for 235 patients undergoing either laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Patients were randomly assigned to either being informed about the devices' ability to record the number of steps taken or blinded to the purpose of the devices. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize study sample, a t test was used to compare number of steps recorded between groups, and a multivariate regression model was used to examine the effect of age, sex, preoperative body mass index (BMI), types of surgery, and length of stay on number of steps recorded. One hundred twenty-five patients (52.8%) were randomized to the blinded group while 111 (47.2%) were informed that the device would record the number of steps taken. There were no differences in the number of steps recorded between the 2 groups. Patients with prolonged length of stay recorded lower numbers of steps taken on postoperative day 0. Increasing age was seen to reduce the number of steps recorded on postoperative day number 1. There were no significant differences in number of steps recorded based on sex, preoperative BMI, or surgery type. The present study found that knowledge of an activity tracker being used did not affect the patient's activity level as measured by steps recorded. Increasing age correlated to reduced number of steps recorded on postoperative day 1 after bariatric surgery.",10.1016/j.soard.2020.08.033,,,,1136
426,Digital approach to informed consent in bariatric surgery: a randomized controlled trial.,"Informed consent is of paramount importance in surgery. Digital media can be used to enhance patient's comprehension of the proposed operation. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of adding a digital educational platform (DEP) to a standard verbal consent (SVC) for a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) on patient's knowledge of the procedure, satisfaction with the clinical encounter and duration of the consent appointment. This prospective non-blinded randomized controlled trial allocated 51 patients, who were candidates for a LRYGB, into DEP+SVC (intervention, nâ€‰=â€‰26) or SVC (control, nâ€‰=â€‰25) groups. Data were collected at one Bariatric Centre of Excellence (Ontario, Canada) between December 2018 and December 2019. DEP consisted of a 29-slide video-supplemented module detailing the risks, benefits, expectations and outcomes for the LRYGB. Primary outcome was knowledge about the LRYGB operation following the consent discussion. Secondary outcomes were knowledge retention, patient satisfaction, and duration of time required to obtain an informed consent. Baseline demographic data were equivalent between groups except for a greater proportion of male patients in the DEP+SVC group (7/19 vs 0/25; pâ€‰<â€‰0.01). Baseline procedure-specific knowledge was equivalent between the groups (72.3â€‰Â±â€‰11.3% vs 74.7â€‰Â±â€‰9.6%; pâ€‰=â€‰0.41). Post-consent knowledge was significantly higher in the DEPâ€‰+â€‰SVC vs SVC group (85.0â€‰Â±â€‰8.8% vs 78.7â€‰Â±â€‰8.7%; pâ€‰=â€‰0.01; ESâ€‰=â€‰0.72). The duration of time to obtain informed consent was significantly shorter for the DEPâ€‰+â€‰SVC vs SVC group (358â€‰Â±â€‰198Â sec vs 751â€‰Â±â€‰212Â sec; pâ€‰<â€‰0.01; ESâ€‰=â€‰1.92). There was no difference in knowledge retention at 4-6Â weeks (84.4â€‰Â±â€‰10.2% vs 82.9â€‰Â±â€‰6.8%; pâ€‰=â€‰0.55) and in patient satisfaction (31.5â€‰Â±â€‰1.1 vs 31â€‰Â±â€‰2.7; pâ€‰=â€‰0.10). The addition of a DEP online module to a standard verbal consent for LRYGB resulted in improved patient's understanding of the procedure-specific risks and benefits, high patient satisfaction, and over 50% time savings for the bariatric surgeon conducting the consent discussion.",10.1007/s00464-020-08277-x,,,,1137
657,Fracture Risk After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass vs Adjustable Gastric Banding Among Medicare Beneficiaries.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is associated with significant bone loss and may increase fracture risk, whereas substantial bone loss and increased fracture risk have not been reported after adjustable gastric banding (AGB). Previous studies have had little representation of patients aged 65 years or older, and it is currently unknown how age modifies fracture risk. To compare fracture risk after RYGB and AGB procedures in a large, nationally representative cohort enriched for older adults. This population-based retrospective cohort analysis used Medicare claims data from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2014, from 42â€¯345 severely obese adults, of whom 29â€¯624 received RYGB and 12 721 received AGB. Data analysis was performed from April 2017 to November 2018. The primary outcome was incident nonvertebral (ie, wrist, humerus, pelvis, and hip) fractures after RYGB and AGB surgery defined using a combination of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition and Current Procedural Terminology 4 codes. Of 42â€¯345 participants, 33â€¯254 (78.5%) were women. With a mean (SD) age of 51 (12) years, recipients of RYGB were younger than AGB recipients (55 [12] years). Both groups had similar comorbidities, medication use, and health care utilization in the 365 days before surgery. Over a mean (SD) follow-up of 3.5 (2.1) years, 658 nonvertebral fractures were documented. The fracture incidence rate was 6.6 (95% CI, 6.0-7.2) after RYGB and 4.6 (95% CI, 3.9-5.3) after AGB, which translated to a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.73 (95% CI, 1.45-2.08) after multivariable adjustment. Site-specific analyses demonstrated an increased fracture risk at the hip (HR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.82-4.49), wrist (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.33-2.14), and pelvis (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.08-2.07) among RYGB recipients. No significant interactions of fracture risk with age, sex, diabetes status, or race were found. In particular, adults 65 years and older showed similar patterns of fracture risk to younger adults. Sensitivity analyses using propensity score matching showed similar results (nonvertebral fracture: HR 1.75; 95% CI, 1.22-2.52). This study of a large, US population-based cohort including a substantial population of older adults found a 73% increased risk of nonvertebral fracture after RYGB compared with AGB, including increased risk of hip, wrist, and pelvis fractures. Fracture risk was consistently increased among RYGB patients vs AGB across different subgroups, and to a similar degree among older and younger adults. Increased fracture risk appears to be an important unintended consequence of RYGB.",10.1001/jamasurg.2019.1157,,,,1138
1235,Autonomic nervous system activity in diabetic and healthy obese female subjects and the effect of distinct weight loss strategies.,"Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are reported to be associated with relative overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which is reversible by weight loss. However, direct effects of weight loss by calorie restriction vs Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on SNS overactivity were not studied in parallel. This study compared the effects of RYGB vs restrictive weight loss in obese patients with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and with T2DM on SNS function as measured by heart rate variability (HRV). Lean (n=12), obese NGT (n=27) and T2DM (n=27) subjects were included in this study. Weight reduction in NGT subjects was achieved by gastric banding (GB) or RYGB and in T2DM subjects by RYGB or high-protein very-low-calorie diet (VLCD). HRV analysis was performed and blood samples were taken at baseline, 3 weeks and 3 months after intervention. At baseline, T2DM subjects showed SNS overactivity and NGT subjects showed similar, but non-significant, findings when compared with lean controls. Weight loss after 3 weeks was comparable in all treatment groups, whereas after 3 months, weight loss was most in VLCD and RYGB subjects. RYGB and VLCD treatment reduced SNS activity within 3 weeks in T2DM patients. After 3 months, restoration to normal autonomic nervous system activity was evident for all groups, except for the NGT-GB group. We can conclude that SNS overactivity is more pronounced in obese T2DM subjects when compared with NGT subjects. Reduction of SNS overactivity coincides with weight loss with the time-course of reduction dependent on the type of intervention. Surgery or caloric restriction may transiently induce SNS overactivity but do not prevent a direct restoration of sympathovagal balance.",10.1530/EJE-13-0506,,,,1139
81,Analysis of the Efficacy of Diet and Short-Term Probiotic Intervention on Depressive Symptoms in Patients after Bariatric Surgery: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo Controlled Pilot Study.,"(1) Background: studies have shown that some patients experience mental deterioration after bariatric surgery. (2) Methods: We examined whether the use of probiotics and improved eating habits can improve the mental health of people who suffered from mood disorders after bariatric surgery. We also analyzed patients' mental states, eating habits and microbiota. (3) Results: Depressive symptoms were observed in 45% of 200 bariatric patients. After 5 weeks, we noted an improvement in patients' mental functioning (reduction in BDI and HRSD), but it was not related to the probiotic used. The consumption of vegetables and whole grain cereals increased (DQI-I adequacy), the consumption of simple sugars and SFA decreased (moderation DQI-I), and the consumption of monounsaturated fatty acids increased it. In the feces of patients after RYGB, there was a significantly higher abundance of two members of the Muribaculaceae family, namely Veillonella and Roseburia, while those after SG had more Christensenellaceae R-7 group, Subdoligranulum, Oscillibacter, and UCG-005. (4) Conclusions: the noted differences in the composition of the gut microbiota (RYGB vs. SG) may be one of the determinants of the proper functioning of the gut-brain microbiota axis, although there is currently a need for further research into this topic using a larger group of patients and different probiotic doses.",10.3390/nu15234905,,,,1140
1551,The dose of succinylcholine in morbid obesity.,"The appropriate dose of succinylcholine (SCH) in morbidly obese patients is unknown. We studied 45 morbidly obese (body mass index >40 kg/m2) adults scheduled for gastric bypass surgery. The response to ulnar nerve stimulation of the adductor pollicis muscle at the wrist was recorded using the TOF-Watch SX acceleromyograph. In a randomized double-blind fashion, patients were assigned to one of three study groups. In Group I, patients received SCH 1 mg/kg ideal body weight, in Group II 1 mg/kg lean body weight, and in Group III 1 mg/kg total body weight. After SCH administration, endotracheal intubating conditions were scored. The recovery from neuromuscular block was recorded for 20 min. There was no difference in the onset time of maximum neuromuscular blockade among groups, but maximum block was significantly less in Group I. The recovery intervals were significantly shorter in Groups I and II. In one third of the patients in Group I, intubating conditions were rated poor, whereas no patient in Group III had poor intubating conditions. Our study demonstrates that for complete neuromuscular paralysis and predictable laryngoscopy conditions, SCH 1 mg/kg total body weight is recommended.",10.1213/01.ane.0000194876.00551.0e,,,,1141
1487,Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is associated with early increased risk factors for development of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis.,"Patients treated for obesity with jejunoileal bypass (JIB) experienced a marked increased risk of hyperoxaluria, nephrolithiasis, and oxalate nephropathy developing. Jejunoileal bypass has been abandoned and replaced with other options, including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Changes in urinary lithogenic risk factors after RYGB are currently unknown. Our purpose was to determine whether RYGB is associated with elevated risk of developing calcium oxalate stone formation through increased urinary oxalate excretion and relative supersaturation of calcium oxalate. A prospective longitudinal cohort study of 24 morbidly obese adults (9 men and 15 women) recruited from a university-based bariatric surgery clinic scheduled to undergo RYGB between December 2005 and April 2007. Patients provided 24-hour urine collections for analysis 7 days before and 90 days after operation. Primary outcomes were changes in 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion and relative supersaturation of calcium oxalate from baseline to 3 months post-RYGB. Compared with their baseline, patients undergoing RYGB had increased urinary oxalate excretion (31 +/- 10 mg/d versus 41 +/- 18 mg/d; p = 0.026) and relative supersaturation of calcium oxalate (1.73 +/- 0.81 versus 3.47 +/- 2.59; p = 0.030) 3 months post-RYGB in six patients (25%). De novo hyperoxaluria developed. There were no preoperative patient characteristics predictive of development of de novo hyperoxaluria or the magnitude of change of daily oxalate excretion. This prospective study indicates that RYGB is associated with an earlier increase in urinary oxalate excretion and relative supersaturation of calcium oxalate than previously reported. Additional studies are needed to determine longterm post-RYGB changes in urinary oxalate excretion and identify patients that might be at risk for hyperoxaluria developing.",10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2008.01.015,,,,1142
1484,Serum magnesium status after gastric bypass surgery in obesity.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) has become a common surgical procedure to treat morbid obesity. Furthermore, it strongly reduces the incidence of type 2 diabetes and mortality. However, there is scant information on how magnesium status is affected by RYGBP surgery. Previous bariatric surgery methods, like jejunoileal bypass, are associated with hypomagnesemia. Twenty-one non-diabetic morbidly obese patients who underwent RYGBP were evaluated before and 1 year after surgery and compared to a matched morbidly obese control group regarding serum magnesium. Groups were matched regarding weight, BMI, abdominal sagittal diameter and fasting glucose, blood pressure, and serum magnesium concentrations before surgery in the RYGBP group. The serum magnesium concentrations increased by 6% from 0.80 to 0.85 mmol/l (p = 0.019) in the RYGBP group while a decrease by 4% (p = 0.132) was observed in the control group. The increase in magnesium concentration at the 1-year follow-up in the RYGBP group was accompanied by a decreased abdominal sagittal diameter (r (2) = 0.32, p = 0.009), a lowered BMI (r (2) = 0.28, p = 0.0214), a lowered glucose concentration (r (2) = 0.28, p = 0.027) but not by a lowered insulin concentration (p = 0.242), a lowered systolic (p = 0.789) or a lowered diastolic (p = 0.785) blood pressure. RYGBP surgery in morbidly obese subjects is characterized by reduced visceral adiposity, lowered plasma glucose, and increased circulating magnesium concentrations. The inverse association between lowered central obesity, lowered plasma glucose and increased magnesium concentrations, needs further detailed studies to identify underlying mechanisms.",10.1007/s11695-008-9536-5,,,,1143
310,Parallel improvement of systolic function with surgical weight loss in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: a systematic review and patient-level meta-analysis.,"Morbid obesity (MO) is an increasingly common condition in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Although substantial weight loss in morbidly obese patients has proved to slow the progression of heart failure, parallel alteration of ejection fraction (EF) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class along with post-bariatric surgery weight loss is yet to be determined. This systematic review aimed to measure the effect of bariatric weight loss on EF and NYHA functional class in patients with HFrEF. A systematic literature review was performed in Medline/PubMed to identify studies in patients with MO and pre-existing HFrEF, who underwent bariatric surgery. A total of 11 studies encompassing 136 patients with HFrEF undergoing bariatric surgery for MO were included. Six studies provided patient-level data on 37 cases. Patients lost an average body mass index (BMI) of 12.9 Â± 4.2 kg/m2 (5.1 to 23 kg/m2) after an average follow up of 22.43 Â± 18.6 months (2-89 mo). There was a direct correlation between BMI loss and EF improvement (r = 0.61, P < .0001), but not between BMI loss and NYHA functional class changes (r = 0.17, P = .4). Weight loss induced by bariatric surgery results in parallel EF increase in patients with MO and HFrEF. However, current data does not indicate a parallel improvement of clinical symptoms (NYHA functional class) along with such an increase in EF in this population of patients.",10.1016/j.soard.2021.12.016,,,,1144
779,Effects of gastric bypass surgery followed by supervised physical training on inflammation and endothelial function: A randomized controlled trial.,"Obesity and physical inactivity are both associated with low-grade inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Bariatric surgery improves markers of inflammation and endothelial function, but it is unknown if physical training after bariatric surgery can improve these markers even further. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) followed by physical training on markers of low-grade inflammation and endothelial function. Sixty patients approved for RYGB underwent examinations pre-surgery, 6, 12, and 24 months post-surgery. Six months post-surgery, they were randomized 1:1 to an intervention group or a control group. The interventions consisted of two weekly sessions of supervised moderate intensity physical training for a period of 26 weeks. Fasting blood samples were analyzed for concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), tissue-type plasminogen activator antigen (t-PA:Ag) and von Willebrand factor (vWF). RYGB markedly improved markers of inflammation (IL-6, CRP) (pâ€¯<â€¯0.001) and endothelial function (ICAM-1, t-PA:Ag, vWF) (pâ€¯<â€¯0.05), and the improvements were sustained 24 months post-surgery (pâ€¯<â€¯0.01), except for the effects on vWF. We found no correlations between the changes in weight or BMI and the changes in markers of inflammation and endothelial function, except that the change in vWF was found to be inversely correlated with the changes in weight and BMI. We observed no effects of supervised physical training on markers on inflammation or endothelial function (p>0.1 for all). RYGB causes substantial and sustained favorable effects on markers of inflammation and endothelial function. Supervised physical training after RYGB did not cause additional improvements.",10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2018.04.002,,,,1145
355,Safety of Bariatric Surgery During the Opening Phase After the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Experience at an Academic Center.,"Increased morbimortality in patients with COVID-19 infection who had undergone surgery has raised concerns about bariatric surgery safety during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, there is scarce literature on safety outcomes after bariatric surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. To determine the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 infection and associated complications during the first 30Â days after bariatric surgery. Prospective observational cohort study including all patients who consecutively underwent primary bariatric surgery between August and December 2020. A total of 189 patients were included. Median age and BMI were 36 (17-70) years and 38 (35-41) kg/m2, respectively. Forty percent of patients were women (nâ€‰=â€‰76), 59.3% (nâ€‰=â€‰112) underwent sleeve gastrectomy (SG), and 40.7% (nâ€‰=â€‰77) underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). All surgeries were performed laparoscopically. The median length of postoperative stay was 2 (0-5) days. Postoperative COVID-19 infection was detected in two patients (1.1%): one patient was readmitted without the need of intermediate or ICU care, and the other was managed as an outpatient. Major complications occurred in three patients (1.6%); none of them was COVID-19 related. Two patients required an unplanned reoperation. No patient required intermediate or ICU care, no severe COVID-19 complications were observed, and no mortality was reported. Bariatric surgery can be safely performed during the ongoing pandemic, albeit a low risk of COVID-19 symptomatic infection. Rigorous perioperative COVID-19 institutional protocols are required to perform bariatric surgery safely during the current pandemic.",10.1007/s11695-021-05695-1,,,,1146
1018,Small Bowel Limb Lengths and Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: a Systematic Review.,"There is currently no consensus on the combined length of small bowel that should be bypassed as biliopancreatic or alimentary limb for optimum results with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. A number of different limb lengths exist, and there is significant variation in practice amongst surgeons. Inevitably, this means that some patients have too much small bowel bypassed and end up with malnutrition and others end up with a less effective operation. Lack of standardisation poses further problems with interpretation and comparison of scientific literature. This systematic review concludes that a range of 100-200 cm for combined length of biliopancreatic or alimentary limb gives optimum results with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in most patients.",10.1007/s11695-016-2050-2,,,,1147
703,IMPACT OF BARIATRIC SURGERY ON THE INFLAMMATORY STATE BASED ON CPR VALUE.,"PCR (C-reactive protein), produced in the liver after stimuli of inflammatory mediators, is determined as a marker of inflammatory activity (adipocytokines) and is present within adipocyte cells; besides being an inflammatory product, many studies have shown to be a predictor of complications. To determine if the inflammatory state of the obese patient decreases after bariatric surgery, based on pre and post-operative PCR. A prospective, observational study in patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric by-pass surgery followed up for three months after surgery, with serum preoperative CRP in 30, 60 and 90 days after surgery. A total of 19 patients, who had a mean CRP value before the surgical procedure of 0.80(Â±0.54) mg/dl, were followed, and when compared to the CRP with 30 days of surgery, they presented a significant increase to 2.68 mg/dl (p=0.012). When compared with the PCR of 60 days after the surgical procedure, it was also higher with the value of 3.32 mg/dl (p=0.27). However, at three months after surgery, the CRP showed a decrease when compared to the preoperative mark, with value of 0.45 mg/dl (p=0.0042). Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was able to decrease the chronic inflammation status of these patients, based on the value of CRP, with three months of surgery.",10.1590/0102-672020180001e1402,,,,1148
1188,Carotid intima-media thickness is reduced 12 months after gastric bypass surgery in obese patients with type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance.,"To investigate whether Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) - an in vivo model for normalisation of hyperglycaemia - improves carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D)/impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Observational prospective study, 34 obese patients (T2D (n = 14)/IGT (n = 4), and NGT (n = 16)) were investigated before and six and 12months after RYGB. Mean carotid IMT was significantly reduced 12months after RYGB in patients with T2D/IGT (-0.041 mm (95% CI -0.069; -0.012, p = 0.005)) but not in patients with NGT (-0.010 mm (-0.039; 0.020, p = 0.52)). The between-group difference was not significant (p=0.13). Twelve months after RYGB, patients with respectively T2D/IGT and NGT demonstrated changes in weight: -29.9 kg, p<0.001/-30.6 kg, p < 0.001, HbA1c: -0.7%, p < 0.001/-0.1%, p = 0.33, systolic blood pressure: -2 mmHg, p = 0.68/-10 mmHg, p = 0.01 and diastolic blood pressure: -8 mmHg, p = 0.003/-11 mmHg, p < 0.001. 80% of T2D patients terminated antihyperglycaemic medication. Mean carotid IMT was significantly reduced 12months after RYGB in patients with T2D/IGT which provides evidence to support that the earliest atherosclerotic changes in the arterial wall are reversible. Although numerically different from the changes observed in patients with NGT, the between-group difference was not statistically significant.",10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2014.03.005,,,,1149
1048,Accelerated protein digestion and amino acid absorption after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) involves exclusion of major parts of the stomach and changes in admixture of gastro-pancreatic enzymes, which could have a major impact on protein digestion and amino acid absorption. We investigated the effect of RYGB on amino acid appearance in the systemic circulation from orally ingested protein and from endogenous release. Nine obese glucose-tolerant subjects, with a mean body mass index (in kg/m(2)) of 39.2 (95% CI: 35.2, 43.3) and mean glycated hemoglobin of 5.3% (95% CI: 4.9%, 5.6%), were studied before and 3 mo after RYGB. Leucine and phenylalanine kinetics were determined under basal conditions and during 4 postprandial hours by intravenous infusions of [3,3,3-(2)H3]-leucine and [ring-(2)D5]-phenylalanine combined with ingestion of [1-(13)C]-leucine intrinsically labeled caseinate as the sole protein source of the meal. Changes in body composition were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. After RYGB, basal plasma leucine concentration did not change, but marked changes were seen postprandially with 1.7-fold increased peak concentrations (beforeâ€”mean: 217 Î¼mol/L; 95% CI: 191, 243 Î¼mol/L; 3 moâ€”mean: 377 Î¼mol/L; 95% CI: 252, 502 Î¼mol/L; P = 0.012) and 2-fold increased incremental AUC (before-mean: 4.1 mmol âˆ™ min/L; 95% CI: 2.7, 5.5 mmol âˆ™ min/L; 3 mo-mean: 9.5 mmol âˆ™ min/L; 95% CI: 4.9, 14.2 mmol âˆ™ min/L; P = 0.032). However, the postprandial hyperleucinemia was transient, and concentrations were below basal concentrations in the fourth postprandial hour. These concentration differences were mainly caused by changes in leucine appearance rate from orally ingested caseinate: peak rate increased nearly 3-fold [beforeâ€”mean: 0.5 Î¼mol/(kg fat-free mass âˆ™ min); 95% CI: 0.4, 0.5 Î¼mol/(kg fat-free mass âˆ™ min); 3 moâ€”mean 1.4 Î¼mol/(kg fat-free mass âˆ™ min); 95% CI: 0.8, 1.9 Î¼mol/(kg fat-free mass âˆ™ min); P = 0.002], and time to peak was much shorter (beforeâ€”mean: 173 min; 95% CI: 137, 209 min; 3 moâ€”mean: 65 min; 95% CI: 46, 84 min; P < 0.001). Only minor changes were seen in endogenous leucine release after RYGB. RYGB accelerates caseinate digestion and amino acid absorption, resulting in faster and higher but more transient postprandial elevation of plasma amino acids. Changes are likely mediated by accelerated intestinal nutrient entry and clearly demonstrate that protein digestion is not impaired after RYGB. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01559792.",10.3945/ajcn.115.109298,,,,1150
849,Efficacy of Goal-Directed Fluid Therapy via Pleth Variability Index During Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery in Morbidly Obese Patients.,"There is no well-recognized guideline for intraoperative fluid management in bariatric surgery. Goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) is a new concept of perioperative fluid management which was shown to improve patients' prognoses. Dynamic indicators may better predict fluid response compared to static indicators. In this study, we aimed to assess effects of administering GDFT protocol via Pleth Variability Index (PVI) in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. The study included 60 patients who underwent elective laparoscopic RYGB surgery. Subjects were randomized to two groups as being managed with either standard fluid regimen (control group) or PVI (PVI group) during intraoperative period. After induction of general anesthesia, control group received 500Â ml crystalloid bolus followed by 4-8Â ml/kg/h infusion. Fluid management of the control group was guided by central venous pressure and mean arterial pressure. PVI group received 500Â ml crystalloid bolus followed by 2Â ml/kg/h infusion. If PVI had been >Â 14%, 250Â ml colloid was administered. Norepinephrine was given by infusion to keep mean arterial pressure >Â 65Â mmHg, if needed. Perioperative lactate levels, hemodynamic parameters, and renal functions were recorded. In PVI group, volume of crystalloid and total fluid infusion during intraoperative period was significantly lower than the control group (pÂ <Â 0.05). The groups did not significantly differ in terms of lactate or creatinine levels before or after the surgery (pÂ >Â 0.05). There is no need to administer extra volume of fluid to obese patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Use of dynamic indicators like PVI helps to decrease intraoperative volume of infused fluids with no effects on either intraoperative or postoperative lactate levels in laparoscopic bariatric interventions.",10.1007/s11695-017-2840-1,,,,1151
862,Randomized trial reveals that physical activity and energy expenditure are associated with weight and body composition after RYGB.,"This study investigated the associations of both physical activity time (PA) and energy expenditure (EE) with weight and fat mass (FM) loss in patients following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. Ninety-six nondiabetic patients were included in this analysis. Post-RYGB patients were randomized in one of two treatments: A 6-month exercise training program (RYBG+EX) or lifestyle educational classes (RYGB). Body composition was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography. Components of PA and EE were quantified by a multisensory device. Dose-response relationships of both PA and EE with weight loss and body composition were explored according to quartiles of change in steps per day. Patients in the highest quartiles of steps per day change lost more FM (3rdâ€‰=â€‰-19.5 kg and 4thâ€‰=â€‰-22.7 kg, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) and abdominal adipose tissue (4thâ€‰=â€‰-313 cm2 , Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), maintained skeletal muscle mass (3rdâ€‰=â€‰-3.1 cm2 and 4thâ€‰=â€‰-4.5 cm2 , Pâ€‰<â€‰ 0.05), and had greater reductions in resting metabolic rate. Decreases in sedentary EE and increases in light EE and age were significant predictors of both Î”weight and Î”FM (R2 â€‰=â€‰73.8% and R2 â€‰=â€‰70.6%, respectively). Nondiabetic patients who perform higher, yet still modest, amounts of PA following RYGB have greater energy deficits and lose more weight and FM, while maintaining higher skeletal muscle mass.",10.1002/oby.21864,,,,1152
696,The Impact of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass on Bone Remodeling Expressed by the P1NP/Î²CTX Ratio: a Single-Center Prospective Cohort Study.,"Bariatric surgery seems to decrease bone mineral density and increase the risk of fatigue fractures. P1NP (bone formation) and Î²CTX (bone resorption) were recently validated as reference bone turnover markers (BTM). To assess changes in bone remodeling in severely obese patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) by using a new composite biomarker, the P1NP/Î²CTX ratio. We prospectively collected blood samples preoperatively, at 1Â month and at 1Â year from 114 consecutive RYGB patients from 12/2012 to 04/2014. Repeated measures ANOVA and multiple regression were used for data analysis. Cumulative incidence of fractures was assessed in 06/2018. The P1NP/Î²CTX ratio decreased significantly (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) from baseline to 1Â month and 1Â year (180â€‰Â±â€‰6.6, 110â€‰Â±â€‰4.1, and 132â€‰Â±â€‰5.4). The 1-year P1NP/Î²CTX ratio did not correlate with BMI or Î”BMI, but inversely correlated with age (râ€‰=â€‰-â€‰0.23, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.014) and with hsCRP (râ€‰=â€‰-â€‰0.26, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.009), even after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and lifestyle, and linearly correlated with albumin (râ€‰=â€‰0.2, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.037). At baseline, none of these correlations were detectable. Serum for all time-points was available from >â€‰94% of the patients. At a median follow-up of 4.7Â years, 8 patients (7.3%) had a bone fracture, all of them traumatic. Following RYGB, bone remodeling increases, with a shift toward degradation. This effect seems to be weight-loss independent and shows a correlation with age,Â with the level of systemic inflammation, and with nutritional state. The risk of fractures should be assessed systematically in bariatric patients and measures of prevention should be improved accordingly.",10.1007/s11695-018-03640-3,,,,1153
897,Prevalence of clinical thiamine deficiency in individuals with medically complicated obesity.,"Thiamine is a vitamin whose deficient can result in multiorgan symptoms. We described an 18% prevalence of clinical thiamine deficiency after gastric bypass surgery. Our hypotheses are that individuals with medically complicated obesity frequently have clinical thiamine deficiency and that diabetes mellitus is a mechanism for development of clinical thiamine deficiency. This is a single institution, retrospective observational study of consecutive patients with a body mass index of at least 35 kg/m2 who were evaluated in preoperative gastrointestinal bariatric clinic from 2013 to 2015. Each patient underwent a symptom survey. Clinical thiamine deficiency is defined by both (1) consistent clinical symptom and (2) either a low whole-blood thiamine concentration or significant improvement of or resolution of consistent clinical symptoms after receiving thiamine supplementation. After excluding 101 individuals with prior bariatric surgery or heavy alcohol consumption, 400 patients were included in the study. Sixty-six patients (16.5% of 400) fulfill a diagnosis of clinical thiamine deficiency, with 9 (14% of 66) having consistent gastrointestinal manifestations, 46 (70% of 66) having cardiac manifestations, 39 (59% of 66) having peripheral neurologic manifestations, and 3 (5% of 66) having neuropsychiatric manifestations. Diabetes mellitus is not a risk factor (P=.59). Higher body mass index is a significant risk for clinical thiamine deficiency (P=.007). Clinical thiamine deficiency is common in these individuals and a higher body mass index is an identified risk factor. Mechanisms explaining development of thiamine deficiency in obese individuals remain unclear.",10.1016/j.nutres.2016.11.012,,,,1154
483,Bariatric surgery in obese patients with ventricular assist devices.,"Patients with end-stage heart failure (ESHF) treated with ventricular assist devices (VADs) tend to gain weight, which may prevent them from receiving heart transplantation (HT) if their body mass index (BMI) reachesâ€‰â‰¥â€‰35Â kg/m2. The objective was to synthesize all cases available in the literature and describe the most important outcomes of bariatric surgery (BS) in VAD patients, including BMI trends, reaching a BMIâ€‰<â€‰35Â kg/m2, listing for HT, achieving HT, myocardial recovery, and mortality. These data were obtained for an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis and include available IPD for every case in the scientific literature describing VAD patients undergoing BS during VAD support with documented postoperative BMI (and time of measurement) during follow-up. These data include baseline, periprocedural, and long-term outcomes for the 29 patients meeting selection criteria. The composite outcome includes reaching a BMIâ€‰<â€‰35Â kg/m2, listing for HT, receiving HT, and myocardial recovery, indicating significant BMI loss associated with major ESHF outcomes. As multiple centers are becoming more experienced in this field, the present data can be merged with their databases to form larger samples that will allow to perform further statistical analysis to identify outcome predictors and improve clinical protocols and outcomes.",10.1186/s13104-020-05221-z,,,,1155
640,Stomach-partitioning gastrojejunostomy versus stent placement for the treatment of malignant gastric outlet obstruction.,"Gastric outlet obstruction is a complication of advanced tumors. It causes upper gastrointestinal obstruction, with progressive malnutrition and reduced survival. Currently, gastrojejunostomy or stent placement (SP) are feasible alternatives for the treatment of malignant gastric outlet obstruction. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and survival of both techniques. Single-center observational and prospective study of 58 patients with gastric outlet obstruction who underwent surgical treatment with stomach-partitioning gastrojejunostomy (SPGJ) or SP with self-expanding intraluminal prostheses between 2007 and 2018. Thirty patients underwent SPGJ and 28 SP. The mean age of the first group was significantly lower (69 vs. 78 years, respectively; P=.001). There were no statistically significant differences in terms of sex, perioperative risk or tumor etiology. Postoperative complications were non-significantly higher in the SPGJ group (P=.156). SP was associated with a shorter hospital stay (P=.02) and faster oral intake (P<.0001). However, SP had significantly higher rates of persistent and recurrent obstruction (P=.048 and .01, respectively), poorer energy targets (P=.009) and shorter survival (9.61 vs. 4.47 months; P=.008). SPGJ presents greater luminal permeability, better oral intake and greater survival than SP. SP is preferable for non-surgical patients with a limited short-term prognosis.",10.1016/j.ciresp.2019.04.013,,,,1156
1474,First experiences with A circular stapled gastro-jejunostomy by a new transorally introducible stapler system in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"The only effective treatment for patients with morbid obesity is surgery. Laparoscopic bariatric surgery has become quite popular in attempts to decrease the morbidity associated with laparotomy. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficiency by using SurgASSIST(R) for performing the gastrojejunostomy in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP). The variables were compared with the results using the standard laparoscopic circular end-to-end anastomotic stapler (CEEA(R)). After randomization, the gastro-jejuostomy of RYGBP was performed in ten patients by transabdominal introduced circular stapler (group A) and in ten patients by transorally introduced circular stapler (SurgASSIST(R); group B) via five-port laparoscopy. A prospective 12-month postoperative follow-up including documentation of minor and major complication as well as weight loss and body composition is done every 8 weeks. The average body mass index (BMI, 52 kg/m(2)) and the other baseline characteristics were equally distributed in both groups. There was no difference in reduction of BMI, excess weight loss, and fat mass in both groups. The rate of port site wound infection in group A was significantly higher (p = 0.03) when compared to group B. There was no anastomotic leak or stricture postoperatively in both groups. Performing of a gastrojejunostomy in RYGBP by SurgASSIST is a safe and feasible method in comparison to conventional circular stapler systems. The advantage of SurgASSIST is the avoidance to introduce the stapler through the abdominal wall and, by this, a possible port site wound infection. Further prospective studies have to be performed to verify the advantages of the SurgASSIST in comparison to conventional circular stapler systems.",10.1007/s11695-008-9661-1,,,,1157
1491,Significant analgesic effects of one session of postoperative left prefrontal cortex repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation: a replication study.,"In a recent preliminary trial in 20 patients after gastric bypass surgery, 20 minutes of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the left prefrontal cortex was associated with a 40% reduction in postoperative patient-controlled morphine use. As is the case with all novel scientific findings, and especially those that might have an impact on clinical practice, replicability is paramount. This study sought to test this finding for replication and to more accurately estimate the effect size of this brief intervention on postoperative morphine use and postoperative pain and mood ratings. Twenty participants who underwent gastric bypass surgery completed this replication and extension study. Beck Depression Inventory and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale scores were collected before surgery and at the time of discharge from the hospital. Immediately after surgery, participants were randomly assigned to receive 20 minutes of real or sham repetitive TMS (rTMS) (10 Hz, 10 seconds-ON, 20 seconds-OFF for a total of 4000 pulses). Patient-controlled morphine pump usage was tracked throughout each participant's postoperative hospital stay. In addition, pain and mood ratings were collected via visual analogue scales twice per day. Findings from the original postoperative TMS trial were replicated, as cumulative morphine usage curves were significantly steeper among patients receiving sham TMS, and participants receiving real TMS had used 35% less morphine at the time of discharge than participants receiving sham TMS. At the time of discharge, subjects who had received real TMS had used 42.50 mg of morphine, whereas subjects receiving sham TMS had used an average of 64.88 mg. When the data from the original preliminary trial were combined with the data from this replication trial, a significant difference in cumulative morphine usage was observed between subjects receiving real and sham TMS. Overall, participants who received real TMS used 36% less morphine and had significantly lower ratings of postoperative pain-on-average, and pain-at-its-worst than participants receiving sham. In addition, participants who received real TMS rated their mood-at-its-worst as significantly better than participants receiving sham. The effect of a single 20-minute session of TMS on postoperative pain and morphine use appears to be large (Cohen's d = 0.70) and clinically meaningful. Lastly, cross-lag correlational analyses indicate that improvements in mood follow improvements in pain by approximately 12 hours, supporting the notion that postoperative analgesic TMS effects are not driven by antidepressant effects. Although more research is needed to verify these observed effects independently, findings from the original postoperative TMS trial were replicated. TMS may have the potential to significantly improve current standards of postoperative care among gastric bypass patients, and further studies may be warranted on other surgical populations. Future investigations should use methodology that permits more definitive conclusions about causal effects of TMS on postoperative pain (for example, double-blinding, sham stimulation that is matched with real TMS with respect to scalp discomfort).",10.1016/j.brs.2008.04.002,,,,1158
1316,Effect of bariatric surgery-induced weight loss on renal and systemic inflammation and blood pressure: a 12-month prospective study.,"Bariatric surgery improves arterial hypertension and renal function; however, the underlying mechanisms and effect of different surgical procedures are unknown. In the present prospective study, we compared the 12-month follow-up results after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy on weight loss, hypertension, renal function, and inflammatory status. A total of 34 morbidly obese patients were investigated before, one and 12 months after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 10), laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (n = 13), and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (n = 11) for hypertension, kidney function, urinary and serum cytokine levels of macrophage migration inhibitory factor, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and chemokine ligand-18. At 12 months after surgery, the patients in all 3 treatment arms showed a significant decrease in the mean body mass index, mean arterial pressure, and urinary and serum inflammatory markers (all P < .001). The reduction in urinary and serum cytokine levels correlated directly with body weight loss (P < .05). Patients with impaired renal function at baseline (corresponding to serum cystatin C >.8 mg/L) had a marked improvement in renal function 12 months after surgery (P < .05). Surgically induced weight loss is associated with a marked decrease in renal and systemic inflammation and arterial hypertension and improvement in renal function in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. These effects appear to be independent of surgical procedure. The improvement in renal inflammation could be 1 of the mechanisms contributing to the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery on arterial blood pressure, proteinuria, and renal function.",10.1016/j.soard.2012.03.009,,,,1159
1426,Gastric bypass and On-Q pump: effectiveness of Soaker Catheter system on recovery of bariatric surgery patients.,"The continuous infusion of ropivacaine is effective in controlling pain for a wide variety of surgical procedures and reducing opioid adverse effects and dependency. The present study assessed the efficacy of ropivacaine infusion using the I-Flow dual Soaker Catheter system at the surgical site for bariatric surgery recovery at the Dallas Veterans Affairs Medical Center Hospital (Dallas, TX). We hypothesized that patients receiving ropivacaine would report lower levels of morphine requirement and pain, would have shorter hospital stays, and would return to ambulating faster than patients in the control group. A total of 45 patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups, with a target study population of 50 patients, receiving either .2% ropivacaine (n = 24) or saline solution (n = 21). Before incision closure, the surgeon infiltrated the surrounding tissues with 30 mL of ropivacaine (.5%) or saline solution. The catheter was then placed in both the subfascial space and subcutaneously. Next, the infusion pump was connected to the Soaker Catheters to complete the system design and deliver solution to the surgical site. No significant differences were found in the pain scores, morphine requirement, or length of stay between the 2 groups. The ropivacaine group interval to sitting up was one half day shorter than that of patients receiving saline (P = .038). Patients receiving ropivacaine were found to ambulate much more quickly than did the control group patients. This could be very beneficial in reducing the complications from blood clots and improving patient recovery and overall well-being after surgery by assisting with a quicker return to activities of daily living and reducing the dependence on the nursing staff.",10.1016/j.soard.2009.08.008,,,,1160
717,Multicentre cohort study of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy cessation after bariatric surgery.,"Few studies have assessed changes in antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy after bariatric surgery. The aim of this study was to assess the 6-year rates of continuation, discontinuation or initiation of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy after bariatric surgery compared with those in a matched control group of obese patients. This nationwide observational population-based cohort study used data extracted from the French national health insurance database. All patients undergoing gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy in France in 2009 were matched with control patients. Mixed-effect logistic regression models were used to analyse factors that influenced discontinuation or initiation of treatment over a 6-year interval. In 2009, 8199 patients underwent primary gastric bypass (55Â·2 per cent) or sleeve gastrectomy (44Â·8 per cent). After 6 years, the proportion of patients receiving antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy had decreased more in the bariatric group than in the control group (antihypertensives: -40Â·7 versus -11Â·7 per cent respectively; lipid-lowering therapy: -53Â·6 versus -20Â·2 per cent; both P < 0Â·001). Gastric bypass was the main predictive factor for discontinuation of therapy for hypertension (odds ratio (OR) 9Â·07, 95 per cent c.i. 7Â·72 to 10Â·65) and hyperlipidaemia (OR 11Â·91, 9Â·65 to 14Â·71). The proportion of patients not receiving treatment at baseline who were subsequently started on medication was lower after bariatric surgery than in controls for hypertension (5Â·6 versus 15Â·8 per cent respectively; P < 0Â·001) and hyperlipidaemia (2Â·2 versus 9Â·1 per cent; P < 0Â·001). Gastric bypass was the main protective factor for antihypertensives (OR 0Â·22, 0Â·18 to 0Â·26) and lipid-lowering medication (OR 0Â·12, 0Â·09 to 0Â·15). Bariatric surgery is associated with a good discontinuation of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy, with gastric bypass being more effective than sleeve gastrectomy.",10.1002/bjs.10999,,,,1161
1339,Daily vitamin supplementation and hypovitaminosis after obesity surgery.,"The objective of this study was to determine whether constant daily vitamin supplementation would be sufficient to prevent possible vitamin deficiencies in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The study was conducted on 58 men and women (mean age 41 Â± 10 y) who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass RYGB and were assessed preoperatively and at 3, 6, and 12 mo after surgery. During the postoperative period, the patients received a multivitamin-mineral supplement on a daily basis. Serum Î²-carotene and vitamin C were lower starting from the third postoperative month and continued to be low after 12 mo, and vitamin A was decreased by the sixth month and increased by 12 mo. Vitamin B12 levels were stable up to 6 mo but were decreased by 12 mo. Folic acid levels increased from the third month and remained higher throughout follow-up. One year after surgery there were 19% and 21% increases in the number of patients with vitamin A and vitamin C deficiency, respectively, and a 4% decreased of patients with folic acid deficiency. Weight loss and improvement in patients' general condition followed surgery, but serum levels of some vitamins were decreased despite the use of a vitamin-mineral supplement. These patients need continuous follow-up and individualized prescription of supplementation after the surgical procedure to prevent and treat vitamin deficiencies.",10.1016/j.nut.2011.07.012,,,,1162
1387,Obesity in adults.,"About one third of the US population and one quarter of the UK population are obese, with increased risks of hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis, and some cancers. Fewer than 10% of overweight or obese adults aged 40 to 49 years revert to a normal body weight after 4 years. Nearly 5 million US adults used prescription weight-loss medication between 1996 and 1998, but one quarter of all users were not overweight. We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments in adults with obesity? What are the effects of bariatric surgery in adults with morbid obesity? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We found 39 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: bariatric surgery versus medical interventions, biliopancreatic diversion, diethylpropion, gastric bypass, gastric banding, mazindol, orlistat (alone and in combination with sibutramine), phentermine, sibutramine (alone and in combination with orlistat), sleeve gastrectomy, and vertical banded gastroplasty.",,,,,1163
1644,Influence of a forced air warming system on morbidly obese patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Hypothermia during and after major abdominal surgery decreases host defenses, increases the incidence of coagulopathy and may alter blood pressure, cardiac contractility and myocardial stability. We designed a prospective randomized study to compare the benefits of a forced air warming system with warm blanket treatments in minimizing the effects of hypothermia on 64 morbidly obese patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Patients in the forced air warming group (n = 32) had significantly higher perioperative body core temperature, lower central venous pressure and blood pressure readings, lower incidence of shivering, less blood loss intraoperatively and achieved a higher post anesthesia Aldrete Score than those patients in the warmed blanket group (n = 32). The forced air warming system is safe, cost effective and beneficial in minimizing the undesirable consequences of hypothermia in morbidly obese patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.",10.1381/096089298765554359,,,,1164
1342,Changes in postprandial gut hormones after metabolic surgery: a comparison of gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy.,"Laparoscopic gastric bypass (GB) is reportedly more effective than laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in the treatment of patients with a low body mass index and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the mechanism remains speculative. We compared the postprandial gut hormone patterns between patients undergoing laparoscopic GB and laparoscopic SG at 2 years after surgery in a hospital-based, prospective study. A total of 16 laparoscopic GB and 16 laparoscopic SG patients were followed up and appraised for glucose homeostasis. Two years after surgery, the mixed meal test and gut hormones were evaluated in 13 laparoscopic GB and 13 laparoscopic SG patients who had been included in the previous randomized trial. The preoperative characteristics, such as body mass index, body weight, waist circumference, and duration of T2DM were comparable between the 2 groups. T2DM remission was achieved in 13 (81%) laparoscopic GB and 3 (19%) laparoscopic SG patients (P < .05) 2 years after surgery. The laparoscopic GB patients had lost more weight and had a smaller waist circumference and lower levels of glucose and hemoglobin A1c, and lower insulin resistance than the SG patients. Significant differences were found in acyl ghrelin, des-acyl ghrelin, cholecystokinin, and resistin between the 2 groups, but none in obestatin, gastric inhibitory peptide, glucagon-like peptide-1, and leptin. Both laparoscopic GB and laparoscopic SG have strong hindgut effects after surgery, but GB has a significant duodenal exclusion effect on cholecystokinin. The laparoscopic SG group had lower acyl ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin levels but greater concentrations of resistin than the laparoscopic GB group.",10.1016/j.soard.2011.07.009,,,,1165
1020,Novel ways to explore surgical interventions in randomised controlled trials: applying case study methodology in the operating theatre.,"Multi-centre randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in surgery are challenging. It is particularly difficult to establish standards of surgery and ensure that interventions are delivered as intended. This study developed and tested methods for identifying the key components of surgical interventions and standardising interventions within RCTs. Qualitative case studies of surgical interventions were undertaken within the internal pilot phase of a surgical RCT for obesity (the By-Band study). Each case study involved video data capture and non-participant observation of gastric bypass surgery in the operating theatre and interviews with surgeons. Methods were developed to transcribe and synchronise data from video recordings with observational data to identify key intervention components, which were then explored in the interviews with surgeons. Eight qualitative case studies were undertaken. A novel combination of video data capture, observation and interview data identified variations in intervention delivery between surgeons and centres. Although surgeons agreed that the most critical intervention component was the size and shape of the gastric pouch, there was no consensus regarding other aspects of the procedure. They conceded that evidence about the 'best way' to perform bypass was lacking and, combined with the pragmatic nature of the By-Band study, agreed that strict standardisation of bypass might not be required. This study has developed and tested methods for understanding how surgical interventions are designed and delivered delivered in RCTs. Applying these methods more widely may help identify key components of interventions to be delivered by surgeons in trials, enabling monitoring of key components and adherence to the protocol. These methods are now being tested in the context of other surgical RCTs. Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN00786323 , 05/09/2011.",10.1186/s13063-015-1127-x,,,,1166
715,Plasma concentrations of etonogestrel in women using oral desogestrel before and after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery: a pharmacokinetic study.,"To investigate whether Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) affects oral desogestrel (etonogestrel) pharmacokinetics. Single centre, open label, phase-2 pharmacokinetic study. University hospital of LinkÃ¶ping, Sweden. Fourteen women with planned RYGB surgery were included; nine women aged 18-45 years using 75 micrograms desogestrel completed the study. Steady-state etonogestrel pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were measured on three occasions for each individual (at 8 Â± 6 weeks before surgery, and at 12 Â± 2 and 52 Â± 2 weeks after surgery). Each patient served as her own control. On each occasion, serum samples were collected during a 24-hour period and etonogestrel concentrations were determined with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Area under the plasma concentration time curve of etonogestrel (AUC0-24 hours ). All women had significant postoperative weight loss. There were no significant differences in AUC0-24 hours , terminal half-lives (tÂ½ ), time to peak serum concentrations (Tmax ), or apparent oral clearances of etonogestrel (CLoral ) before and after gastric bypass surgery on any occasion. Peak serum concentrations (Cmax ) increased after 52 Â± 2 weeks compared with preoperative values (0.817 ng/ml versus 0.590 ng/ml, P = 0.024). To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effects on desogestrel pharmacokinetics after RYGB. This study did not reveal any clinically significant changes in etonogestrel pharmacokinetics, suggesting that oral desogestrel may be used by women after RYGB surgery. The sample size was limited, however, and therefore the results should be interpreted cautiously. The pharmacokinetics of oral desogestrel does not appear to change after gastric bypass surgery.",10.1111/1471-0528.15511,,,,1167
813,A randomized controlled trial of Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy vs. gastroduodenostomy with respect to the improvement of type 2 diabetes mellitus after distal gastrectomy in gastric cancer patients.,"The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of diabetes control induced by Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy(RY) vs Billroth-I reconstruction(BI) after distal gastrectomy in patients with early gastric cancer(EGC) and type 2 diabetes(T2DM). Forty EGC patients with T2DM, aged 20-80 years, who were expected to undergo curative distal gastrectomy were randomized 1:1 to RY(n = 20) or BI(n = 20). Diabetes medication status, biochemical and hormonal data including blood glucose, HbA1c, insulin, C-peptide, HOMA-IR, ghrelin, leptin, GLP-1, PYY, and GIP were evaluated for 12 months after surgery. Although pre- and postoperative 12-month fasting and postprandial glucose levels did not show a significant difference, HbA1c, C-peptide, and HOMA-IR levels were significantly improved at 12 months after surgery in both BI and RY groups. Sixty percent of RY patients and 20% of BI patients decreased their medication satisfying FBS<126 mg/dL and HbA1c<6.5% and 5% of BI patients stopped their medication satisfying the criteria of FBS<126 mg/dL and HbA1c<6.0%. The improvement patterns were more sustainable with less fluctuation in RY than in BI. On hormonal analysis, ghrelin and leptin levels were decreased and PYY and GIP levels were increased at 12 months after surgery in both groups without significant difference according to the reconstruction type and diabetic improvement status except ghrelin. In gastric cancer surgery, RY reconstruction showed better and more durable diabetes control compared to BI during the first year after surgery. Gastric cancer surgery led to decreased ghrelin and leptin and increased PYY and GIP, which might have a role in improving insulin resistance and glucose homeostasis.",10.1371/journal.pone.0188904,,,,1168

291,Sympathomimetic increases resting energy expenditure following bariatric surgery: A randomized controlled clinical trial.,"The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that ephedrine + caffeine (EC) reduces the fall in resting energy expenditure (REE) following bariatric surgery. This 32-week, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial included 142 patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) surgery. Participants were randomized to either EC or placebo for 27 weeks, beginning 5 weeks post surgery. The primary end points were change in REE (measured), percentage of predicted REE ([measured REE/Harris-Benedict equation-predicted REE] Ã— 100), and body composition. Secondary outcomes included change in percentage of weight. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded. The reduction in REE was smaller in the EC versus the placebo group, but it was not significant. Percentage of predicted REE was increased in the EC versus the placebo group (difference, mean [SE]: 5.82 [2.29], p = 0.013). Percentage of weight (difference: -3.83 [1.39], p = 0.007) was reduced in the EC versus the placebo group. Percentage of predicted REE was increased and body weight decreased in the EC-treated participants who underwent SG compared with those who underwent SG and were treated with placebo (difference in percentage of predicted REE = 8.06 [2.83], p = 0.006; difference in weight percentage = -4.37 [1.92], p = 0.025). Percentage of fat-free mass was increased in the SG participants treated with EC versus placebo (difference: 1.31 [0.63], p = 0.042). The most common AEs were anxiety, dizziness, insomnia, and tremors. Most AEs were not different from placebo by Week 32. EC enhances weight loss and reduces the fall in REE following bariatric surgery. Adrenergic symptoms mostly resolve over time.",10.1002/oby.23384,,,,1170
900,Stability of problematic eating behaviors and weight loss trajectories after bariatric surgery: a longitudinal observational study.,"The literature is rather mixed regarding the stability and the role of pre- and postoperative problematic eating behaviors (PEBs) on weight outcomes after bariatric surgery. To investigate the stability of loss of control (LOC) eating and picking and/or nibbling from pre- to postoperative assessments, and to investigate whether pre- and postoperative PEBs are predictors of different weight loss trajectories. Central Hospital, University, Portugal. This longitudinal study assessed LOC eating and picking and/or nibbling before and approximately 2 years after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass through face-to-face interviews and 2 self-report measures. Weight across follow-up time was retrieved from hospital charts. Of the 130 patients invited to participate in the study, 100 were assessed preoperatively, and of these, 61 were also assessed postoperatively. Frequency of PEBs is similar pre- and postoperatively (37.7% and 45.9%, respectively) (McNemar Ï‡2P = .832). Yet, about 40% ceased preoperative PEBs. Those with LOC preoperatively were more likely to develop picking and/or nibbling postoperatively (McNemar Ï‡2P<.05). About 39.5% developed PEBs de novo after surgery. The presence of PEBs postoperatively was a significant predictor of different weight loss trajectories after both laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Worse weight loss outcomes were found particularly at 17-20 months postsurgery. Preoperative PEBs were not a significant predictor. Our data do not support the stability of all PEBs across time, highlighting that the absence of preoperative PEBs does not preclude an unfavorable weight loss outcome after surgery. Postoperative but not preoperative PEBs are predictors of poorer weight loss trajectories after surgery.",10.1016/j.soard.2016.12.006,,,,1171
1635,Efficacy and safety of patient-controlled analgesia for morbidly obese patients following gastric bypass surgery.,"Adequate postoperative pain control is important to reduce potential cardiopulmonary complications. It is often difficult to determine dosages of narcotics for morbidly obese patients following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) due to respiratory depression. Individualization of analgesic therapy, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), can provide optimal dosage for pain control and minimize the side-effects. 25 morbidly obese patients who received PCA with morphine sulfate following RYGBP. PCA settings we re as follows: morphine, 20 microg/kg of ideal body weight, 10-minute lock out interval and 80 % of a calculated amount for a 4-hour limit. W e measured arterial blood gas, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, opioid amount, patient satisfaction, visual analog pain scale (VAS), and the incidence of nausea, vomiting, pruritus and sedation. Average morphine usage was 44.2+/-28.7 mg during the day of surgery (DOS); 49.1+/-27.4 mg during POD (postoperative day) #1; and 36.6+/-22.8 mg during POD#2 (p < 0.01). 24 patients were satisfied with their pain control on POD#1. VAS was 5.4+/-2.1 on the day of surgery, but remained below 4 thereafter. Arterial oxygen saturation and vital signs were maintained without significant changes. 5 patients experienced mild sedation on the day of surgery and 3 patients experienced mild sedation on POD#1. 1 patient experienced nausea and vomiting and 4 patients had pruritus; however, none required treatment. PCA is safe and effective for morbidly obese patients following RYGBP.",10.1381/096089200321668703,,,,1172
1585,Elevated liver enzymes following open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity - does timing of liver retraction affect the rise in the levels of transaminases?,"Liver retraction in open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) for morbid obesity may cause an elevation in liver transaminase levels postoperatively. This study attempts to ascertain whether timing of placement of the liver retractor would have any effect on the degree of derangement of the liver function tests. 12 patients undergoing open RYGBP were prospectively randomized into 2 groups. One group had the liver retractor applied early on in the operation, and had the gastric pouch constructed first, followed by construction of the jejunojejunostomy and Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy. The second group had the jejunojejunostomy performed first, followed by placement of the liver retractor to allow construction of the gastric pouch and Roux-en-Y gastro-jejunostomy. Liver function tests were monitored postoperatively in both groups, and these were then statistically analyzed with respect to the duration of liver retraction. Delayed liver retraction resulted in statistically significantly smaller increases in aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) compared with early liver retraction. AST levels returned to normal values within 1 week in both groups of patients. ALT levels returned to normal values within 1 week in the delayed liver retraction group, whereas levels took >1 week to return to normal in the early liver retraction group. Liver retraction causes abnormal transaminase levels following open RYGBP. Delayed liver retraction results in less rise in the AST and ALT levels compared with early liver retraction. Surgeons should construct the Roux-en-Y limb and jejunoje junostomy first, before proceeding with construction of the gastric pouch and gastrojejunostomy, thereby decreasing the duration of liver retraction and consequent relative liver ischemia.",10.1381/096089204323013505,,,,1173
700,Lack of Standard Definitions of Primary and Secondary (Non)responders After Primary Gastric Bypass and Gastric Sleeve: a Systematic Review.,"Lack of standard definitions of primary and secondary (non)responders after RYGB and SG makes it impossible to compare the literature.

MEDLINEÂ® was searched for literature published between 01-07-2014 and 01-07-2017 concerning (1) patients who received a primary RYGB or SG and (2) the outcomes of primary and secondary (non)responders. One hundred twelve out of 650 papers were eligible. Forty out of 47 papers described a definition of weight loss success. Sixty-seven out of 112 papers mentioned weight loss failure of which 42 described a definition, in total 23 different definitions. Weight regain was mentioned in 77 papers; only 21 papers provided a definition. The recent literature regarding definitions of these outcomes is highly inconsistent. To compare the literature international consensus is required.",10.1007/s11695-018-3610-4,,,,1174
1184,"Lower fetuin-A, retinol binding protein 4 and several metabolites after gastric bypass compared to sleeve gastrectomy in patients with type 2 diabetes.","Bypass of foregut secreted factors promoting insulin resistance is hypothesized to be one of the mechanisms by which resolution of type 2 diabetes (T2D) follows roux-en-y gastric bypass (GBP) surgery. To identify insulin resistance-associated proteins and metabolites which decrease more after GBP than after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) prior to diabetes remission. Fasting plasma from 15 subjects with T2D undergoing GBP or SG was analyzed by proteomic and metabolomic methods 3 days before and 3 days after surgery. Subjects were matched for age, BMI, metformin therapy and glycemic control. Insulin resistance was calculated using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR). For proteomics, samples were depleted of abundant plasma proteins, digested with trypsin and labeled with iTRAQ isobaric tags prior to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Metabolomic analysis was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The effect of the respective bariatric surgery on identified proteins and metabolites was evaluated using two-way analysis of variance and appropriate post-hoc tests. HOMA-IR improved, albeit not significantly, in both groups after surgery. Proteomic analysis yielded seven proteins which decreased significantly after GBP only, including Fetuin-A and Retinol binding protein 4, both previously linked to insulin resistance. Significant decrease in Fetuin-A and Retinol binding protein 4 after GBP was confirmed using ELISA and immunoassay. Metabolomic analysis identified significant decrease of citrate, proline, histidine and decanoic acid specifically after GBP. Greater early decrease was seen for Fetuin-A, Retinol binding protein 4, and several metabolites after GBP compared to SG, preceding significant weight loss. This may contribute to enhanced T2D remission observed following foregut bypass procedures.",10.1371/journal.pone.0096489,,,,1175
1636,Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a totally intra-abdominal approach--technique and preliminary report.,"Previous descriptions of a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, using a circular stapler to perform the gastrojejunal anastomosis, have employed the esophagus as a conduit to introduce the anvil of the stapling device into the stomach. The authors believe that the risk of injury to the esophagus, as well as the difficulty in maneuvering the anvil from the pharynx to the proximal part of the stomach, make this technique less than optimal. In other descriptions (in a porcine model) the anvil has been guided into position through a distal gastrotomy by attaching it to a Prolene suture on a straight needle and directing the needle toward a chosen site. Although the authors prefer this method because it avoids potential esophageal injury, they sought a technique that would be even more precise in anvil placement and would avoid pushing a needle across gastric mucosa. The authors have developed a method that is totally intra-abdominal and does not risk injury to the esophagus. The circular stapler is still used, thus giving a consistent, small opening through the gastrojejunal anastomosis. Over a 1-year period, 49 (of 50) patients underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with the described method. The average body mass index dropped from 42.63 to 34.12 over the first postoperative 3 months, with an average loss in excess body weight of 38.5%. The length of hospitalization following the procedure averaged 3.8 days, and the time to return to work (where applicable) was 11.9 days. This totally intra-abdominal laparoscopic technique is feasible and advantageous.",10.1381/096089299765552800,,,,1176
816,Changes in High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Efflux Capacity After Bariatric Surgery Are Procedure Dependent.,"High-density lipoprotein cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) is inversely associated with incident cardiovascular events, independent of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Obesity is often characterized by impaired high-density lipoprotein function. However, the effects of different bariatric surgical techniques on CEC have not been compared. This study sought to determine the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) on CEC. We prospectively studied severely obese, nondiabetic, premenopausal Hispanic women not using lipid medications undergoing RYGB (n=31) or SG (n=36). Subjects were examined before and at 6 and 12 months after surgery. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between surgical groups. Preoperative CEC correlated most strongly with Apo A1 (apolipoprotein A1) concentration but did not correlate with body mass index, waist:hip, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, or measures of insulin resistance. After 6 months, SG produced superior response in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and Apo A1 quantity, as well as global and non-ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1)-mediated CEC (P=0.048, P=0.018, respectively) versus RYGB. In multivariable regression models, only procedure type was predictive of changes in CEC (P=0.05). At 12 months after SG, CEC was equivalent to that of normal body mass index control subjects, whereas it remained impaired after RYGB. SG and RYGB produce similar weight loss, but contrasting effects on CEC. These findings may be relevant in discussions about the type of procedure that is most appropriate for a particular obese patient. Further study of the mechanisms underlying these changes may lead to improved understanding of the factors governing CEC and potential therapeutic interventions to maximally reduce cardiovascular disease risk in both obese and nonobese patients.",10.1161/ATVBAHA.117.310102,,,,1177
923,Beneficial Effects of Applying Low-Level Laser Therapy to Surgical Wounds After Bariatric Surgery.,"Bariatric surgery is a successful method for weight loss in cases of morbid obesity; however, as an invasive procedure, surgical complications may occur. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been increasingly used due to its effectiveness in controlling the inflammatory response, accelerating tissue repair, and reducing pain. The objective of this study was to investigate photobiomodulation effects after bariatric surgery and determine the laser actions during the inflammatory process, wound healing (clinical observation), and analgesia. This study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in which 85 patients underwent Roux en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) by conventional techniques (i.e., open surgery). Patients were divided into two groups and were irradiated with LLLT at 10 different points through the surgical scar in three sessions of applications: the laser group (laser-on) consisted of 43 patients who received the CW diode laser (MMOptics), while the placebo group (laser-off) consisted of 42 patients who were treated by the same protocol but with a disabled laser. Temperature was measured by a digital thermometer in both groups, and pain was evaluated using the visual analogue scale for pain. Biochemical analysis and digital images were used to document and evaluate the inflammatory response as well as tissue repair process at the surgical wound site. Patients in the laser group demonstrated diminished wound temperature as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) compared with the placebo group, indicating better inflammatory process control as well as improved wound healing and reduced pain. LLLT applied with the described protocol led to a decrease by biochemical markers and wound temperature compared with the placebo, which indicated that LLLT was able to control the inflammatory process; in addition, seroma and pain were reduced and cicatrization was improved by this preventive procedure.",10.1089/pho.2016.4149,,,,1178
1508,Gut hormones as mediators of appetite and weight loss after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"To evaluate the physiologic importance of the satiety gut hormones. Controversy surrounds the physiologic role of gut hormones in the control of appetite. Bariatric surgery remains the most effective treatment option for obesity, and gut hormones are implicated in the reduction of appetite and weight after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. We correlated peptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) changes within the first week after gastric bypass with changes in appetite. We also evaluated the gut hormone responses of patients with good or poor weight loss after gastric bypass. Finally, we inhibited the gut hormone responses in gastric bypass patients and then evaluated appetite and food intake. Postprandial PYY and GLP-1 profiles start rising as early as 2 days after gastric bypass (P < 0.05). Changes in appetite are evident within days after gastric bypass surgery (P < 0.05), and unlike other operations, the reduced appetite continues. However, in patients with poor weight loss after gastric bypass associated with increased appetite, the postprandial PYY and GLP-1 responses are attenuated compared with patients with good weight loss (P < 0.05). Inhibiting gut hormone responses, including PYY and GLP-1 after gastric bypass, results in return of appetite and increased food intake (P < 0.05). The attenuated appetite after gastric bypass is associated with elevated PYY and GLP-1 concentrations, and appetite returns when the release of gut hormones is inhibited. The results suggest a role for gut hormones in the mechanism of weight loss after gastric bypass and may have implications for the treatment of obesity.",10.1097/SLA.0b013e3180caa3e3,,,,1179
425,"Endoscopic ultrasound-directed transgastric ERCP (EDGE): a systematic review describing the outcomes, adverse events, and knowledge gaps.","BACKGROUNDâ€‚: Endoscopic ultrasound-directed transgastric endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (EDGE) has emerged as a viable completely endoscopic method for performing pancreaticobiliary interventions in patients with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass anatomy. The aims of this systematic review were: (1) to describe the indications, outcomes, and complications of EDGE; and (2) to identify deficiencies in our knowledge of important technical approaches and clinical outcomes. METHODSâ€‚: A systematic review was conducted via comprehensive searches of Medline, Scopus, CINAHL, and Cochrane to identify studies focusing on EDGE outcomes. Simple descriptive statistics were derived from case series only. Case reports were only included to qualitatively describe additional indications, techniques, and adverse events. RESULTSâ€‚: The initial search identified 2143 abstracts. Nine case series and eight case reports were included. In the nine case series, 169 patients underwent EDGE. The technical success rate was 99â€Š% (168â€Š/169) for gastrogastrostomy/jejunogastrostomy creation and 98â€Š% (166â€Š/169) for subsequent ERCP. Minor adverse events specifically related to EDGE occurred in 18â€Š% (31/169) and included intraprocedural stent migration/malposition (nâ€Š=â€Š27) and abdominal pain (nâ€Š=â€Š4). Moderate adverse events specific to EDGE occurred in 5â€Š% (9/169): including bleeding (2â€Š%), persistent fistula (1â€Š%), and perforation (1â€Š%). Severe adverse events occurred in one patient with a perforation requiring surgery. Deficiency in reporting on the clinical significance of adverse events was identified. CONCLUSIONâ€‚: Based on limited observational data, in expert hands, EDGE has a high rate of technical success and an acceptable rate of adverse events. As a novel procedure, many knowledge gaps need to be addressed to inform the design of meaningful comparative studies and guide informed consent.",10.1055/a-1376-2394,,,,1180
822,Cumulative Helicobacter Pylori Eradication Rates by Adopting First- and Second- Line Regimens Proposed by the Maastricht IV Consensus in Obese Patients Undergoing Gastric Bypass Surgery.,"Our aim was to assess, in obese patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, the cumulative Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication rates by adopting Maastricht IV guidelines in areas of high clarithromycin resistance rates (CLT)-14Â days concomitant first-line therapy with proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) bid, CLT 500Â mg bid, metronidazole (MTZ) 500 bid, and amoxicillin (AMX) 1000Â mg bid and 14Â days second-line therapy with PPI bid, AMX 1000Â mg bid and levofloxacin (LVF) 500Â mg od. Single-center prospective study was over 4Â years. Endoscopy and HP assessment (by histology or C13 urea breath test) were performed at baseline and post-treatment HP status was assessed by C13 urea breath test 4-6Â weeks after the end of therapy. Seven hundred seventy-seven consecutive HP-positive patients completed concomitant first-line treatment: 636 (81.9%) female, age 41.1 (Â±Â 10.2) years. HP was eradicated in 556 patients-71.56% (95% CI: 68.28-74.62%). In the remaining 221 patients, second-line LVF-based regimens eradicated HP in 121 patients-54.75% (95% CI: 48.16-61.18%). These results give 87.13% (95% CI: 84.58-89.31%) ITT and 89.43% (95% CI: 87.03-91.44%) PP cumulative eradication rates. Eradication rates were not significantly different by gender, age, endoscopy findings, and smoking habits. By adopting Maastricht IV consensus quadruple concomitant first-line treatment and second-line LVF-based therapy, high cumulative HP eradication rates are achieved but still leaves around 10.6% of obese patients undergoing RYGB in need of the culture and susceptibility testing prior to third-line treatment.",10.1007/s11695-017-2915-z,,,,1181
1174,Matched weight loss induced by sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass similarly improves metabolic function in obese subjects.,"The effects of marked weight loss, induced by Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) surgeries, on insulin sensitivity, Î²-cell function and the metabolic response to a mixed meal were evaluated. Fourteen nondiabetic insulin-resistant patients who were scheduled to undergo SG (nâ€‰=â€‰7) or RYGB (nâ€‰=â€‰7) procedures completed a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure and a mixed-meal tolerance test before surgery and after losing âˆ¼20% of their initial body weight. Insulin sensitivity (insulin-stimulated glucose disposal during a clamp procedure), oral glucose tolerance (postprandial plasma glucose area under the curve), and Î²-cell function (insulin secretion in relationship to insulin sensitivity) improved after weight loss, and were not different between surgical groups. The metabolic response to meal ingestion was similar after RYGB or SG, manifested by rapid delivery of ingested glucose into the systemic circulation and a large early postprandial increase in plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations in both groups. When matched on weight loss, RYGB and SG surgeries result in similar improvements in the two major factors involved in regulating plasma glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity and Î²-cell function in obese people without diabetes.",10.1002/oby.20803,,,,1182
651,Esophagogastric Neoplasms Following Bariatric Surgery: an Updated Systematic Review.,"The risk of gastric and/or esophageal cancers after bariatric surgery has been previously discussed in literature. A systematic review was performed to identify articles published between June 2012 and December 2018 reporting new cases of esophageal or gastric cancer not included in previous systematic reviews. Ten gastric malignancies, 28 esophageal cancers, and 2 gastro-intestinal stromal tumors (GIST) were identified. Primary bariatric surgery was a restrictive procedure in 26 cases, a purely malabsorptive procedure in 1 subject, and a gastric bypass in 13 patients. Although the vast majority of bariatric procedures seem to present a negligible relationship with any esophagogastric (EG) malignancy, published data remain incomplete.

Between 5/2004 and 12/2006, 136 patients (m:f = 0:4) with an average body mass index of 45 (35-58) kg/m(2) and age of 53 (21-66) years were prospectively analysed. Laparoscopic Roux-Y-gastric bypass (LRYGB) was performed in 86 patients and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) was performed in 50 patients. The patients were examined before surgery as well as 3, 6, 12, 24, 30, and 36 months postoperatively using a standard protocol including laboratory tests. The mean follow-up time was 24.4 (12-40) months; the follow-up rate was 100%. Prior to surgery, 57% of the patients had at least one deficiency, 23% of whom had vitamin D(3) deficiency. Frequent postoperative deficiencies after LSG were zinc, vitamin D(3), folic acid, iron, and vitamin B(12); after LRYGB, vitamin B(12), vitamin D(3), zinc, and secondary hyperparathyroidism. No vitamin B(1) or B(6) deficiencies were found. Calcium levels were normal in all patients. Treatment of the deficiencies was mostly successful. Preoperatively, 57% of morbidly obese patients already had a deficiency. Postoperatively, significantly more vitamin B(12) and vitamin D deficiencies and hyperparathyroidism were found in patients who had undergone LRYGB. After LSG, folate deficiency was more frequent (but not significantly so). Calcium levels were normal in all patients; therefore, parathyroid hormone and vitamin D(3) levels are more sensitive markers for early detection of disorders of calcium metabolism. Iron deficiency anaemia is most efficiently treated by IV therapy.",10.1007/s11695-009-0068-4,,,,1184
1073,Bowel obstruction rates in antecolic/antegastric versus retrocolic/retrogastric Roux limb gastric bypass: a meta-analysis.,"Previous literature is varied with regard to rates of bowel obstruction after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). Internal herniation through mesenteric defects is a common cause of bowel obstructions. There are advantages and disadvantages to routing the Roux limb via a retrocolic/retrogastric (RC/RG) versus an antecolic/antegastric (AC/AG) position. To review the literature comparing obstruction rates in RYGB using the antecolic versus retrocolic approach. Community-based integrated multispecialty health system with a teaching hospital serving 19 counties over a 3-state region. A literature search for articles published from 1994-2013 was completed. Articles were included if they reported an n>25, Roux limb route, obstruction rate by route, and follow-up duration. Statistical analysis included Ï‡(2) test by patient number. The initial search identified 241 articles; 8 met inclusion criteria. There were 4805 patients in the AC/AG group, and 2238 in the RC/RG group. Follow-up ranged from 0 to 68 months. A linear stapled technique was reported in 4231 (88%) patients in the AC/AG group and 1541 (69%) of RC/RG group. Handsewn closure of mesenteric defects was reported in 2152 (45%) patients in the AC/AG group and 1012 (45%) patients in the RC/RG group. Bowel obstructions occurred in 68 (1.4%) patients in the AC/AG group and 117 (5.2%) patients in the RC/RG group (P<.001). Internal hernias were reported in 65 (1.3%) patients in the AC/AG group and 52 (2.3%) patients in the RC/RG group (P<.001). Two mortalities were reported in the AC/AG group. Increased rates of bowel obstruction and internal hernia were observed in the RC/RG group compared with the AC/AG group. A prospective, randomized trial would be necessary to definitively determine the impact of Roux limb position and routine closure of mesenteric defects on bowel obstruction rates after gastric bypass.",10.1016/j.soard.2015.02.004,,,,1185
589,Fasting ghrelin levels after gastric bypass and vertical sleeve gastrectomy: An analytic cohort study.,"Neuronal populations involved in the regulation of food intake, particularly the orexigenic (appetite-stimulating) hormone ghrelin, are found in the hypothalamus. Changes in plasma ghrelin levels have been observed following different bariatric surgery procedures, but the results from different studies are contradictory. Much remains unknown regarding the role of ghrelin in the weight loss process following bariatric surgery. Our objective was to describe the behaviour of fasting ghrelin levels, comparing the changes occurring between 2 different surgical techniques (gastric bypass versus vertical sleeve gastrectomy) and their correlation with weight loss. A prospective, observational, analytic cohort study of 54 patients (27 for each surgical technique) with a 12-month follow-up period. We analysed demographic data, anthropometric data, comorbidities, weight loss and evolution of fasting ghrelin. The behaviour of acylated ghrelin was similar with the 2 surgical techniques, with no significant differences between gastric bypass and vertical sleeve gastrectomy. With both procedures, there was an increase in acylated ghrelin on day 5 and a subsequent decrease, and levels then gradually increased to reach values at 12 months that were higher than those reported preoperatively. This increase in ghrelin levels did not affect weight loss, since one year post-surgery, 30% weight loss was achieved with both types of surgery. We observed an increase in fasting acylated ghrelin levels at one year of follow-up with both surgical techniques, with 30% weight loss.",10.1016/j.endinu.2019.07.004,,,,1186
444,The Effect of an Exercise Intervention Program on Bone Health After Bariatric Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Exercise has been suggested as a therapeutic approach to attenuate bone loss induced by bariatric surgery (BS), but its effectiveness remains unclear. Our aim was to determine if an exercise-training program could induce benefits on bone mass after BS. Eighty-four patients, submitted to gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy, were randomized to either exercise (EG) or control group (CG). One month post-BS, EG underwent a 11-month supervised multicomponent exercise program, while CG received only standard medical care. Patients were assessed before BS and at 1, 6, and 12â€‰months post-BS for body composition, areal bone mineral density (BMD), bone turnover markers, calciotropic hormones, sclerostin, bone material strength index, muscle strength, and daily physical activity. A primary analysis was conducted according to intention-to-treat principles and the primary outcome was the between-group difference on lumbar spine BMD at 12 months post-BS. A secondary analysis was also performed to analyze if the exercise effect depended on training attendance. Twelve months post-BS, primary analysis results revealed that EG had a higher BMD at lumbar spine (+0.024â€‰gâˆ™cm-2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.004, 0.044]; p = .015) compared with CG. Among total hip, femoral neck, and 1/3 radius secondary outcomes, only 1/3 radius BMD improved in EG compared with CG (+0.013â€‰gâˆ™cm-2 [95% CI 0.003, 0.023]; p = .020). No significant exercise effects were observed on bone biochemical markers or bone material strength index. EG also had a higher lean mass (+1.5â€‰kg [95% CI 0.1, 2.9]; p = .037) and higher number of high impacts (+51.4 [95% CI 6.6, 96.1]; p = .026) compared with CG. In addition, secondary analysis results suggest that exercise-induced benefits may be obtained on femoral neck BMD but only on those participants with â‰¥50% exercise attendance compared with CG (+5.3% [95% CI 2.0, 8.6]; p = .006). Our findings suggest that an exercise program is an effective strategy to ameliorate bone health in post-BS patients.

774,"Effects of gastric bypass followed by a randomized study of physical training on markers of coagulation activation, fibrin clot properties, and fibrinolysis.","The risk of cardiovascular disease is reduced by bariatric surgery, but it is unknown if exercise after bariatric surgery reduces this risk even further. To investigate if Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass (RYGB) and supervised physical training after RYGB improve cardiovascular disease risk markers within coagulation activation, fibrin clot properties, and fibrinolysis. Bariatric center, Hospital of Southwest Jutland, Denmark. Sixty obese patients underwent RYGB and 6 months after RYGB were randomized to 26 weeks of physical training or a control group. Biomarkers within coagulation activation, fibrin clot properties, and fibrinolysis were measured presurgery, and 6, 12, and 24 months postsurgery. Six months after RYGB, the endogenous thrombin potential decreased from 1744 (1603-2003) to 1416 (1276-1582) nM Ã— min (P<.001). Alterations in fibrin clot properties resulted in an increased clot lysis from 23.8% (16.1%-38.9%) to 40.3% (28.5%-59.35; P<.0001). Furthermore, fibrinogen was reduced from 12.6 (11.1-14.7) to 11.5 (9.90-13.3) ÂµM (P<.001), and plasminogen activator inhibitor antigen was reduced from 40.5 (28.4-49.4) to 24.4 (15.4-32.7) ng/mL (P<.0001). Physical training after RYGB increased fibrinolytic activity from 58.0 (36.0-75.5) to 88.0 (66.0-132.0) IU/mL compared with 52.5 (30.0-80.0) to 64.0 (49.0-100.0) IU/mL in controls (P<.01) and reduced plasminogen activator inhibitor antigen from 23.5 (16.7-35.4) to 18.1 (14.3-25.4) ng/mL compared with 24.4 (13.9-28.7) to 24.2 (14.1-29.6) ng/mL in controls (P<.05). No effects of physical training were observed on markers of coagulation activation and fibrin clot properties. We observed favorable long-term reductions in markers of thrombin generation, improved fibrin clot properties, and increases in fibrinolysis after RYGB. Supervised physical training after RYGB further increased fibrinolysis.",10.1016/j.soard.2018.03.022,,,,1188
258,"PROBIOTIC SUPPLEMENTATION ATTENUATES BINGE EATING AND FOOD ADDICTION 1 YEAR AFTER ROUX-EN-Y GASTRIC BYPASS: A RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL.","The use of probiotics as adjuvants in the treatment of eating disorders, known as psychobiotics, has already been investigated as a means of modulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis. This study aimed to assess the effect of probiotic supplementation on binge eating and food addiction in subjects after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 101 patients who received probiotic (Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07) or placebo supplements for 90 days after bariatric surgery, starting on the seventh postoperative day. They were evaluated preoperatively (T0) and postoperatively at 90 days (T1) and 1 year (T2) after surgery. The Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) and Binge Eating Scale (BES) were applied to assess food addiction and binge eating, respectively. Before surgery, one-third of the patients presented with a food addiction and binge eating diagnosis. The number of symptoms of YFAS and the BES score decreased significantly in both groups at T1 compared to T0. However, a significant effect of treatment with probiotics was observed 1 year after surgery (T2). Both the number of symptoms of food addiction and the binge eating score were lower in the probiotic group than in the placebo group (p=0.037 and p=0.030, respectively). The use of probiotic supplementation for 90 days in the immediate postoperative period may decrease food addiction symptoms and binge eating score up to 1 year after surgery compared to controls.",10.1590/0102-672020210002e1659,,,,1189
1313,"Sensory impairment in obese patients? Sensitivity and pain detection thresholds for electrical stimulation after surgery-induced weight loss, and comparison with a nonobese population.","Obese patients have a high prevalence of painful musculoskeletal disorders that may decrease after massive weight loss. Pain thresholds may be different in obese participants. To assess the sensitivity and pain detection thresholds, through the application of an electrical sensitivity, before and after massive weight loss, and to compare the thresholds obtained with those in a control population. The sensitivity and pain detection thresholds obtained in participants subjected to electrical stimulation were determined in 31 obese individuals (age: 40.3 Â± 10.5 y) before (body mass index: 45.7 Â± 6.8 kg/m) and 6 months after a mean weight loss of 32 kg induced by gastric bypass. The results obtained were compared with those for 49 nonobese control participants (38.5 Â± 11.2 y; body mass index: 22.6 Â± 2.6 kg/m). Body composition and metabolic biomarkers, such as leptin, adiponectin, insulin, and interleukin 6, were assessed and single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the mu opioid receptor [OPRM1 (c.118A > G) and COMT (p.Val158Met)] were genotyped in obese patients. Sensitivity and pain detection thresholds (3.9 Â± 1.1; 11.6 Â± 6.0) were significantly higher in obese than in nonobese participants (3.1 Â± 1.1; 6.0 Â± 3.0), respectively (P < 0.0001), and were not affected by drastic weight loss (mean change: 32 kg). Pain thresholds in obese participants were not correlated with any of the clinical and biological variables studied. The obese participants in the highest quartile for both sensitivity and pain detection thresholds were significantly older than those in the lowest quartile. Further studies are required to explore sensory dysfunction in obese individuals and to investigate the implications of this dysfunction for pain management.",10.1097/AJP.0b013e31824786ad,,,,1190
1069,Baseline of visceral fat area and decreased body weight correlate with improved pulmonary function after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in Chinese obese patients with BMI 28-35 kg/mÂ² and type 2 diabetes: a 6-month follow-up.,"Associations between demographic data and pulmonary function have not been adequately examined in patients that underwent Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB). This study was designed to examine changes in body fat distribution and metabolic parameters after RYGB and whether these changes correlated with improved lung function. A retrospective review of 32 ethnic Chinese with obesity with body mass index (BMI) 28-35 kg/m(2) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) was conducted, focusing on metabolic outcomes and pulmonary function 6 months after RYGB. Forced expiratory volume during first second (FEV1), percentage of forced expiratory volume during first second (FEV1 [%pred]), forced vital capacity (FVC), and percentage of forced vital capacity (FVC [%pred]) all improved significantly after RYGB. These increases all were negatively correlated with decreases in body weight and visceral fat area (VFA). The improvements of FEV1, FEV1 [%pred] and FVC were also negatively correlated with baseline of body weight and VFA. Furthermore, increases in FEV1 and FVC were independently associated with baseline of VFA (Î²â€‰=â€‰-0.003, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.000; Î²â€‰=â€‰-0.004, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.002, respectively).

1661,Dietary intake before and after gastric bypass and gastroplasty for morbid obesity in women.,Fifty-one morbidly obese women were randomized to surgical treatment with gastric bypass (GBY) or gastroplasty (GPL). Their dietary intake was assessed preoperatively and 12 months postoperatively by two methods: diet history and 4-day weighted intake. Their protein intake was also checked against urinary nitrogen losses. There was a good correspondence between the results of the two dietary methods and also between estimated protein intake and urinary loss. This makes the results reliable. After 1 year the GBY patients demonstrated a mean weight loss of 41.6 +/- 10.8 kg (P less than 0.001 versus GPL) and a mean energy intake preoperatively of about 2400 kcal/day and postoperatively of 1050 kcal/day (P less than 0.05 versus GPL). The GPL patients lost 28.9 +/- 9.6 kg as a mean and had a preoperative intake of about 2500 kcal/day and a postoperative intake of about 1300 kcal/day. There were only minor changes in the quality of the food from the preoperative to the postoperative situation. Postoperatively the daily intake of several nutrients was below minimum values of recommended or required intake.,,,,,1192
406,Long-term Emergency Department Visits and Readmissions After Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: a Systematic Review.,"There is considerable evidence on short-term outcomes after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), but data on long-term outcome is scarce, especially on postoperative emergency department (ED) visits and readmissions. We aim to systematically review evidence on the incidence, indications, and risk factors of ED visits and readmissions beyond 30 days after LRYGB. A systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, Embase.com , Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO was performed. All studies reporting ED visits and readmissions > 30 days after LRYGB, with â‰¥ 50 patients, were included. PRISMA statement was used and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for quality assessment. Twenty articles were included. Six studies reported on ED visits (n = 2818) and 19 on readmissions (n = 276,543). The rate of patients with an ED visit within 90 days after surgery ranged from 3.9 to 32.6%. ED visits at 1, 2, and 3 years occurred in 25.6%, 30.0%, and 31.1% of patients. Readmissions within 90 days and at 1-year follow-up ranged from 4.1 to 20.5% and 4.75 to 16.6%, respectively. Readmission was 29% at 2 years and 23.9% at 4.2 years of follow-up. The most common reason for ED visits and readmissions was abdominal pain. Emergency department visits and readmissions have been reported in up to almost one in three patients on the long-term after LRYGB. Both are mainly indicated for abdominal pain. The report on indications and risk factors is very concise. A better understanding of ED visits and readmissions after LRYGB is warranted to improve long-term care, in particular for patients with abdominal pains.",10.1007/s11695-021-05286-0,,,,1193
1642,Iron absorption and therapy after gastric bypass.,"Iron deficiency anemia is a common complication of gastric bypass. The authors assessed the value of taking vitamin C with oral iron in correcting deficiencies in iron stores and anemia postoperatively. Iron absorption tests were performed on 55 patients 3.2+/-2.0 years after isolated gastric bypass to identify those at higher risk for the late development of anemia. Twenty-nine of this group agreed to a therapeutic trial of iron alone or with vitamin C over a 2-month period. All 55 patients were followed up for 27.1+/-1.0 months following the study. The iron absorption test identified patients with low iron stores, as indicated by low serum ferritin, and those with sufficient absorption surface to benefit from oral iron. The addition of vitamin C appears to enhance the therapeutic effect of iron by correcting ferritin deficits (P < 0.01) and anemia (P < 0.05). Differences in intestine length bypassed by the operation (10 vs. 100 cm) did not affect late ferritin and hemoglobin values. This study suggests but does not prove that the addition of vitamin C to iron therapy after gastric bypass is more effective in restoring ferritin and hemoglobin than iron alone. These results are in contrast with the outcome 22.8 months later, when approximately 50% of study patients were again anemic. Closer follow-up of patients is urgently needed.",10.1381/096089299765553656,,,,1194
891,Comparison of economic and clinical outcomes between patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery with powered versus manual endoscopic surgical staplers.,"To compare economic and clinical outcomes between patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRY) or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) with use of powered vs manual endoscopic surgical staplers. Patients (aged â‰¥21 years) who underwent LRY or LSG during a hospital admission (January 1, 2012-September 30, 2015) were identified from the Premier Perspective Hospital Database. Use of powered vs manual staplers was identified from hospital administrative billing records. Multivariable analyses were used to compare the following outcomes between the powered and manual stapler groups, adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics and hospital-level clustering: hospital length of stay (LOS), total hospital costs, medical/surgical supply costs, room and board costs, operating room costs, operating room time, discharge status, bleeding/transfusion during the hospital admission, and 30, 60, and 90-day all-cause readmissions. The powered and manual stapler groups comprised 9,851 patients (mean ageâ€‰=â€‰44.6 years; 79.3% female) and 21,558 patients (mean ageâ€‰=â€‰45.0 years; 78.0% female), respectively. In the multivariable analyses, adjusted mean hospital LOS was 2.1 days for both the powered and manual stapler groups (pâ€‰=â€‰.981). Adjusted mean total hospital costs ($12,415 vs $13,547, pâ€‰=â€‰.003), adjusted mean supply costs ($4,629 vs $5,217, pâ€‰=â€‰.011), and adjusted mean operating room costs ($4,126 vs $4,413, pâ€‰=â€‰.009) were significantly lower in the powered vs manual stapler group. The adjusted rate of bleeding and/or transfusion during the hospital admission (2.46% vs 3.22%, pâ€‰=â€‰.025) was significantly lower in the powered vs manual stapler group. The adjusted rates of 30, 60, and 90-day all-cause readmissions were similar between the groups (all pâ€‰>â€‰.05). Sub-analysis by manufacturer showed similar results. This observational study cannot establish causal linkages. In this analysis of patients who underwent LRY or LSG, the use of powered staplers was associated with better economic outcomes, and a lower rate of bleeding/transfusion vs manual staplers in the real-world setting.",10.1080/13696998.2017.1296453,,,,1195

Bariatric surgeries like Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) have been effective in promoting weight loss and improving type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management.&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aim:&lt;/b&gt; The aim was to determine whether Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is more effective than vertical sleeve gastrectomy in the remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed. A literature search was performed in the databases Web of Science, Medline/PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Medline/Ovid. A total of 1323 results were identified; after screening, 14 articles were selected and included in the systematic review. Primary and secondary outcomes were measured by RR with a 95% CI.&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The primary outcome of T2DM remission was 15% in favor of VSG (RR: 1.15, [95% CI: 1.04-1.28]). For secondary outcomes, hypertension remission was 7% in favor of VSG (RR: 1.07, [95% CI: 1.00-1.16]). Remission of dyslipidemia was 16% in favor of VSG (RR: 1.16, [95% CI: 1.06-1.26]). BMI after surgery was in favor of RYGB (MD: -1.31, [95% CI: -1.98 to -0.64]). For weight loss, the results favored VSG (MD: 6.50, [95% CI: 4.99-8.01]). In relation to total cholesterol, they were 65% favorable for RYGB (MD: -0.35, [95% CI: -0.46 to -0.24]), with a value of p &lt;0.05. For LDL values, our results were 69% favorable for RYGB (MD: -0.31, [95% CI: -0.45 to -0.16]), p &lt;0.01 value.&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is more effective in T2DM remission, hypertension remission, dyslipidemia remission, and weight loss compared to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is more effective at lowering BMI, total cholesterol, LDL, and TG compared to laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.&lt;/br&gt.",10.5604/01.3001.0054.2674,,,,1196
1646,"Prophylactic iron supplementation after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a prospective, double-blind, randomized study.","To determine whether prophylactic oral iron supplements (320 mg twice daily) would protect women from iron deficiency and anemia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Prospective, double-blind, randomized study in which 29 patients received oral iron and 27 patients received a placebo beginning 1 month after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Tertiary care medical center. Complete blood cell count and serum levels of iron, total iron binding capacity, ferritin, vitamin B12, and folate were determined preoperatively and at 6-month intervals postoperatively in 56 menstruating women who had Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Incidence of iron deficiency and other hematological abnormalities in each treatment group. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and vitamin B12 levels were significantly decreased compared with preoperative values in both groups. Conversely, folate levels increased significantly over time in both groups. Oral iron consistently prevented development of iron deficiency in the iron group. Ferritin levels did not change significantly in the iron group. However, in placebo-treated patients, ferritin levels 2 years postoperatively were significantly decreased compared with preoperative levels. There was no difference in the incidence of anemia between the 2 groups. However, the incidence of microcytosis was substantially greater (P=.07) in placebo-treated than iron-treated patients. Prophylactic oral iron supplements successfully prevented iron deficiency in menstruating women after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass but did not consistently protect these women from developing anemia. On the basis of these results we now routinely recommend prophylactic iron supplements to menstruating women who have Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.",10.1001/archsurg.133.7.740,,,,1197
1537,Prospective randomized trial of heated humidified versus cold dry carbon dioxide insufflation during laparoscopic gastric bypass.,"The replacement of cold dry carbon dioxide with heated humidified gas for insufflation during complex laparoscopic procedures has been reported to decrease hypothermia and peritoneal cell desiccation, with a resultant decrease in postoperative pain and narcotic use and a shortened recovery, but may prevent the paralysis of the peritoneal polymorphonuclear cell cytokine cascade and add to the cost of the procedure. We report our outcomes comparing carbon dioxide insufflation with different characteristics during laparoscopic gastric bypass. Fifty consecutive patients were randomized to undergo laparoscopic gastric bypass with either cold-dry or heated-humidified carbon dioxide insufflation. Statistical analysis of variance between groups was determined by Levine's t test with the Greenhouse-Geisser correction, at a significance level of P <.05. The two groups were similar for preoperative gender, age, weight, body mass index, and baseline C-reactive protein. The intraoperative room and patient core temperature, liters of insufflation used, lens cleanings, operating time, recovery room time, and narcotics used were not significantly different. The postoperative subjective analog shoulder pain score was significantly less (P = .025) for the heated-humidified group at 18 hours, but not at 6, 12, 24, or 48 hours. The abdominal pain scores and overall narcotic use, postoperative C-reactive protein, and length of stay were not significantly different between the two groups. Heated-humidified insufflation resulted in a transient reduction in subjective shoulder pain at 18 hours postoperatively, but no reduction in abdominal pain or narcotics used. We were unable to verify any clinically significant difference between the two groups comparing heated-humidified and cold-dry insufflation after laparoscopic gastric bypass.",10.1016/j.soard.2006.01.013,,,,1198
1442,Should dosing of rocuronium in obese patients be based on ideal or corrected body weight?,"Pharmacokinetic studies in obese patients suggest that dosing of rocuronium should be based on ideal body weight (IBW). This may, however, result in a prolonged onset time or compromised conditions for tracheal intubation. In this study, we compared onset time, conditions for tracheal intubation, and duration of action in obese patients when the intubation dose of rocuronium was based on three different weight corrections. Fifty-one obese patients, with a median (range) body mass index of 44 (34-72) kg/m2, scheduled for laparoscopic gastric banding or gastric bypass under propofol-remifentanil anesthesia were randomized into three groups. The patients received rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) based on IBW (IBW group, n = 17), IBW plus 20% of excess weight (corrected body weight [CBW]20% group, n = 17), or IBW plus 40% of excess weight (CBW40% group, n = 17). Propofol was administered as a bolus of 200 mg and an infusion at 5 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) and remifentanil was administered at 1.0 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1), both according to CBW40%. Neuromuscular function was monitored with train-of-four nerve stimulation and acceleromyography. The primary end point was duration of action, defined as time to reappearance of the fourth twitch in train-of-four. The median (range) duration of action was 32 (18-49), 38 (25-66), and 42 (24-66) min in the IBW, CBW20%, and CBW40% groups, respectively (P = 0.001 for comparison of the IBW and CBW40% group). There were no significant differences in onset time (85 vs 84 vs 80 s) or in intubation conditions 90 s after administration of rocuronium. In obese patients undergoing gastric banding or gastric bypass, rocuronium dosed according to IBW provided a shorter duration of action without a significantly prolonged onset time or compromised conditions for tracheal intubation.",10.1213/ane.0b013e3181b0826a,,,,1199
1654,"A multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, prospective trial of prophylactic ursodiol for the prevention of gallstone formation following gastric-bypass-induced rapid weight loss.","Previous studies have documented a high incidence of gallstone formation following gastric-bypass (GBP)-induced rapid weight loss in morbidly obese patients. This study was designed to determine if a 6-month regimen of prophylactic ursodiol might prevent the development of gallstones. A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, prospective trial evaluated 3 oral doses of ursodiol: 300, 600, and 1,200 mg versus placebo beginning within 10 days after surgery and continuing for 6 months or until gallstone development, for patients with a body mass index (BMI) > or = 40 kg/m2. All patients had normal intraoperative gallbladder sonography. Transabdominal sonography was obtained at 2, 4, and 6 months following surgery, or until gallstone formation. Of 233 patients with at least one postoperative sonogram, 56 were randomized to placebo, 53 to 300 mg ursodiol, 61 to 600 mg ursodiol, and 63 to 1,200 mg ursodiol. Preoperative age, sex, race, weight, BMI, and postoperative weight loss were not significantly different between groups. Gallstone formation occurred at 6 months in 32%, 13%, 2%, and 6% of the patients on the respective doses. Gallstones were significantly (P < 0.001) less frequent with ursodiol 600 and 1,200 mg than with placebo. A daily dose of 600 mg ursodiol is effective prophylaxis for gallstone formation following GBP-induced rapid weight loss.",10.1016/s0002-9610(99)80115-9,,,,1200
698,Comparison of Energy and Food Intake Between Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy: a Meta-analysis and Systematic Review.,"AbstractObesity is a developed nutritional problem, and today, surgery is one of the approaches to cure it. A good understanding of the variations in food intake will be beneficial for sustaining long-term weight loss post-surgery and for improving nutrition care strategies. The purpose of this review was the comparison of the impact of two methods of gastric bypass (GBP) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) on dietary intake. Databases of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of science were used for the literature search up to June 2018. We concluded the studies that measured mean daily energy intake and the percent of macronutrients from total calorie intake of before and after GBP and SG. A total of 18 studies were finally included in the meta-analysis for the effect of bariatric surgery on food intake. Bariatric surgery significantly decreased energy intake by 1050.04Â kcal/day (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) compared with the baseline values of energy intake. The pooled effect of bariatric surgery on protein intake was 0.82Â g/day (pâ€‰=â€‰0.004) compared with the baseline values. The pooled analysis found no significant impact of bariatric surgery on carbohydrate intake (WMDâ€‰=â€‰0.56Â g/day; pâ€‰=â€‰0.40) compared with the baseline values. The pooled estimate of effect for bariatric surgery on fat intake was -â€‰1.34Â g/day (pâ€‰=â€‰0.006). This study demonstrates that bariatric surgery might be effective on energy and fat intake; however, there was no effect on carbohydrate intake.",10.1007/s11695-018-03663-w,,,,1201
981,Effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy on taste acuity and sweetness acceptability in postsurgical subjects.,"Data on taste acuity after bariatric surgery are scarce, and taste perception after sleeve gastrectomy, to our knowledge, has never been investigated. The objective of this work was to retrospectively compare taste acuity and sweetness acceptability after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. Subjects with a postoperative period â‰¥6Â mo were recruited (between January and June 2012) for a non-randomized, observational study. Subjects completed sensory evaluation sessions consisting of measurement of detection thresholds for bitterness and sweetness (NÂ =Â 21), saltiness and sourness (NÂ =Â 19), and sweetness acceptability (NÂ =Â 19). Significance was established with Tukey's honest significant difference test and analysis of variance using the SAS GLM procedure. Sourness threshold was significantly higher among subjects who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (PÂ =Â 0.0045). No other differences were obtained for the other thresholds or sweetness acceptability (PÂ >Â 0.05). Further randomized studies are needed to clarify these differences.",10.1016/j.nut.2016.03.022,,,,1202
1167,Hyperinsulinemic syndrome: the metabolic syndrome is broader than you think.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by hyperinsulinemia. In 2011 we showed that gastric bypass (RYGB) corrects these high levels even though insulin resistance remains high, ie, the operation ""dissociates"" hyperinsulinemia from insulin resistance. RYGB produces reversal of T2DM along with other diseases associated with the metabolic syndrome. This observation led us to examine whether these illnesses also were characterized by hyperinsulinemia. A systematic review was performed to determine whether hyperinsulinemia was present in disorders associated with the metabolic syndrome. We reviewed 423 publications. 58 were selected because of appropriate documentation of insulin measurements. Comparisons were based on whether the studies reported patients as having increased versus normal insulin levels for each metabolic disorder. The presence (+) or absence (-) of hyperinsulinemia was documented in these articles as follows: central obesity (4+ vs 0-), diabetes (5+ vs 0-), hypertension (9+ vs 1-), dyslipidemia (2+ vs 0-), renal failure (4+ vs 0-), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (5+ vs 0-), polycystic ovary syndrome (7+ vs 1-), sleep apnea (7+ vs 0-), certain cancers (4+ vs 1-), atherosclerosis (4+ vs 0-), and cardiovascular disease (8+ vs 0-). Four articles examined insulin levels in the metabolic syndrome as a whole (4+ vs 0-). These data document that disorders linked to the metabolic syndrome are associated with high levels of insulin, suggesting that these diseases share a common etiology that is expressed by high levels of insulin. This leads us to propose the concept of a ""hyperinsulinemic syndrome"" and question the safety of insulin as a chronic therapy for patients with T2DM.",10.1016/j.surg.2014.04.028,,,,1203
1408,Utility of routine versus selective upper gastrointestinal series to detect anastomotic leaks after laparoscopic gastric bypass.,"In up to 4% of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) procedures, anastomotic leaks occur. Early detection of gastrointestinal leakage is important for successful treatment. Consequently, many centers advocate routine postoperative upper gastrointestinal (UGI) series. The aim of this study was to determine the utility of this practice after LRYGB. Eight hundred four consecutive patients undergoing LRYGB from June 2000 to April 2010 were analyzed prospectively. The first 382 patients received routine UGI series between the third and fifth postoperative days (group A). Thereafter, the test was only performed when clinical findings (tachycardia, fever, and drainage content) were suspicious for a leak of the gastrointestinal anastomosis (group B; nâ€‰=â€‰422). Overall, nine of 804 (1.1%) patients suffered from leaks at the gastroenterostomy. In group A, four of 382 (1%) patients had a leak, but only two were detected by the routine UGI series. This corresponds to a sensitivity of 50%. In group B, the sensitivity was higher with 80%. Specificities were comparable with 97% and 91%, respectively. Routine UGI series cost only 1.6% of the overall costs of a non-complicated gastric bypass procedure. With this leak rate and sensitivity, US $86,800 would have to be spent on 200 routine UGI series to find one leak which is not justified. This study shows that routine UGI series have a low sensitivity for the detection of anastomotic leaks after LRYGB. In most cases, the diagnosis is initiated by clinical findings. Therefore, routine upper gastrointestinal series are of limited value for the diagnosis of a leak.",10.1007/s11695-010-0284-y,,,,1204
938,Weight loss induced by very low calorie diet is associated with a more beneficial systemic inflammatory profile than by Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Weight loss interventions such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and very low calorie diets (VLCD) lead to improvement of glucose metabolism in obese individuals with type-2 diabetes. Weight loss can also positively influence the unfavorable inflammatory profile associated with obesity. However, a direct comparison of the effect of VLCD and RYGB on systemic inflammation is lacking. Systemic inflammation was investigated in age- and BMI-matched morbidly obese T2DM women by determining the number and activation- or memory status of peripheral blood leukocytes by flow cytometry, in addition to measuring circulating levels of cytokines and CRP. Systemic inflammation was assessed one month before and three months after RYGB (n=15) or VLCD (n=12). An age matched group of lean women (n=12) was studied as control group. Three months after the intervention, CRP and leptin levels were reduced whereas adiponectin levels were increased both by RYGB and VLCD. TNF-Î± levels were increased by RYGB, but reduced by VLCD. IL-2 and IL-6 levels were reduced and IL-4 levels were increased by VLCD but not affected by RYGB. The number of activated peripheral cytotoxic T (CD8+CD25+) and B (CD19+CD38+) cells was significantly higher after RYGB than after VLCD. In conclusion, RYGB and VLCD have differential effects on the activation status of peripheral leukocytes and levels of cytokines in obese women with T2DM, despite comparable weight loss three months after the intervention. VLCD seems to have more favorable effects on the inflammatory profile as compared to RYGB.",10.1016/j.metabol.2016.07.013,,,,1205
1348,Linear stapler technique may be safer than circular in gastrojejunal anastomosis for laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a meta-analysis of comparative studies.,"The technique of choice for gastrojejunostomy (GJ) during laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) for morbid obesity is controversial. We performed a meta-analysis comparing linear versus circular stapler technique to evaluate this issue. A systematic literature search was performed. Primary outcomes were gastrojejunal leak and stricture. Secondary outcomes were operative time, length of hospital stay, post-operative bleeding, wound infection, marginal ulcers and estimated weight loss. Eight studies involving 1,321 patients were retrieved and included in the present study. A significantly decreased risk of GJ stricture was observed after using linear versus circular stapler (RR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.12-0.93; pâ€‰=â€‰0.04). Wound infection risk (RR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.22-0.67; pâ€‰=â€‰0.0008) and operative time (MD, -24.18; 95% CI, -35.31, -13.05; pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001) were significantly reduced by using linear stapling. No significant differences were observed in the other outcome end-points. The use of the linear stapler compared with circular stapler for GJ during LRYGB for morbid obesity may be associated with a reduced risk of anastomosis stricture and wound infection, as well as with a shorter operative time.",10.1007/s11695-011-0520-0,,,,1206
581,Intestinal sensing and handling of dietary lipids in gastric bypass-operated patients and matched controls.,"Altered meal-related gut hormone secretion seems important for weight loss and diabetes remission after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Elucidating the responsible meal components and receptors could aid discovery of new treatments of obesity and diabetes. Enteroendocrine cells respond to digestion products of dietary triacylglycerol, especially long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) and 2-oleoyl-glycerol (2-OG), but not medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs). We examined the impact of olive oil (20 mL) and its derivates, LCFAs and 2-OG, on enteroendocrine secretions [glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), cholecystokinin (CCK), peptide YY (PYY), and neurotensin (NT)] and on glucose, lipid, and bile acid metabolism in RYGB-operated and unoperated individuals. In an exploratory randomized crossover design, 10 RYGB-operated patients and 10 matched controls ingested 3 equimolar triacylglycerol formulations on separate days: olive oil (digested to 2-OGÂ +Â LCFAs), C8-dietary oil (2-OGÂ +Â MCFAs), and tricaprylin (MCFAs; negative control). Hormone responses were calculated as area under the curve (AUC). Independent of group status, olive oil had greater effects than C8-dietary oil on AUCs of plasma GLP-1 (+32%; 95% CI: 23%, 43%; PÂ <Â 0.01), CCK (+53%, PÂ <Â 0.01), and NT (+71%, PÂ <Â 0.01), whereas the effect on GIP differed between groups (+90% in controls, PÂ <Â 0.01; +24% in RYGB, PÂ =Â 0.10). Independent of group status, C8-dietary oil had greater effects than tricaprylin on AUCs of plasma CCK (+40%, PÂ <Â 0.01) and NT (+32%, PÂ <Â 0.01), but not GLP-1 (+5%; 95% CI: -2.9%, 13%; PÂ =Â 0.22), whereas the effect on GIP again differed between groups (+78% in controls, PÂ <Â 0.01; +39% in RYGB, PÂ =Â 0.01). Distal (GLP-1/PYY/NT), but not proximal (CCK/GIP), enteroendocrine responses were generally greater in RYGB patients than in controls. The combination of LCFAs plus 2-OG was substantially more effective than 2-OG plus MCFAs in stimulating enteroendocrine secretion in RYGB-operated and matched control individuals. Distal lipid-induced gut hormone release was greater after RYGB.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03223389.",10.1093/ajcn/nqz272,,,,1207
1395,Long-term prevention of mortality in morbid obesity through bariatric surgery. a systematic review and meta-analysis of trials performed with gastric banding and gastric bypass.,"Bariatric surgery has been reported to reduce long-term mortality in operated participants in comparison with nonoperated participants. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials published as full articles dealing with cardiovascular (CV) mortality, all-cause mortality (noncardiovascular), and global mortality (sum of CV and all-cause mortality). Pooled-fixed effects of estimates of the risk of mortality in participants undergoing surgery were calculated compared with controls. Of 44,022 participants from 8 trials (14,052 undergoing surgery and 29,970 controls), death occurred in 3317 participants (400 in surgery, 2917 in controls); when the kind of death was specified, 321 CV deaths (118 in surgery, 203 in controls), and 523 all-cause deaths (218 in surgery, 305 in controls) occurred. Compared with controls, surgery was associated with a reduced risk of global mortality (OR = 0.55, CI, 0.49-0.63), of CV mortality (OR = 0.58, CI, 0.46-0.73), and of all-cause mortality (OR = 0.70, CI, 0.59-0.84).Data of all-cause mortality were not heterogeneous; heterogeneity of data of CV mortality decreased when studies were grouped according to size (large vs small studies). The reduction of risk was smaller in large than in small studies (OR = 0.61 vs 0.21, 0.63 vs 0.16, 0.74 vs 0.35 for global, CV, and all-cause mortality, respectively). The effect of gastric banding and gastric by-pass (3797 vs 10,255 interventions) was similar for global and all-cause mortality (OR = 0.57 vs 0.55, and 0.66 vs 0.70, respectively), different for CV mortality (OR = 0.71 vs 0.48). At meta-regression analysis, a trend for a decrease of global mortality (Log OR) linked to increasing BMI appeared. This meta-analysis indicates that (1) bariatric surgery reduces long-term mortality; (2) risk reduction is smaller in large than in small studies; and (3) both gastric banding and gastric by-pass reduce mortality with a greater effect of the latter on CV mortality.",10.1097/SLA.0b013e31820d98cb,,,,1208
694,Effect of Roux-en-Y gastric surgery on ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics: an obvious effect?,"To evaluate pharmacokinetic parameters of ciprofloxacin in patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric surgery (RYGS). Controlled, single-dose, open-label study in patients undergoing RYGS. Healthy overweight/obese patients 18-60Â years old were included. The assessment was performed once in control patients and three times in case patients (before surgery and 1 and 6Â months after surgery). In each visit, the subjects received a single oral dose of ciprofloxacin 500Â mg. Venous blood samples were obtained at baseline and 0.5, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 8 and 14Â h after ciprofloxacin intake. Pre- and post-surgery variables were compared using paired ANOVA or the Wilcoxon tests and control vs cases using ANOVA or Mann Whitney. Given the post-surgery change in body weight, the parameters were corrected by dose (mg)/body weight (kg). The analysis was performed using SPSS. Ciprofloxacin Cmax was significantly reduced 1Â month after surgery (1840.9â€‰Â±â€‰485.2 vs 1589.6â€‰Â±â€‰321.8Â ng/ml; pâ€‰=â€‰0.032) but not 6Â months after. Cmax on the sixth month was lower than Cmax in control group (2160.4â€‰Â±â€‰408.6 vs 1589.6â€‰Â±â€‰321.8Â ng/ml; pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). After correcting by the dose (mg)/patient's body weight, both Cmax and AUClast showed significant decrease 1 and 6Â months after surgery: Cmax, 289.1â€‰Â±â€‰65.3 and 263.5â€‰Â±â€‰52.1 (ng/ml)/(dose (mg)/weight (kg)) respectively vs 429.3â€‰Â±â€‰127.6 (ng/ml)/(dose (mg)/weight (kg)) at baseline; AUC, 1340.6â€‰Â±â€‰243.0 and 1299.2â€‰Â±â€‰415.4 (h Ã— ng/ml)/(dose (mg)/weight (kg)) respectively vs 1896.7â€‰Â±â€‰396.8 (h Ã— ng/ml)/(dose (mg)/weight (kg)) at baseline. Cmax 1Â month post-surgery showed lower values than the control group (375.4â€‰Â±â€‰77.4 vs 263.5â€‰Â±â€‰52.1Â ng/ml; pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Ciprofloxacin absorption is impaired 1Â month and 6Â months after RYGS. The effect on Cmax and AUClast faded on the sixth month due to weight loss. It is no necessary to modify the doses of ciprofloxacin in these patients.",10.1007/s00228-018-02623-8,,,,1209
480,"After you Roux, what do you do? A systematic review of most successful advanced assisted ERCP techniques in patients with various altered upper gastrointestinal surgical anatomical reconstructions with particular focus on RYGB (last 10Â years).","Access to the Common Bile Duct in patients with surgically altered UGI anatomy such as RYGB is exceptionally challenging. Previously, these patients could only be treated by open surgery; however, multiple new advanced assisted ERCP techniques such as EDGE, LA-ERCP, and DEA-ERCP have now been developed and indeed successfully used to treat these patients. Despite growing experience, these techniques have yet to become part of our mainstream practice and many clinicians remain unfamiliar or even unaware of them; as a result, they are unfortunately often overlooked. We conducted this systematic review to try and shed more light on them and understand which of these techniques resulted in the best patient outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of PubMed database publications between December 2008 and December 2018. Keyword variants of ""EDGE, Enteroscopy-assisted & laparoscopy-assisted ERCP"" and ""altered surgical anatomy"" were combined to identify relevant papers for inclusion. We identified 34 studies, comprising a total of 1848 advanced assisted ERCPs in patients with altered UGI anatomy from 12 different countries. These papers were critically appraised, summarised, and presented in table format. EDGE and LA-ERCP were associated with both the highest overall combined CBD cannulation rates (99.3% for both vs 74.6% for DEA-ERCP) and ERCP interventional success (98.3% for EDGE vs 97.4% for LA-ERCP and 67.6% for DEA-ERCP). Advanced ERCP is associated with excellent success rates and a higher safety profile than surgery; however, patient selection and identification of the exact surgical anatomy are key.",10.1007/s12328-020-01201-9,,,,1210
984,Improvements in glycemic control after gastric bypass occur despite persistent adipose tissue inflammation.,"Type 2 diabetes commonly goes into remission following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). As the mechanisms remain incompletely understood, a reduction in adipose tissue inflammation may contribute to these metabolic improvements. Therefore, whether RYGB reduces adipose tissue inflammation compared with equivalent weight loss from an intensive lifestyle intervention was investigated. Sixteen people with obesity and type 2 diabetes were randomized to RYGB or lifestyle intervention. Fasting blood and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue were obtained before and after the loss of âˆ¼7% of baseline weight. Adipose tissue inflammation was assessed by whole-tissue gene expression and flow cytometry-based quantification of tissue leukocytes. At 7% weight loss, insulin and metformin use were reduced among the RYGB but not the Lifestyle cohort, while fasting glucose and insulin declined in both. Adipose tissue inflammation increased modestly after RYGB and to a similar extent following nonsurgical weight loss. In both groups, the number of neutrophils increased severalfold (P < 0.001), mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1Î² increased (P = 0.037), and mRNA expression of the anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing adipokine adiponectin decreased (P = 0.010). A reduction in adipose tissue inflammation is not one of the acute weight loss-independent mechanisms through which RYGB exerts its antidiabetes effects.",10.1002/oby.21524,,,,1211
1385,Vitamin status after gastric bypass and lifestyle intervention: a comparative prospective study.,"Bariatric surgery can lead to vitamin deficiencies. We aimed to assess the changes in blood vitamin concentrations in patients who were taking predefined supplements after gastric bypass surgery. A total of 29 patients underwent gastric bypass and 24 unmatched controls underwent lifestyle intervention in a prospective, nonrandomized trial. The patients in the surgical group received multivitamin, iron, calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin B(12) supplements. No supplements were prescribed to the lifestyle group. The median body mass index decreased from 46 to 32 kg/m(2) after surgery and from 40 to 39 kg/m(2) after lifestyle intervention. Of the 53 included patients, 50 completed the 1-year follow-up examination (94%). Compared with the lifestyle patients, the surgical patients had increased vitamin B(6), folic acid, vitamin B(12), and lipid-adjusted vitamin E (P <.02 for each) concentrations but decreased vitamin A concentrations (P <.01) during follow-up. No significant difference between the 2 groups was found for vitamin B(1), vitamin C, or 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Most surgical patients reported taking their supplements. Gastric bypass patients adhering to a set of dietary supplements had mostly stable or increased vitamin concentrations compared with both their baseline values and the changes in a nonsurgical control group.",10.1016/j.soard.2011.01.038,,,,1212
386,Effects of Manipulating Circulating Bile Acid Concentrations on Postprandial GLP-1 Secretion and Glucose Metabolism After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.,"Altered bile acid (BA) turnover has been suggested to be involved in the improved glucose regulation after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), possibly via stimulation of GLP-1 secretion. We investigated the role of exogenous as well as endogenous BAs for GLP-1 secretion after RYGB by administering chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and the BA sequestrant colesevelam (COL) both in the presence and the absence of a meal stimulus. Two single-blinded randomized cross-over studies were performed. In study 1, eight RYGB operated participants ingested 200Â ml water with 1) CDCA 1.25Â g or 2) CDCA 1.25Â g + colesevelam 3.75Â g on separate days. In study 2, twelve RYGB participants ingested on separate days a mixed meal with addition of 1) CDCA 1.25Â g, 2) COL 3.75Â g or 3) COL 3.75Â g Ã— 2, or 4) no additions. In study 1, oral intake of CDCA increased circulating BAs, GLP-1, C-peptide, glucagon, and neurotensin. Addition of colesevelam reduced all responses. In study 2, addition of CDCA enhanced meal-induced increases in plasma GLP-1, glucagon and FGF-19 and lowered plasma glucose and C-peptide concentrations, while adding colesevelam lowered circulating BAs but did not affect meal-induced changes in plasma glucose or measured gastrointestinal hormones. In RYGB-operated persons, exogenous CDCA enhanced meal-stimulated GLP-1 and glucagon secretion but not insulin secretion, while the BA sequestrant colesevelam decreased CDCA-stimulated GLP-1 secretion but did not affect meal-stimulated GLP-1, C-peptide or glucagon secretion, or glucose tolerance. These findings suggest a limited role for endogenous bile acids in the acute regulation of postprandial gut hormone secretion or glucose metabolism after RYGB.",10.3389/fendo.2021.681116,,,,1213
1278,Fast-track laparoscopic bariatric surgery: a systematic review.,"This study aimed to systematically evaluate the evidence-based literature on fast-track laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) to determine the feasibility and safety of fast-track laparoscopic bariatric surgery. A literature search of PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library using the MeSH terms ""bariatric surgery"", ""ambulatory surgical procedures"" and related terms as keywords was performed. The study included articles that reported on intended next-day discharge for LRYGB and same-day discharge for LAGB. Data were extracted on study design and size, patient demographics, patient-selection criteria, patient preparation, perioperative management, operative details, clinical outcomes, and follow-up. The review included 13 studies classified as level 3b or 4 evidence. There were seven studies that investigated LAGB, five studies investigated LRYGB and one study detailed outcomes from both LRYGB and LAGB. Next-day discharge rate ranged from 81 to 100Â % for LRYGB. Same-day discharge rate ranged from 76 to 98Â % for LAGB. In LRYGB and LAGB complication, re-admission and mortality rates (â‰¤10.5, â‰¤7.5, â‰¤0.1Â %, respectively) were comparable with the conventional perioperative care. From our results, the fast-track management of patients undergoing LRYGB and LAGB is feasible. With careful patient selection and preparation within high-volume centres, and application of care pathways including close outpatient follow-up, outcomes for fast-track bariatric procedures can compare favourably with those reported in the literature for standard management, but with decreased cost. However, further studies from independent researchers are required to determine the safety of a generalised adoption of this approach outside of dedicated bariatric units, and to formally demonstrate the cost-benefit of fast-track bariatric surgery.",10.1007/s13304-012-0195-7,,,,1214
668,Potential premalignant status of gastric portion excluded after Roux en-Y gastric bypass in obese women: A pilot study.,"We evaluated whether the excluded stomach (ES) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) can represent a premalignant environment. Twenty obese women were prospectively submitted to double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) with gastric juice and biopsy collection, before and 3 months after RYGB. We then evaluated morphological and molecular changes by combining endoscopic and histopathological analyses with an integrated untargeted metabolomics and transcriptomics multiplatform. Preoperatively, 16 women already presented with gastric histopathological alterations and an increased pH (â‰¥4.0). These gastric abnormalities worsened after RYGB. A 90-fold increase in the concentration of bile acids was found in ES fluid, which also contained other metabolites commonly found in the intestinal environment, urine, and faeces. In addition, 135 genes were differentially expressed in ES tissue. Combined analysis of metabolic and gene expression data suggested that RYGB promoted activation of biological processes involved in local inflammation, bacteria overgrowth, and cell proliferation sustained by genes involved in carcinogenesis. Accumulated fluid in the ES appears to behave as a potential premalignant environment due to worsening inflammation and changing gene expression patterns that are favorable to the development of cancer. Considering that ES may remain for the rest of the patient's life, long-term ES monitoring is therefore recommended for patients undergoing RYGB.",10.1038/s41598-019-42082-4,,,,1215
267,Prevalence of sarcopenia in women at stable weight phase after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Evaluating the prevalence of sarcopenia in women submitted to bariatric surgery - Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Design: Observational, cross-sectional study. Women (18-65 years old) who underwent bariatric surgery (BG) â‰¥ 2 years and reached stable weight â‰¥ 6 months, were investigated. Control group (CG) comprised non-operated matched women with obesity. Body composition was determined through dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Low lean mass (LLM) was defined as appendicular lean mass index (ALM kg/height m2) < 5.5 kg/m2. Physical strength was assessed through dynamometer and sit-to-stand test (SST), whereas performance was assessed through 4-m gait speed and Short Physical Performance Battery Tests (SPPB). Sarcopenia was diagnosed in the presence of LLM and low strength. One-hundred and twenty women (60 in each group, 50 Â± 9.7 years old) were investigated. All anthropometric and body composition parameters were lower in BG than in CG, whereas strength and performance were similar between groups. Women with reduced strength presented high total fat mass and low physical activity level (p < 0.005). LLM was observed in 35% of BG and in 18.3% of CG (p = 0.04), whereas sarcopenia was diagnosed in 28.3% of BG and in 16.6% of CG (p = 0.12). Sarcopenic women in BG had better performance both in SST (p = 0.001) and SPPB (p = 0.004). Total lean mass (OR:1.41, 95% CI [1.18; 1.69], p < 0.001) and obesity (OR: 38.2 [2.27; 644.12], p < 0.001) were associated with sarcopenia in the multivariate analysis. Despite great weight loss, sarcopenia prevalence did not increase in BG and its presence was influenced by total lean mass and obesity.",10.20945/2359-3997000000494,,,,1216
279,Linear Stapler versus Circular Stapler for Patients Undergoing Anastomosis for Laparoscopic Gastric Surgery: A Meta-Analysis.,"Anastomotic devices, including linear staplers (LSs) and circular staplers (CSs), have been widely used after laparoscopic gastric surgery. However, it is controversial whether linear stapling is superior to circular stapling for anastomosis. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to compare the aspects of postoperative complications, particularly anastomotic stricture and anastomotic leakage, on the use of the two techniques to assist clinical decision-making. We conducted a systematic search using Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library to evaluate studies that compared LSs and CSs after laparoscopic gastric surgery. Pooled analysis suggested that patients who received LSs had fewer postoperative complications (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.019), and anastomotic complications (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), stricture (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001), and bleeding (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.005). The subgroup analyses showed that LSs caused fewer anastomotic complications (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), anastomotic strictures (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and postoperative hemorrhage (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.007) in patients with gastric cancer than CS. In addition, LSs caused fewer incidences of overall morbidity (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.042), anastomotic strictures (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.023), postoperative hemorrhage (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), wound infection (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and shorter length of hospital stay (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.048) in patients with obesity. Furthermore, the subgroup analyses showed that the use of LS resulted in lower overall morbidity (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.042), anastomotic stricture (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.023), wound infection (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), length of hospital stay (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.048), and postoperative hemorrhage (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) when applied in gastrojejunostomy, while LSs resulted in fewer anastomotic complications (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), anastomotic stricture (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.016) than CS when applied in esophagojejunostomy. Compared with CSs, LSs yielded a lower incidence of overall morbidity, anastomotic complications, anastomotic stricture, bleeding, and wound infection, indicating that linear stapling is safer and more efficient than circular stapling when performing anastomosis after laparoscopic gastric surgery.",10.1080/08941939.2022.2058126,,,,1217
1449,A systematic review of methods to palliate malignant gastric outlet obstruction.,"The traditional approach to palliating patients with malignant gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) has been open gastrojejunostomy (OGJ). More recently endoscopic stenting (ES) and laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy (LGJ) have been introduced as alternatives, and some studies have suggested improved outcomes with ES. The aim of this review is to compare ES with OGJ and LGJ in terms of clinical outcome. A systematic literature search and review was performed for the period January 1990 to May 2008. Original comparative studies were included where ES was compared with either LGJ or OGJ or both, for the palliation of malignant GOO. Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria (10 retrospective cohort studies, two randomised controlled trials and one prospective study). Compared with OGJ, ES resulted in an increased likelihood of tolerating an oral intake [odds ratio (OR) 2.6, p = 0.02], a shorter time to tolerating an oral intake (mean difference 6.9 days, p < 0.001) and a shorter post-procedural hospital stay (mean difference 11.8 days, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between 30-day mortality, complication rates or survival. There were an inadequate number of cases to quantitatively compare ES with LGJ. This review demonstrates improved clinical outcomes with ES over OGJ for patients with malignant GOO. However, there is insufficient data to adequately compare ES with LGJ, which is the current standard for operative management. As these conclusions are based on observational studies only, future large well-designed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) would be required to ensure the estimates of the relative efficacy of these interventions are valid.",10.1007/s00464-009-0577-1,,,,1218
1152,Effect of a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on the pharmacokinetics of oral morphine using a population approach.,"Obesity and opioid use for chronic pain in obese individuals are both important public health concerns. The pharmacokinetics of oral morphine after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) are unknown. Therefore, we aimed to study the pharmacokinetics of oral morphine in morbidly obese patients before and after RYGB surgery, to identify the effects of RYGB and the subsequent reversal of morbid obesity on the pharmacokinetic parameters of morphine. The pharmacokinetics of oral morphine (30Â mg) were studied in 30 obese patients before (VisitÂ 1) and then 7-15Â days (VisitÂ 2) and 6Â months (VisitÂ 3) after RYGB. A population pharmacokinetic model was used to describe the time course of the plasma morphine concentration, to study the effect of RYGB on morphine pharmacokinetics and to estimate inter-patient variability. The oral morphine time to maximum plasma concentration (t max) was twofold lower and maximum plasma concentration (C max) was 1.7 times higher at VisitÂ 2, and t max was 7.5 times lower and C max 3.3 times higher at VisitÂ 3 than at VisitÂ 1. The mean oral morphine area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increased significantly (1.55-fold) between VisitsÂ 1 and 3. Changes in body mass index (BMI) after RYGB were clearly associated with decreased apparent oral morphine clearance and apparent central and peripheral morphine volumes of distribution. None of the other anthropometric parameters explained the inter-subject variability in morphine exposure better than BMI. RYGB and the BMI reduction that followed it dramatically increased the rate of morphine absorption and slightly increased morphine exposure. The dose of immediate-release forms of morphine may be divided in obese patients after RYGB to prevent adverse events due to early and high morphine plasma peaks.",10.1007/s40262-014-0163-0,,,,1219
306,Can responsive deep brain stimulation be a cost-effective treatment for severe obesity?,"A first-in-human responsive deep brain stimulation (rDBS) trial (NCT03868670) for obesity is under way, which is based on promising preclinical evidence. Given the upfront costs of rDBS, it is prudent to examine the success threshold for cost-effectiveness compared with laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). Efficacy and safety data on LRYGB and safety data on rDBS were collected for established indications through a literature search. The success threshold was defined as minimum BMI reduction. Treatment costs were calculated via Medicare national reimbursement data. LRYGB had a mean BMI reduction of 13.75 kg/m2 . Based on adverse events, LRYGB was a less-preferred health state (overall adverse event utility of 0.96 [0.02]) than rDBS (0.98 [0.01]), but LRYGB ($14,366 [$6,410]) had a significantly lower treatment cost than rDBS ($29,951 [$4,490]; p < 0.0001). Therefore, for rDBS to be cost-effective compared with LRYGB, the multiple models yielded a success threshold range of 13.7 to 15.2 kg/m2 . This study established a preliminary efficacy success threshold for rDBS to be cost-effective for severe obesity, and results from randomized controlled trials are needed. This analysis allows for interpretation of the economic impact of advancing rDBS for obesity in light of ongoing trial results and suggests an attainable threshold is needed for cost-effectiveness.",10.1002/oby.23324,,,,1220
1022,Once versus twice daily injection of enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis in bariatric surgery: effects on antifactor Xa activity and procoagulant microparticles. A randomized controlled study.,"The optimal scheme of thromboprophylaxis in bariatric surgery remains uncertain, because clinical practice is different between countries and randomized trials are lacking. The primary objective of this randomized multicenter study was to determine the optimal regimen of enoxaparin providing an antifactor Xa peak activity between .3 and .5 IU/mL at equilibrium and to evaluate the course of procoagulant microparticles (MPs). University hospital. A total of 164 patients scheduled for gastric bypass were allocated to 3 groups (A, B, and C) of enoxaparin treatment (4000, 6000, or 2Ã—4000 IU, respectively). Antifactor Xa activity was measured before and 4 hours after each injection from D0 to D2. Doppler screening of the lower limbs was performed at D1, D9, and D30. Bleeding (BE) and thrombotic events (TE) were recorded during the first postoperative month. Total MPs were measured at D0, D9, and D30. MPs of leucocyte, platelet, and granulocyte origin were assessed in one third of the patients from each group. The 3 groups were compared by ANOVA. A total of 135 patients were analyzed. The equilibrium of antifactor Xa peak levels was obtained 52 hours after the presurgery injection and 12.8%, 56.4%, and 27.3% of the patients reached the target in groups A, B, and C, respectively (P<.001). No TE was detected. BE occurred in 1, 2, and 6 patients in groups A, B, and C, respectively). Total MPs remained unchanged over time. While no significant variation was observed in the other groups, platelet GP1 b(+)-MPs increased (P = .01) at D9 in group C, suggesting an incomplete control of anticoagulation leading to cell activation and procoagulant MP release that was confirmed by the higher MP levels measured at D30 (P = .04). CD66(+)-MPs were also highly elevated at J9 and D30 in group C indicating a granulocyte contribution. This study shows that a single dose of enoxaparin 6000 IU/d allowed most of the patients to reach the target range of antifactor Xa activity without increasing the bleeding risk, with the most likely efficient reduction of procoagulant MPs.

1517,Stent versus gastrojejunostomy for the palliation of gastric outlet obstruction: a systematic review.,"Gastrojejunostomy (GJJ) is the most commonly used palliative treatment modality for malignant gastric outlet obstruction. Recently, stent placement has been introduced as an alternative treatment. We reviewed the available literature on stent placement and GJJ for gastric outlet obstruction, with regard to medical effects and costs. A systematic review of the literature was performed by searching PubMed for the period January 1996 and January 2006. A total of 44 publications on GJJ and stents was identified and reported results on medical effects and costs were pooled and evaluated. Results from randomized and comparative studies were used for calculating odds ratios (OR) to compare differences between the two treatment modalities. In 2 randomized trials, stent placement was compared with GJJ (with 27 and 18 patients in each trial). In 6 comparative studies, stent placement was compared with GJJ. Thirty-six series evaluated either stent placement or GJJ. A total of 1046 patients received a duodenal stent and 297 patients underwent GJJ. No differences between stent placement and gastrojejunostomy were found in technical success (96% vs. 100%), early and late major complications 7% vs. 6% and 18% vs. 17%, respectively) and persisting symptoms (8% vs. 9%). Initial clinical success was higher after stent placement (89% vs. 72%). Minor complications were less frequently seen after stent placement in the patient series (9% vs. 33%), however the pooled analysis showed no differences (OR: 0.75, p = 0.8). Recurrent obstructive symptoms were more common after stent placement (18% vs. 1%). Hospital stay was prolonged after GJJ compared to stent placement (13 days vs. 7 days). The mean survival was 105 days after stent placement and 164 days after GJJ. These results suggest that stent placement may be associated with more favorable results in patients with a relatively short life expectancy, while GJJ is preferable in patients with a more prolonged prognosis. The paucity of evidence from large randomized trials may however have influenced the results and therefore a trial of sufficient size is needed to determine which palliative treatment modality is optimal in (sub)groups of patients with malignant gastric outlet obstruction.",10.1186/1471-230X-7-18,,,,1224
98,A specific gut microbiota signature is associated with an enhanced GLP-1 and GLP-2 secretion and improved metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes after metabolic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"To determine changes in incretins, systemic inflammation, intestinal permeability and microbiome modifications 12 months after metabolic RYGB (mRYGB) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and their relationship with metabolic improvement. Prospective single-center non-randomized controlled study, including patients with class II-III obesity and T2D undergoing mRYGB. At baseline and one year after surgery we performed body composition measurements, biochemical analysis, a meal tolerance test (MTT) and lipid test (LT) with determination of the area under the curve (AUC) for insulin, C-peptide, GLP-1, GLP-2, and fasting determinations of succinate, zonulin, IL-6 and study of gut microbiota. Thirteen patients aged 52.6 Â± 6.5 years, BMI 39.3 Â± 1.4 kg/m2, HbA1c 7.62 Â± 1.5% were evaluated. After mRYGB, zonulin decreased and an increase in AUC after MTT was observed for GLP-1 (pre 9371 Â± 5973 vs post 15788 Â± 8021 pM, P<0.05), GLP-2 (pre 732 Â± 182 vs post 1190 Â± 447 ng/ml, P<0.001) and C- peptide, as well as after LT. Species belonging to Streptococaceae, Akkermansiacea, Rickenellaceae, Sutterellaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Oscillospiraceae, Veillonellaceae, Enterobacterales_uc, and Fusobacteriaceae families increased after intervention and correlated positively with AUC of GLP-1 and GLP-2, and negatively with glucose, HbA1c, triglycerides and adiposity markers. Clostridium perfringens and Roseburia sp. 40_7 behaved similarly. In contrast, some species belonging to Lachnospiraceae, Erysipelotricaceae, and Rumnicocaceae families decreased and showed opposite correlations. Higher initial C-peptide was the only predictor for T2D remission, which was achieved in 69% of patients. Patients with obesity and T2D submitted to mRYGB show an enhanced incretin response, a reduced gut permeability and a metabolic improvement, associated with a specific microbiota signature.",10.3389/fendo.2023.1181744,,,,1225
504,Cholecystectomy - a potential selection bias in studies assessing theÂ metabolic effects of bariatric surgeries.,"Bile acids (BAs) are key mediators of the glycemic control after bariatric surgeries. Cholecystectomy modifies the kinetics ofÂ BAs, andÂ whether this procedure influences the BAs pool and its metabolicÂ response to bariatric surgeriesÂ is not known. We usedÂ targeted and untargeted metabolomics to assess whether cholecystectomy influenced plasma and fecal BAs fluctuations and theÂ systemic metabolomic profile after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Women with obesity andÂ type 2 diabetes were included. Sample collections and clinical evaluations were performed before and 3 months after RYGB. RYGB influenced 9 fecal and 3 plasma BAs in patients with cholecystectomy (pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.05). Comparisons between patients with and without cholecystectomy revealed different concentrations of 4 fecal and 5 plasma BAs (pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.05). Cholecystectomy impacted theÂ global metabolomics responses to RYGB, and patients whoÂ underwent the gallbladder removalÂ also lacked some significant improvements in clinical markers, primarily the lipid profile. By affecting the BAs concentrations, cholecystectomy seems to alter the systemic metabolic response to RYGB. Therefore, cholecystectomy may act as a bias in assessmentsÂ of theÂ metabolic effects of bariatric surgeries and their relationships with clinical outcomes.",10.1038/s41598-020-66688-1,,,,1226
1294,Effects of gastric bypass surgery on female reproductive function.,"Reproductive function may improve after bariatric surgery, although the mechanisms and time-related changes are unclear. The objective of the study was to determine whether ovulation frequency/quality as well as associated reproductive parameters improve after Roux en Y gastric bypass surgery. This was a prospective cohort study that enrolled female subjects from 2005 to 2008 with study visits at baseline and then 1, 3, 6, 12, and up to 24 months after surgery. The study was conducted at an academic health center. Twenty-nine obese, reproductive-aged women not using confounding medications participated in the study. The primary outcome was integrated levels of urinary progestin (pregnanediol 3-glururonide) from daily urinary collections at 12 months postoperatively. Secondary outcomes were changes in vaginal bleeding, other biometric, hormonal, ultrasound, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry measures, and Female Sexual Function Index. Ninety percent of patients with morbid obesity had ovulatory cycles at baseline, and the ovulatory frequency and luteal phase quality (based on integrated pregnanediol 3-glururonide levels) were not modified by bariatric surgery. The follicular phase was shorter postoperatively [6.5 d shorter at 3 months and 7.9-8.9 d shorter at 6-24 months (P < 0.01)]. Biochemical hyperandrogenism improved, largely due to an immediate postoperative increase in serum SHBG levels (P < 0.01), with no change in clinical hyperandrogenism (sebum production, acne, hirsutism). Bone density was preserved, contrasting with a significant loss of lean muscle mass and fat (P < 0.001), reflecting preferential abdominal fat loss (P < 0.001). Female sexual function improved 28% (P = 0.02) by 12 months. Ovulation persists despite morbid obesity and the changes from bypass surgery. Reproductive function after surgery is characterized by a shortened follicular phase and improved female sexual function.",10.1210/jc.2012-2205,,,,1227
1076,Decreased Escitalopram Concentrations Post-Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery.,"There is a high coincidence between obesity and psychiatric disorders including depression. Depressive disorders are commonly treated with antidepressants, including the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Lexapro (escitalopram). Although candidates for elective Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery may be treated with escitalopram, drug dosing strategies are typically not adjusted postoperatively. Therefore, studies are needed to better characterize escitalopram drug concentrations in a postsurgical setting. Turbulent flow-liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric methods were used to quantify escitalopram concentrations in serum in study participants approved for RYGB. Blood was collected from study subjects 2 weeks before surgery, and 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively, to assess the impact of RYGB on systemic drug concentrations. Twelve samples from 4 study participants were collected and analyzed for serum escitalopram concentrations. Two weeks post-RYGB, although there were minimal changes in each participant's body mass index (<5%), drug concentrations were 33% (4%-71%) decreased as compared with presurgical serum concentrations. There were further decreases in drug concentrations 6 weeks postsurgery. All clinical laboratory values were within normal reference intervals. RYGB significantly alters the gastrointestinal tract and impacts escitalopram drug concentrations, even shortly after surgery.",10.1097/FTD.0000000000000146,,,,1228
303,The short-term outcome of distal mesogastric fixation after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: a randomized controlled trial.,"The proposed etiology of leakage after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy may be the axial rotation of the stomach owing to the loss of abdominal ligament fixation along the greater curvature of the stomach. The mechanism of increased intra-gastric pressure due to axial gastric rotation may place a great deal of stress on the staple lines, leading to an increased incidence of leakage. Other complications may occur, including vomiting, food intolerance or persistent reflux. This study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT04834323). This study included patients who were admitted to our center to undergo laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Cases were collected in the period from December 2019 to December 2020. The study population included 83 patients, who were divided into the following two groups: Group 1 included 42 patients who received distal mesogastric fixation after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy; Group 2 included 41 patients who received laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy alone without distal mesogastric fixation. No leakage or axial rotation occurs after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with distal fixation, while in patients without distal fixation, leakage and axial rotation occurred with no statistically significant differences between the two groups. Leakage and axial rotation occurred two times more frequently among patients who received laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy without distal fixations. Distal mesogastric fixation after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy decreased the axial gastric rotation and subsequently decreased gastric leakage.",10.1007/s00595-022-02459-x,,,,1229
441,Vitamin E status among bariatric surgery patients: a systematic review.,"Vitamin E, a fat-soluble vitamin with antioxidant properties, is thought to modulate enzymes involved in signal transduction, affect gene expression, and have immunomodulatory capabilities. Severe vitamin E deficiency is associated with neuronal disorders, impaired immune response, hemolytic anemia, and oxidative-based disorders. Patients who undergo bariatric surgery (BS), especially malabsorptive procedures, are at greater risk of developing fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. Current data on vitamin E statuses among BS patients are limited. Therefore, this systematic review has summarized the scientific literature on vitamin E and examined its status among patients following different types of BS. Searches of the MEDLINE and Embase databases were performed, followed by hand-searching of reference lists from all relevant papers. Of the 671 initially identified articles, 24 met the inclusion criteria: 1 study on adjustable gastric banding patients (n = 21), 4 studies on sleeve gastrectomy patients (n = 173), 12 studies on Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients (n = 689) and 12 studies on biliopancreatic diversion with or without duodenal switch (n = 799) or single anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy patients (n = 163). Results suggest that patients who undergo malabsorptive procedures are at higher risk of developing vitamin E deficiency, although clinical manifestations of vitamin E deficits following BS are rarely documented. The optimal dose of vitamin E supplementation required for prevention of deficiency or for treatment following BS has yet to be established. Future observational and intervention studies are needed to bridge the gaps in existing knowledge.",10.1016/j.soard.2020.10.029,,,,1230
846,Efficacy and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous exendin (9-39) in patients with post-bariatric hypoglycaemia.,"To evaluate the efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and tolerability of subcutaneous (s.c.). exendin 9-39 (Ex-9) injection in patients with post-bariatric hypoglycaemia (PBH). Nine women who had recurrent symptomatic hypoglycaemia after undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were enrolled in this 2-part, single-blind, single-ascending-dose study. In Part 1, a single participant underwent equimolar low-dose intravenous (i.v.) vs s.c. Ex-9 administration; in Part 2, 8 participants were administered single ascending doses of s.c. Ex-9 during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Glycaemic, hormonal, PK and symptomatic responses were compared with those obtained during the baseline OGTT. Although an exposure-response relationship was observed, all doses effectively prevented hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia and improved associated symptoms. On average, the postprandial glucose nadir was increased by 66%, peak insulin was reduced by 57%, and neuroglycopenic symptoms were reduced by 80%. All doses were well tolerated with no treatment-emergent adverse events observed. Injection s.c. of Ex-9 appears to represent a safe, effective and targeted therapeutic approach for treatment of PBH. Further investigation involving multiple doses with chronic dosing is warranted.",10.1111/dom.13078,,,,1231
583,Effectiveness of different recruitment strategies in an RCT of a surgical device: experience from the Endobarrier trial.,"Recruiting participants into clinical trials is notoriously difficult and poses the greatest challenge when planning any investigative study. Poor recruitment may not only have financial ramifications owing to increased time and resources being spent but could adversely influence the clinical impact of a study if it becomes underpowered. Herein, we present our own experience of recruiting into a nationally funded, multicentre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the Endobarrier versus standard medical therapy in obese patients with type 2diabetes. Despite these both being highly prevalent conditions, there were considerable barriers to the effectiveness of different recruitment strategies across each study site. Although recruitment from primary care proved extremely successful at one study site, this largely failed at another site prompting the implementation of multimodal recruitment strategies including a successful media campaign to ensure sufficient participants were enrolled and the study was adequately powered. From this experience, we propose where appropriate the early engagement and investment in media campaigns to enhance recruitment into clinical trials.

107,Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery in Patients with Situs Inversus: a Systematic Review.,"Laparoscopic surgery in patients with obesity with situs inversus (SI) may pose interesting challenges to diagnosing and managing due to the mirror image anatomy. Since in SI patient's organs are displaced, the surgery requires high levels of precision and hand-eye coordination. SI and bariatric surgery may pose challenges for the surgical team. A total of 46 patients were reported in this systematic review. The mean age of cases was ~39 years (range 19-59), and the mean BMI was 45.9 kg/m2 (range 35-76). Of the included 46 patients, 39 had SIT. In the majority of the included patients, either a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) (in 15 patients (35%)) or a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) (in 21 patients (45.6%)) was performed.

652,Relative Energy Expenditure Decreases during the First Year after Bariatric Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The effect of bariatric surgery on resting energy expenditure (REE) remains unclear, particularly in terms of the REE/fat-free mass (FFM) ratio. We performed a systematic review with a meta-analysis on Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) studies to investigate the effect of bariatric surgery on the REE/FFM ratio 6 and 12Â months postoperatively. Five of the 13 records of 6-month data (nâ€‰=â€‰406) showed a reduction in the REE/FFM ratio without significant summary effects. As regards 12-month data (10 records, nâ€‰=â€‰713), there was a significant relative REE mean reduction of 1.95Â kcal/kg in FFM (CI: -2.82 to -1.09; I2Â =â€‰28%; pâ€‰<â€‰0.00001). These findings suggest that bariatric surgery, specifically RYGB, leads to a decrease in the REE/FFM ratio during the first postoperative year, which may compromise long-term treatment outcomes.",10.1007/s11695-019-03934-0,,,,1234
1476,Gastric bypass and cardiac autonomic activity: influence of gender and age.,"Obesity is associated with increased sympathetic activity and higher mortality. Treatment of this condition is often frustrating. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the most effective technique nowadays for treatment of obesity. The aim of the present study is to assess the effects of this surgery on the cardiac autonomic activity, including the influence of gender and age, through heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. The study group consisted of 71 obese patients undergoing gastric bypass. Time domain measures of HRV, obtained from 24-h Holter recordings, were evaluated before and 6 months after surgery, and the results were compared. Percentage of interval differences of successive normal sinus beats greater than 50 ms (pNN50) and square root of the mean squared differences of successive normal sinus beat intervals (rMSSD) was used to estimate the short-term components of HRV, related to the parasympathetic activity. Standard deviation of intervals between all normal sinus beats (SDNN) was related to overall HRV. SDNN, pNN50, and rMSSD showed significant increase 6 months after surgery (p<0.001, p=0.001 and p=0.002, respectively). Men presented a greater increase of SDNN than women (p=0.006) during the follow-up. There was a difference in rMSSD evolution for age groups (p=0.002). Only younger patients presented significant increase of rMSSD. Overall HRV increased 6 months after surgery; this increase was more evident in men. Cardiac parasympathetic activity increased also, but in younger patients only.",10.1007/s11695-008-9665-x,,,,1235
982,Partial ileal bypass affords protection from onset of type 2 diabetes.,"Partial ileal bypass (PIB) in the National Institutes of Health-sponsored Program on the Surgical Control of the Hyperlipidemias (POSCH) randomized controlled trial was found to reduce plasma cholesterol, in particular low density lipoprotein cholesterol, with concomitant retardation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and increased life expectancy. Glucagon-like peptide-1, related to amelioration of type 2 diabetes, is increased over 5-fold after PIB. We hypothesized that PIB, in addition to its action on cholesterol metabolism, may also prevent type 2 diabetes. We surveyed by telephone inquiry of former POSCH patients the 30+year posttrial incidence of type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, the presence of which was a trial exclusion criteria. We were able to contact 17.4% (n = 838) of the original POSCH population. Of 66 control responders, 17 contracted type 2 diabetes (25.8%); of 80 PIB responders, 8 contracted type 2 diabetes (10%). The difference between groups was significant (P = .015 by Fisher exact test) with an odds ratio of .320 for the PIB group and an over 2-fold (2.6) increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in the controls. Including borderline type 2 diabetes (prediabetic) patients, these values were 22 of 66 controls (33.3%) and 10 of 80 PIB patients (12.5%), with an odds ratio of .286 and a P<.004, and again an over 2-fold (2.7) increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in the control patients. PIB appears to afford partial protection from the onset of type 2 diabetes for over 30 years.",10.1016/j.soard.2016.01.025,,,,1236
1226,Exaggerated release and preserved insulinotropic action of glucagon-like peptide-1 underlie insulin hypersecretion in glucose-tolerant individuals after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) improves glycaemic control in part by increasing postprandial insulin secretion through exaggerated glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 release. However, it is unknown whether islet cell responsiveness to i.v. glucose, non-glucose (arginine) and incretin hormones, including GLP-1, is altered. Eleven severely obese glucose-tolerant individuals underwent three hyperglycaemic clamps with arginine bolus and co-infusion of either GLP-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) or saline before, and at 1 week and 3 months after RYGB. In addition, an OGTT was performed before and 3 months after surgery. After RYGB, insulin sensitivity improved at 1 week and 3 months, while insulin stimulation and glucagon suppression in response to the clamp with saline co-infusion were largely unaltered. The influence of i.v. GLP-1 and GIP on insulin and glucagon secretion was also unchanged postoperatively. In response to the postoperative OGTT at 3 months, insulin and GLP-1, but not GIP, secretion increased. Furthermore, the glucose profile during the OGTT was altered, with a substantial reduction in 2 h plasma glucose and a paradoxical hypersecretion of glucagon. After RYGB, insulin hypersecretion is linked to the oral, but not the i.v., route of administration and is associated with exaggerated release and preserved insulinotropic action of GLP-1, while both the secretion and action of GIP are unchanged. The results highlight the importance of increased GLP-1 secretion for improving postoperative glucose metabolism. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01559779.",10.1007/s00125-013-3055-1,,,,1237
1295,Randomized clinical trial on the influence of anaesthesia protocol on intestinal motility during laparoscopic surgery requiring small bowel anastomosis.,"Hyperperistalsis of the small bowel during laparoscopic surgery may cause mucosal prolapse and reduce exposure, making laparoscopic suturing or stapling more demanding for the surgeon. Although it is commonly accepted that both opioids and volatile anaesthetics induce intestinal paralysis, intestinal hyperactivity during anaesthesia is not uncommon. This randomized trial investigated the effect of different volatile anaesthetics on intestinal motility and the impact on surgeon satisfaction. Patients scheduled for laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery were randomized to receive sevoflurane or desflurane in a balanced anaesthetic regimen. After surgical exposure peristaltic waves were counted over 1 min in a segment of the jejunum. Following evaluation of intestinal motility, N-butylhyoscine, an antimuscarinic anticholinergic agent that relaxes bowel smooth muscle cells, could be administered if the surgeon judged the intestinal motility as disturbing. The endpoints were number of peristaltic waves and incidence of N-butylhyoscine administration, a surrogate for surgeon satisfaction. Twenty-two patients were randomized to each group. The groups were similar in age, sex and body mass index. There was a statistically significant difference in intestinal motility between the desflurane and sevoflurane groups: median (range) 7 (0-12) versus 1 (0-10) waves counted over 1 min respectively (P < 0Â·001). A higher proportion of patients in the desflurane group received N-butylhyoscine (10 of 22 versus 1 of 22 in the sevoflurane group; P = 0Â·004). Desflurane increased intestinal motility and decreased surgeon satisfaction compared with sevoflurane during laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery. A sevoflurane-based anaesthetic protocol can help to avoid disturbing hyperperistalsis. B39620097060 (http://www.clinicaltrials.be).",10.1002/bjs.8883,,,,1238
839,Comparison of Bioavailability of Single-Dose Extended-Release Venlafaxine Capsules in Obese Patients Before and After Gastric Bypass Surgery.,"The extended-release (ER) form of venlafaxine is preferred because of improved patient adherence, but the immediate-release (IR) form is frequently used after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery because of concerns for malabsorption. The objective of this study was to determine whether a statistically significant and predictable change in the bioavailability of venlafaxine ER capsules occurs after RYGB. Prospective nonblinded single-dose pharmacokinetic study. Clinical research unit at a large tertiary care medical practice. Ten adult pre-bariatric surgery patients who met the criteria for noncomplicated RYGB were enrolled and served as their own controls. Patients were administered one venlafaxine ER 75-mg capsule at two visits-the first visit at least 1Â week before undergoing RYGB and the second visit 3-4Â months after RYGB. Blood samples were collected at predetermined intervals over 48Â hours after each dose, and the pharmacokinetics of venlafaxine were measured. Plasma levels of venlafaxine and its primary metabolite, O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV), were compared at baseline and 3-4Â months after RYGB. The areas under the serum concentration-time curves from 0-24Â hours (AUC0-24 ) for venlafaxine (meanÂ Â±Â SD 734Â Â±Â 602 vs 630Â Â±Â 553Â ngÂ·hr/ml, p=0.22) and ODV (meanÂ Â±Â SD 894Â Â±Â 899 vs 1083 Â±Â 972Â ngÂ·hr/ml, p=0.07) were similar before and after RYGB. Using a bioequivalence approach, differences in pre-RYGB and post-RYGB values of AUC0-24 , peak serum concentration, and time to peak serum concentration were not statistically significant for either venlafaxine or ODV. This study suggests that RYGB does not significantly alter the amount of venlafaxine or its active metabolite, ODV, absorbed from a venlafaxine ER capsule or the time over which it is absorbed.",10.1002/phar.2022,,,,1239
973,Gastric Bypass Reduces Symptoms and Hormonal Responses in Hypoglycemia.,"Gastric bypass (GBP) surgery, one of the most common bariatric procedures, induces weight loss and metabolic effects. The mechanisms are not fully understood, but reduced food intake and effects on gastrointestinal hormones are thought to contribute. We recently observed that GBP patients have lowered glucose levels and frequent asymptomatic hypoglycemic episodes. Here, we subjected patients before and after undergoing GBP surgery to hypoglycemia and examined symptoms and hormonal and autonomic nerve responses. Twelve obese patients without diabetes (8 women, mean age 43.1 years [SD 10.8] and BMI 40.6 kg/m(2) [SD 3.1]) were examined before and 23 weeks (range 19-25) after GBP surgery with hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp (stepwise to plasma glucose 2.7 mmol/L). The mean change in Edinburgh Hypoglycemia Score during clamp was attenuated from 10.7 (6.4) before surgery to 5.2 (4.9) after surgery. There were also marked postsurgery reductions in levels of glucagon, cortisol, and catecholamine and the sympathetic nerve responses to hypoglycemia. In addition, growth hormone displayed a delayed response but to a higher peak level. Levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide rose during hypoglycemia but rose less postsurgery compared with presurgery. Thus, GBP surgery causes a resetting of glucose homeostasis, which reduces symptoms and neurohormonal responses to hypoglycemia. Further studies should address the underlying mechanisms as well as their impact on the overall metabolic effects of GBP surgery.",10.2337/db16-0341,,,,1240
718,Postprandial hypoglycaemia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in individuals with type 2 diabetes.,"Postprandial hypoglycaemia (PPHG) is a complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery in normoglycaemic individuals. In type 2 diabetes, RYGB improves glucose metabolism, but whether this improvement is related to the later development of PPHG is not known. We investigated the presence and mechanisms of PPHG in individuals with type 2 diabetes undergoing RYGB. A total of 35 obese individuals with type 2 diabetes underwent an OGTT before and 24Â months after surgery. PPHG was defined as a plasma glucose level of â‰¤3.3Â mmol/l when not taking glucose-lowering agents. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by oral glucose insulin sensitivity index and beta-cell function by mathematical modelling of the plasma glucose, insulin and C-peptide concentrations. After surgery, PPHG occurred in 11 of 35 individuals who underwent RYGB. Before surgery, BMI was lower, glycaemic control less good and time of glucose peak earlier in the PPHG vs No PPHG group, and the duration of diabetes was shorter with PPHG (all pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.05). In addition, insulin sensitivity was greater in the PPHG than No PPHG group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.03). After surgery, BMI and fasting glucose and insulin levels decreased similarly in the two groups; insulin secretion during the first hour of the OGTT increased more in the PPHG than No PPHG group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.04). Beta-cell glucose sensitivity increased more in individuals with PPHG than those without (pâ€‰=â€‰0.002). Over the same time interval, the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) response was lower in individuals with PPHG before surgery (pâ€‰=â€‰0.05), and increased more after surgery. At 2Â h after glucose ingestion in the OGTT, postsurgery plasma glucagon level was significantly lower in the PPHG than No PPHG group. In morbidly obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, spontaneous PPHG may occur after bariatric surgery independently of a remission of diabetes. Before surgery, individuals had a shorter duration and were more insulin sensitive. Two years after surgery, these individuals developed greater beta-cell glucose sensitivity, and showed greater insulin and GLP-1 release early in the OGTT.",10.1007/s00125-018-4737-5,,,,1241
137,Efficacy and long-term prognosis of gastrojejunostomy for malignant gastric outlet obstruction: A systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis.,"Gastrojejunostomy (GJ) is becoming a standard surgical treatment for ameliorating malignant gastric outlet obstruction (MGOO). However, data on the long-term outcomes of MGOO treatment are lacking. This network meta-analysis aimed to compare overall survival (OS) rates and subsequent anticancer treatment outcomes of GJwith other therapies in MGOO. We searched four electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from inception to August 1, 2022. Studies reporting OS associated with GJ versus other treatments for MGOO were selected. The study was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The primary outcome assessed was OS, whereas the secondary outcome was subsequent anticancer treatment. We performed a Bayesian network meta-analysis to produce hazard ratios (HR) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs). We identified 24 retrospective studies that included 2473 patients. The studies assessed the outcomes of six treatments to alleviate MGOO. Results showed that GJ (hazard ratio: 0.83, 95% CrI: 0.78-0.88) was the most effective treatment for patients with MGOO, with the greatest surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values (79.9%) versus non-resection, palliative chemotherapy (13.9%) in terms of OS. Similarly, GJ (SUCRA: 46.5%) improved subsequent anticancer treatment requirements, ranking second only to jejunostomy/gastrostomy (JT/GT) (SUCRA: 95.9%). Our study demonstrates that GJ improves OS and follow-up treatments versus other non-resection treatments in patients with MGOO. These findings may serve for selecting appropriate therapy for MGOO.",10.1016/j.ejso.2023.06.019,,,,1242
727,Endoscopic Dilation of Bariatric RNY Anastomotic Strictures: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Gastrojejunostomy anastomotic strictures are a complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery without an established treatment guideline. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to determine the safety and efficacy of endoscopic dilation in their management. PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central (1994-2017) were searched. Data was analyzed with random effects meta-analysis and mixed effects meta-regression. Twenty-one observational studies (896 patients) were included. The stricture rate for laparoscopic patients was 6% (95% CI, 5-9%). Only 38% (95% CI, 30-47%) required greater than one dilation. Symptom improvement occurred in 97% (95% CI, 94-98%). The complication rate was 4% (95% CI, 3-6%). Endoscopic dilation of GJA strictures is safe, effective, and sustaining. This study can guide endoscopists in the treatment of a common bariatric surgical complication.",10.1007/s11695-018-3491-6,,,,1243
1419,Treatment of ring slippage after gastric bypass: long-term results after endoscopic dilation with an achalasia balloon (with videos).,"Silastic rings are used in gastric bypass procedures for the treatment of obesity, but ring slippage may lead to gastric pouch outlet stenosis (GPOS). Conventional management has been ring removal through abdominal surgery. To describe a novel, safe, minimally invasive, endoscopic technique for the treatment of GPOS caused by ring slippage after gastric bypass. Case series. Federal University of Pernambuco and SÃ£o Paulo University. This study involved 39 consecutive patients who were screened for inclusion. Endoscopic dilation with an achalasia balloon. Technical success and safety of the procedure. Among the 39 patients, 35 underwent endoscopic dilation at the ring slippage site for the relief of GPOS. The 4 patients who did not undergo endoscopic dilation underwent surgical removal of the ring, based on the exclusion criteria. The endoscopic approach was successful in 1 to 4 sessions in 100% of cases with radioscopic control (n = 12). The duration of the procedures ranged from 5 to 30 minutes, and the average internment was 14.4 hours. Dilation promoted either rupture (65.7%) or stretching (34.3%) of the thread within the ring, thereby increasing the luminal diameter of the GPOS. Complications included self-limited upper digestive tract hemorrhage (n = 1) and asymptomatic ring erosion (n = 4). There were no recurrences of obstructive symptoms during the follow-up period (mean of 33.3 months). This was not a randomized, comparison study, and the number of patients was relatively small. The technique described promotes the relief of GPOS with low overall morbidity and avoids abdominal reoperation for ring removal.",10.1016/j.gie.2010.01.057,,,,1244
1413,[Bone mass loss after sleeve gastrectomy: a prospective comparative study with gastric bypass].,"Bariatric surgery is the most effective option for the treatment of patients with a high risk of complications due to their obesity. However, it brings about a series of changes in calcium and vitamin D metabolism and an increase in resorption which lead to a loss of bone mass. The objective of this study is to compare sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) as regards loss of bone mass using bone densitometry and bone remodelling markers. Fifteen women with morbid obesity were included, 8 by SG and 7 by RYGB, with a mean age of 47.8+/-9 and mean body mass index 43.3+/-3.4. Bone mass measurements were made on the lumbar spine, femur and distal radius, and the bone remodelling markers N-telopeptide (NTx) and bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP), as well as vitamin D levels before and 12 months after surgery. A significant bone mass loss was observed was observed with SG and RYGB, in the lumbar spine and hip, whilst no differences were observed in the radial. The percentage bone mass loss was less in the column and femur after SG than with RYGB, although it did not reach statistical significance, 4.6%+/-4.4 (mean+/-SD) and 6.3%+/-5.4 (mean+/-SD), respectively. At 12 months the Ntx increased for both types of surgery, and the BAP was only increased for SG. SG causes less, although not significant, bone mass loss compared to RYGB.",10.1016/j.ciresp.2010.04.008,,,,1245
1464,Enteral nutrition and biliopancreatic diversion effectively minimize impacts of gastroparesis after pancreaticoduodenectomy.,"Since gastroparesis is unavoidable in a certain proportion of patients after pancreaticoduodenectomy, measures to avoid its occurrence or at least minimize its impact are needed. A prospective randomized trial was performed to test the effectiveness of biliopancreatic diversion with modified Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy reconstruction and of enteral feeding to minimize impacts of gastroparesis after pancreaticoduodenectomy. In total, 247 patients with periampullary tumors were randomized at the time of pancreaticoduodenectomy to have either (1) modified Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy reconstruction (by creating a side-to-side jejunojejunostomy between afferent and efferent loop and closing the afferent loop with a TA-30-3.5 stapler) and insertion of a jejunostomy feeding tube (modified group) or (2) conventional gastric bypass (control group). Outcomes including complications, duration of nasogastric tube placement, and length of hospital stay were followed prospectively. Gastroparesis occurred in 20 patients (16.3%) in the modified group and 27 patients in the control group (21.7%, P = 0.27). However, the International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery grades of gastroparesis were significantly lower in the modified group (10A, 5B, 5C) than in the control group (4A, 5B, 18C, P = 0.01). Modified procedure does not reduce the risk of gastroparesis but appears to reduce the severity when it occurs.",10.1007/s11605-009-0831-9,,,,1246
936,Differential Changes in Gut Microbiota After Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy Bariatric Surgery Vary According to Diabetes Remission.,"It is unclear whether specific gut microbiota is associated with remission of type 2 diabetes (T2D) after distinct types of bariatric surgery. The aim of this study is to examine gut microbiota changes after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) surgery in obese patients with T2D. Whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing of DNA fragments using Illumina HiSeq2000 was obtained from stool samples collected from 14 obese T2D patients pre-operatively (while on very low calorie diet) and 1Â year after randomisation to laparoscopic SG (nÂ =Â 7) or RYGB (nÂ =Â 7). Resulting shotgun reads were annotated with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Body weight reduction and dietary change was similar 1Â year after both surgery types. Identical proportions (nÂ =Â 5/7) achieved diabetes remission (HbA1cÂ <Â 48Â mmol/mol without medications) 1Â year after RYGB and SG. RYGB resulted in increased Firmicutes and Actinobacteria phyla but decreased Bacteroidetes phyla. SG resulted in increased Bacteroidetes phyla. Only an increase in Roseburia species was observed among those achieving diabetes remission, common to both surgery types. KEGG Orthology and pathway analysis predicted contrasting and greater gut microbiota metabolism changes after diabetes remission following RYGB than after SG. Those with persistent diabetes post-operatively had higher Desulfovibrio species pre-operatively. Overall, RYGB produces greater and more predicted favourable changes in gut microbiota functional capacity than SG. An increase in Roseburia species was the only compositional change common to both types of surgery among those achieving diabetes remission.",10.1007/s11695-016-2399-2,,,,1247
1619,Cardiac function during laparoscopic vs open gastric bypass.,"Hypercarbia and increased intraabdominal pressure during prolonged pneumoperitoneum can adversely affect cardiac function. This study compared the intraoperative hemodynamics of morbidly obese patients during laparoscopic and open gastric bypass (GBP). Fifty-one patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 40-60 kg/m2 were randomly allocated to undergo laparoscopic (n = 25) or open (n = 26) GBP. Cardiac output (CO), mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP), pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP), central venous pressure (CVP), heart rate (HR), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded at baseline, intraoperatively at 30-min intervals, and in the recovery room. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and stroke volume (SV) were also calculated. The two groups were similar in terms of age, weight, and BMI. Operative time was longer in the laparoscopic than in the open group (p < 0.05). The HR and MAP increased significantly from baseline intraoperatively, but there was no significant difference between the two groups. In the laparoscopic group, CO was unchanged after insufflation, but it increased by 5.3% at 2.5 h compared to baseline and by 43% compared to baseline in the recovery room. In contrast, during open GBP, CO increased significantly by 25% after surgical incision and remained elevated throughout the operation. CO was higher during open GBP than during laparoscopic GBP at 0.5 h and at 1 h after surgical incision (p < 0.05). During laparoscopic GBP, CVP, MPAP, and SVR increased transiently and PAWP remained unchanged. During open GBP, CVP, MPAP, and PAWP decreased transiently and SVR remained unchanged. There was no significant difference in the amount of intraoperative fluid administered during laparoscopic (5.5 +/- 1.6 L) and open (5.6 +/- 1.7 L) GBP. Prolonged pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic gastric bypass does not impair cardiac function and is well tolerated by morbidly obese patients.",10.1007/s00464-001-8159-x,,,,1248
1034,Link Between Increased Satiety Gut Hormones and Reduced Food Reward After Gastric Bypass Surgery for Obesity.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery is an effective long-term intervention for weight loss maintenance, reducing appetite, and also food reward, via unclear mechanisms. To investigate the role of elevated satiety gut hormones after RYGB, we examined food hedonic-reward responses after their acute post-prandial suppression. These were randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover experimental medicine studies. Two groups, more than 5 months after RYGB for obesity (n = 7-11), compared with nonobese controls (n = 10), or patients after gastric banding (BAND) surgery (n = 9) participated in the studies. Studies were performed after acute administration of the somatostatin analog octreotide or saline. In one study, patients after RYGB, and nonobese controls, performed a behavioral progressive ratio task for chocolate sweets. In another study, patients after RYGB, and controls after BAND surgery, performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging food picture evaluation task. Octreotide increased both appetitive food reward (breakpoint) in the progressive ratio task (n = 9), and food appeal (n = 9) and reward system blood oxygen level-dependent signal (n = 7) in the functional magnetic resonance imaging task, in the RYGB group, but not in the control groups. Octreotide suppressed postprandial plasma peptide YY, glucagon-like peptide-1, and fibroblast growth factor-19 after RYGB. The reduction in plasma peptide YY with octreotide positively correlated with the increase in brain reward system blood oxygen level-dependent signal in RYGB/BAND subjects, with a similar trend for glucagon-like peptide-1. Enhanced satiety gut hormone responses after RYGB may be a causative mechanism by which anatomical alterations of the gut in obesity surgery modify behavioral and brain reward responses to food.",10.1210/jc.2015-2665,,,,1249
503,Surgery-Induced Weight Loss and Changes in Hormonally Active Fibroblast Growth Factors: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to investigate the possible changes of FGF-19 and FGF-21 after bariatric surgery (BS). Electronic databases including PubMed and Scopus were systematically searched up to February 2020 to identify pertinent studies. A total of 25 different studies were included. The overall pooled analysis identified that BS caused a significant increase in FGF-19, but had no significant effect on FGF-21. For FGF-19, this finding was supported in the subgroup analyses. For FGF-21, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery significantly increased FGF-21 levels, whereas, in studies with follow-up duration â‰¥â€‰1Â year, FGF-21 levels decreased significantly. BS reduces circulating concentration of FGF-19, but might increase FGF-21 after RYGB or decrease FGF-21 after â‰¥â€‰1Â year.",10.1007/s11695-020-04807-7,,,,1250
921,Bariatric surgery for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: A clinical and cost-effectiveness analysis.,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) affects 2%-3% of the US population and is expected to become the leading indication for liver transplantation in the next decade. Bariatric surgery may be an effective but expensive treatment for NASH. Using a state-transition model, our analysis assessed the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of surgery to manage NASH. We simulated the benefits and harms of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in patients defined by weight class (overweight, mild obesity, moderate obesity, and severe obesity) and fibrosis stage (F0-F3). Comparators included intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) and no treatment. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. Our results showed that surgery and ILI in obese patients (with F0-F3) increased QALYs by 0.678-2.152 and 0.452-0.618, respectively, compared with no treatment. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for surgery in all F0-F3 patients with mild, moderate, or severe obesity were $48,836/QALY, $24,949/QALY, and $19,222/QALY, respectively. In overweight patients (with F0-F3), surgery increased QALYs by 0.050-0.824 and ILI increased QALYs by 0.031-0.164. In overweight patients, it was cost-effective to reserve treatment only for F3 patients; the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for providing surgery or ILI only to F3 patients were $30,484/QALY and $25,367/QALY, respectively. Surgery was both effective and cost-effective for obese patients with NASH, regardless of fibrosis stage; in overweight patients, surgery increased QALYs for all patients regardless of fibrosis stage, but was cost-effective only for patients with F3 fibrosis; our results highlight the promise of bariatric surgery for treating NASH and underscore the need for clinical trials in this area.

1112,Effects of a very low calorie diet in the preoperative stage of bariatric surgery: a randomized trial.,"Preoperative bariatric patients can follow very low calorie diets (VLCD), reducing surgical risks. However, possible advantages of a liquid diet over one of normal consistency are controversial. This study investigated the effect of a liquid VLCD compared with one of normal consistency considering visceral fat (VF) loss and metabolic profile in preoperative clinically severe obese patients. This was a randomized, open-labeled, controlled clinical trial. Patients were divided into 2 groups: liquid diet and normal diet. Data were collected at baseline and 7 and 14 days after intervention. Information gathered was analyzed for loss of weight and VF, biochemical data, anthropometric data, and energy intake. Fifty-seven patients consumed the liquid diet and 47 consumed the normal consistency diet. The liquid diet group lost significantly more weight (P<.0290) and VF (P<.0410) than the normal diet group. An inverse correlation occurred between VF loss and surgical time among the liquid diet group (r2=-.1302, P=.001). Additionally, there was a positive correlation between the percentage of excess weight loss and ketonuria (P=.0070). No between-group difference occurred regarding calorie intake. Patients that consumed a liquid diet presented a positive effect on reducing VF and greater weight loss than the normal diet group. Both VLCDs presented benefits offering a protective effect during the preoperative stage.",10.1016/j.soard.2014.06.007,,,,1252
1164,Upregulation of intestinal glucose transporters after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass to prevent carbohydrate malabsorption.,"To determine the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on the expression of intestinal sweet taste receptors (STRs), glucose transporters (GTs), glucose absorption, and glycemia. Intestinal biopsies were collected for mRNA expression of STR (T1R2) and GTs (SGLT-1 and GLUT2) from 11 non-diabetic RYGB, 13 non-diabetic obese, and 11 healthy subjects, at baseline and following a 30 min small intestinal (SI) glucose infusion (30 g/150 ml water with 3 g 3-O-methyl-d-glucopyranose (3-OMG)). Blood glucose, plasma 3-OMG, and insulin were measured for 270 min. In RYGB patients, expression of both GTs was âˆ¼2-fold higher at baseline and after glucose infusion than those of morbidly obese or healthy subjects (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). STR expressions were comparable amongst the groups. Peak plasma 3-OMG in both RYGB (râ€‰=â€‰0.69, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01) and obese (râ€‰=â€‰0.72, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.005) correlated with baseline expression of SGLT-1, as was the case with peak blood glucose in RYGB subjects (râ€‰=â€‰0.69, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.02). The upregulated intestinal GTs in RYGB patients are associated with increased glucose absorption when glucose is delivered at a physiological rate, suggesting a molecular adaptation to prevent carbohydrate malabsorption from rapid intestinal transit after RYGB.",10.1002/oby.20829,,,,1253
1634,Wound closure technique and acute wound complications in gastric surgery for morbid obesity: a prospective randomized trial.,"During the past 10 years, numerous clinical studies have supported the use of continuous monofilament fascial closure after laparotomy. Because of the increased incidence of surgical-site infections and other acute wound complications in the morbidly obese, these patients are well suited for a study of technical factors that may affect the frequency of these wound complications. A prospective, randomized study of the midline fascial closure technique in gastric bariatric operations was conducted between 1991 and 1998 in 331 consecutive morbidly obese patients. At the time of closure of the upper midline laparotomy wound, the patients were randomized into two groups: Group I patients (n = 172) underwent continuous fascial closure and group II patients (n = 159) underwent interrupted fascial closure. All patients received prophylactic antibiotics in a similar fashion. Wounds were monitored for 30 days postoperatively, and acute wound complications were classified as superficial or deep. Superficial complications included superficial surgical-site infections, seromas, and hematomas. In all superficial complications, the fascia remained uninvolved and intact. Deep wound complications included deep surgical-site infections and fascial dehiscence. A total of 49 acute wound complications occurred (15%). There were 22 superficial (7%) and 27 deep (8%) wound complications in the 331 in the patients studied. Group I patients experienced fewer total wound complications than group II patients (18 versus 31; p=0.021). Group I patients also experienced fewer deep wound complications than group II (5 versus 22; p = 0.003). Continuous fascial closure reduces major acute wound complications in morbidly obese patients undergoing gastric operations for obesity.",10.1016/s1072-7515(00)00353-7,,,,1254
1081,Physical Activity in the Immediate Postoperative Phase in Patients Undergoing Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass-a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"The purpose of this study is to register the number of steps taken during the first postoperative week by patients who underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (LRYGB) and evaluate whether goals for steps taken per day could affect the patients' physical activity level, time to first flatus and stool, days at hospital, and recovery. Fifty-five patients undergoing LRYGB surgery carried a step counter on the first postoperative week and recorded the number of steps taken. They also registered hours spent sitting, lying down and sleeping, assessed their level of recovery, and noted the first day of flatus and defecation. The intervention group was informed to try to reach a daily goal regarding the number of steps to be taken. The patients took 2000-3000 steps/day on the first postoperative days. There were significant differences between the groups in numbers of steps taken in favor of the intervention group on four of the postoperative days. The patients in the intervention group found that the goals were set at the right level, except for the second day, where they thought 1300 steps were too few. There were no significant differences between the groups in the mean time spent sitting or lying. Neither were there any differences in time for first flatus, stool, days at hospital, nor degree of recovery. Goals set for steps taken per day increase the amount of steps walked in patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery. Step counters and predefined goals can be used to facilitate mobilization after obesity surgery.",10.1007/s11695-015-1690-y,,,,1255
970,Assessment of Cardiopulmonary Responses to Treadmill Walking Following Gastric Bypass Surgery.,"Studies that have evaluated cardiopulmonary responses to exercise within the first few months of bariatric surgery have utilized cycle ergometry. However, walking is the most commonly reported mode of both pre- and post-operative PA. The divergent cardiopulmonary responses and metabolic costs of weight-bearing (walking) and non-weight-bearing (cycling) exercises warrant examination of the effects of bariatric surgery on cardiopulmonary responses during walking. Nine women completed a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test on a treadmill 2Â weeks before and 3Â months after gastric bypass surgery (GBS). Heart rate (HR), oxygen uptake (VO2), oxygen pulse (O2-p), and time to fatigue were compared before and after surgery and between the GBS group and a comparison group of 12 normal-weight (NW) women who completed the same exercise testing protocol. Time to fatigue increased by ~140Â s following GBS (pÂ =Â 0.018). No other parameter improved during maximal exercise from pre- to post-surgery. Body weight- and fat-free mass-corrected VO2 and O2-p at peak exercise differed between the GBS and NW groups before surgery, while only weight-corrected values were different following surgery. These differences disappeared after controlling for body fat percentage. We have demonstrated that weight loss alone was not sufficient to improve select cardiopulmonary fitness measures during treadmill walking in obese females 3Â months after GBS. However, we did observe a significant overall improvement in exercise capacity as the GBS group was able to exercise longer, presumably due to significant reductions in body mass and a subsequent reduced metabolic cost of walking.",10.1007/s11695-016-2259-0,,,,1256
148,Use of lumen-apposing metal stents in treating gastrojejunal anastomotic strictures in bariatric patients.,"Gastrojejunal strictures (GJS) are rare but significant adverse events following Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass, with limited options for effective non-operative interventions. Lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMS) represent a new therapy for treatment of intestinal strictures, but the effectiveness in treating GJS is unknown. This study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of LAMS in GJS. This is a prospective, observational study of patients with prior Roux-en-Y Gastric bypass who underwent LAMS placement for GJS. The primary outcome of interest is resolution of GJS following LAMS removal defined by toleration of bariatric diet after LAMS removal. Secondary outcomes include need for additional procedures, LAMS-related adverse events, and need for revisional surgery. Twenty patients were enrolled. The cohort was 85% female with median age of 43. 65% had marginal ulcers associated with the GJS. Presenting symptoms included nausea and vomiting (50% of patients), dysphagia (50%), epigastric pain (20%), and failure to thrive (10%). Diameter of LAMS placed were 15Â mm in 15 patients, 20Â mm in 3 patients, and 10Â mm in 2 patients. LAMS were placed for a median of 58Â days (IQR 56-70). Twelve patients (60%) achieved resolution of GJS after LAMS removal. Of the eight patients without GJS resolution or with recurrence, seven (35%) required repeat placement of LAMS. One patient was lost to follow up. One perforation and two migrations occurred. Four patients required revisional surgery after LAMS removal. LAMS placement is well-tolerated and effective with most patients achieving short-term symptom resolution and with few reported complications. While stricture resolution occurred in over half the patients, nearly 1/4th of patients required revisional surgery. More data is needed to predict who would benefit from LAMS versus surgical intervention.",10.1007/s00464-023-10117-7,,,,1257
664,Role of adipose tissue GLP-1R expression in metabolic improvement after bariatric surgery in patients with type 2 diabetes.,"We aimed to explore the relationship between GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) expression in adipose tissue (AT) and incretin secretion, glucose homeostasis and weight loss, in patients with morbid obesity and type 2 diabetes undergoing bariatric surgery. RNA was extracted from subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) AT biopsies from 40 patients randomized to metabolic gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy or greater curvature plication. Biochemical parameters, fasting plasma insulin, glucagon and area under the curve (AUC) of GLP-1 following a standard meal test were determined before and 1 year after bariatric surgery. GLP-1R expression was higher in VAT than in SAT. GLP-1R expression in VAT correlated with weight (râ€‰=â€‰-0.453, pâ€‰=â€‰0.008), waist circumference (râ€‰=â€‰-0.494, pâ€‰=â€‰0.004), plasma insulin (râ€‰=â€‰-0.466, pâ€‰=â€‰0.007), and systolic blood pressure (BP) (râ€‰=â€‰-0.410, pâ€‰=â€‰0.018). At 1 year, GLP-1R expression in VAT was negatively associated with diastolic BP (râ€‰=â€‰-0.361, pâ€‰=â€‰0.039) and, following metabolic gastric bypass, with the increase of GLP-1 AUC, (R2â€‰=â€‰0.46, pâ€‰=â€‰0.038). Finally, GLP-1R in AT was similar independently of diabetes outcomes and was not associated with weight loss after surgery. Thus, GLP-1R expression in AT is of limited value to predict incretin response and does not play a role in metabolic outcomes after bariatric surgery.",10.1038/s41598-019-42770-1,,,,1258
484,Survival analysis of a prospective multicenter observational study on surgical palliation among patients receiving treatment for malignant gastric outlet obstruction caused by incurable advanced gastric cancer.,"We had previously reported that surgical palliation could maintain quality of life (QOL) while improving solid food intake among patients with malignant gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) caused by advanced gastric cancer. The present study aimed to perform a survival analysis according to the patients' QOL to elucidate its impact on survival. Patients with GOO who underwent either palliative gastrectomy or gastrojejunostomy were included in this study. A validated QOL instrument (EQ-5D) was used to assess QOL at baseline and 2Â weeks, 1Â month, and 3Â months following surgical palliation. Postoperative improvement in oral intake was also evaluated using the GOO scoring system (GOOSS). Thereafter, univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed to determine independent prognostic factors. The median survival time of the 104 patients included herein was 11.30Â months. Patients who received postoperative chemotherapy, PS 0/1, baseline EQ-5Dâ€‰â‰¥â€‰0.75, improved or stable EQ-5D, and improved oral intake expressed as GOOSSâ€‰=â€‰3 had significantly better survival. Multivariate analysis identified postoperative chemotherapy, a better baseline PS, a better baseline EQ5D, improved or stable EQ5D scores, and improved oral intake 3Â months after surgical palliation as independent prognostic factors. Apart from preoperative PS and postoperative chemotherapy, the present study identified better baseline QOL, improvement in postoperative QOL, and improvement in oral intake as prognostic factors among patients who underwent palliative surgery for advanced gastric cancer with GOO.",10.1007/s10120-020-01114-z,,,,1259
317,Evaluation of Metabolic Outcomes Following SADI-S: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Single anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S) offers a novel bariatric procedure. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates observational and comparative studies evaluating SADI-S, with meta-analysis comparing outcomes to other malabsorptive procedures (MPs). Systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted in March 2021. The study followed PRISMA guidelines. Studies evaluating SADI-S with nâ€‰>â€‰5 were included. Primary outcome was diabetes (DM) remission, and secondary outcomes included perioperative outcomes, comorbidity resolution, and weight loss. We reviewed 2285 studies with 16 included evaluating 3319 patients and 1704 (51.3%) undergoing SADI-S. SADI-S patients had increased BMI (49.6Â kg/m2 vs 48.8Â kg/m2) and weight (139.7Â kg vs 137.1Â kg), were more likely to have DM (46.3% vs 42.1%), and dyslipidemia (36.6% SADI-S vs 32.7%). SADI-S had a shorter operative duration than MPs (MDâ€‰-â€‰36.74, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), 0.85-day shorter post-operative stay (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and trended towards fewer complications (OR 0.69, pâ€‰=â€‰0.06). Rate of reoperation (OR 0.83, pâ€‰=â€‰0.59) was similar and DM remission was similar (OR 0.07, pâ€‰=â€‰0.1). Subgroup analysis suggested greater DM remission than Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (OR 4.42, pâ€‰=â€‰0.04). SADI-S had fewer malabsorptive complications, though follow-up was shorter. Weight loss was 37.3% compared to 35.6% total weight loss after SADI-S and MPs, respectively. SADI-S demonstrates improved metabolic and weight loss outcomes with lower perioperative risks. SADI-S represents a promising bariatric procedure but long-term outcomes are needed to guide future uptake.",10.1007/s11695-021-05824-w,,,,1260
1000,Copper Deficiency after Gastric Bypass for Morbid Obesity: a Systematic Review.,"A large number of patients undergoing bariatric surgery are deficient in copper, and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can further aggravate it. Delays in diagnosis and treatment of copper deficiency can leave patients with residual neurological disability. This has led to recommendation from the British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society that copper levels should be monitored annually after gastric bypass. This review concludes that copper deficiency in adequately supplemented patients is rare and can be adequately treated if a related haematological or neurological disorder is diagnosed. The cost of routine monitoring may therefore not be justified for adequately supplemented, asymptomatic patients who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The screening may however be necessary for high-risk patient groups to prevent severe complications and permanent disability.",10.1007/s11695-016-2162-8,,,,1261
269,Changes in Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide (GIP) After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in Obese Patients: a Meta-analysis.,"This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate changes in GIP after RYGB in obese patients. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL for relevant studies from database inception through July 2021. Articles were eligible for inclusion if they reported pre-operative and post-operative fasting GIP levels. We found fasting GIP levels had a decreasing tendency. The decrease in fasting glucose and postprandial GIP levels was also observed. Subgroup analysis indicated diabetic subjects tended to have a more obvious fasting GIP reduction compared to non-diabetic individuals. Meta-regression showed that the amount of weight loss (% total body weight), gastric pouch volume, alimentary limb length, and biliopancreatic limb length were not related to fasting GIP decrease. Fasting GIP levels decreased significantly after RYGB in obese people, especially in diabetic patients.",10.1007/s11695-022-05959-4,,,,1262
244,Cost-effectiveness of ursodeoxycholic acid in preventing new-onset symptomatic gallstone disease after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.,"The aim was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) prophylaxis for the prevention of symptomatic gallstone disease after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in patients without gallstones before surgery. Data from a multicentre, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled superiority trial were used. Patients scheduled for laparoscopic RYGB or sleeve gastrectomy were randomized to receive 900â€…mg UDCA or placebo for 6 months. Indicated by the clinical report, prophylactic prescription of UDCA was evaluated economically against placebo from a healthcare and societal perspective for the subgroup of patients without gallstones before surgery who underwent RYGB. Volumes and costs of in-hospital care, out-of-hospital care, out-of-pocket expenses, and productivity loss were assessed. Main outcomes were the costs per patient free from symptomatic gallstone disease and the costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Patients receiving UDCA prophylaxis were more likely to remain free from symptomatic gallstone disease (relative risk 1.06, 95 per cent c.i. 1.02 to 1.11; P = 0.002) compared with patients in the placebo group. The gain in QALYs, corrected for a baseline difference in health utility, was 0.047 (95 per cent bias-corrected and accelerated (Bca) c.i. 0.007 to 0.088) higher (P = 0.022). Differences in costs were -â‚¬356 (95 per cent Bca c.i. â‚¬-1573 to 761) from a healthcare perspective and -â‚¬1392 (-3807 to 917) from a societal perspective including out-of-pocket expenses and productivity loss, both statistically non-significant, in favour of UDCA prophylaxis. The probability of UDCA prophylaxis being cost-effective was at least 0.872. UDCA prophylaxis after RYGB in patients without gallstones before surgery was cost-effective.",10.1093/bjs/znac273,,,,1263
752,Laparoscopic-Guided Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) Block as Part of Multimodal Analgesia in Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Within an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Program: a Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Despite the ultrasound guidance of transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks has allowed greater precision of needle placement in the desired tissue plane, visualization of the abdominal wall muscles can be hindered by morbid obesity and could lead to failed regional anesthesia. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and effect of laparoscopic-guided TAP block in patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and to compare it with port-site infiltration. A prospective randomized clinical trial was performed. Patients were randomized into two groups: patients undergoing laparoscopic-guided TAP (TAP-lap) and patients undergoing port-site infiltration (PSI). Pain quantification as measured by visual analogic scale (VAS) and morphine needs during the first 24Â h were evaluated. One hundred and forty patients were included, 70 in each group. The mean operation time was 83.3â€‰+â€‰15.6Â min in TAP-lap and 80.5â€‰+â€‰14.4Â min in PSI (NS). The mean postoperative pain, as measured by VAS, 24Â h after surgery was 16.8Â +â€‰11.2Â mm in PSI and 10â€‰+â€‰8.1Â mm in TAP-lap (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001). Morphine rescues were necessary in 13.2% in PSI and 2.9% in TAP-lap (pâ€‰=â€‰0.026). The mean hospital stay was 2.1â€‰+â€‰1.2Â days in TAP-lap and 2.9â€‰+â€‰1.3Â days in PSI (pâ€‰=â€‰0.019). Hospital discharge during the first 48Â h after surgery was possible in 52.9% of the patients in PSI and 71% in TAP-lap (OR 4.75; 95% CI 2.1-10.8; pâ€‰=â€‰0.029). Laparoscopic-guided TAP block can reduce postoperative pain, opioid needs, and hospital stay, when compared with port-site infiltration with the same anesthetic drug, without increasing operation time.

111,Prevalence and associated factors of vitamin D deficiency after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To estimate the prevalence and associated factors of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched for relevant records from inception to 17 March 2023, using search terms: vitamin D, vitamin D3, vitamin D deficiency, hypovitaminosis D, gastric bypass, and RYGB. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they provided related data on VDD prevalence after RYGB. Of the 1119 screened studies, 72 studies involving 7688 individuals were enrolled in the final analysis. The prevalence estimates of VDD after RYGB were 42%. Subgroup analyses suggested the pooled prevalence of postoperative VDD was 35% for follow-up duration less than or equal to 1 year, 43% for greater than 1 and less than or equal to 5 years, and 54% for greater than 5 years. Meta-regression showed that VDD prevalence was positively correlated with follow-up time. Also, the prevalence was higher in studies with inadequate vitamin D supplementation than in those with adequate supplementation and in Asia population than in those from South America, Europe, and North America. Other factors associated with high VDD prevalence after RYGB included high presurgical VDD prevalence, noncompliant patients, and black populations. No significant association existed between VDD and alimentary length. VDD presented a high prevalence in patients following RYGB. It occurred more frequently with longer postoperative follow-up time. Population-specific vitamin D supplementation measures, targeted treatment for presurgical VDD, improved patient compliance, and periodical follow-ups were necessary to reduce VDD and other adverse outcomes.",10.1097/JS9.0000000000000732,,,,1265
1331,Endoscopic stenting versus gastrojejunostomy for palliation of malignant gastric outlet obstruction.,"The aim of the present study was to analyze endoscopic stenting versus gastrojejunostomy of malignant gastric outlet obstruction (GOO). A systematic review of the literature was undertaken to analyze clinical trials on GOO. Six studies were eligible for analysis (three randomized control trials and three controlled clinical trials). Technical success (OR [95% CI]: 0.10 [0.02, 0.47]; I(2) = 0%; P = 0.003) and minor complications (OR [95% CI]: 0.28 [0.10, 0.83]; I(2) = 49%; P = 0.02). Time to oral intake and length of survival were also shorter in the endoscopic stenting (ES) group. There was no statistically significant difference in clinical success, length of survival, mortality and major complications. The present review demonstrated potentially improved quality of life in the ES group. ES is a safe and effective, minimally invasive and cost-effective option for palliation of malignant gastric outlet obstruction. The present review provides supportive evidence that ES should be considered as the gold standard treatment for malignant GOO.",10.1111/j.1443-1661.2011.01186.x,,,,1266
407,Orosensory Perception of Fat/Sweet Stimuli and Appetite-Regulating Peptides before and after Sleeve Gastrectomy or Gastric Bypass in Adult Women with Obesity.,"The aim of this study was to explore the impact of bariatric surgery on fat and sweet taste perceptions and to determine the possible correlations with gut appetite-regulating peptides and subjective food sensations. Women suffering from severe obesity (BMI > 35 kg/m2) were studied 2 weeks before and 6 months after a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG, n = 32) or a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB, n = 12). Linoleic acid (LA) and sucrose perception thresholds were determined using the three-alternative forced-choice procedure, gut hormones were assayed before and after a test meal and subjective changes in oral food sensations were self-reported using a standardized questionnaire. Despite a global positive effect of both surgeries on the reported gustatory sensations, a change in the taste sensitivity was only found after RYGB for LA. However, the fat and sweet taste perceptions were not homogenous between patients who underwent the same surgery procedure, suggesting the existence of two subgroups: patients with and without taste improvement. These gustatory changes were not correlated to the surgery-mediated modifications of the main gut appetite-regulating hormones. Collectively these data highlight the complexity of relationships between bariatric surgery and taste sensitivity and suggest that VSG and RYGB might impact the fatty taste perception differently.",10.3390/nu13030878,,,,1267
47,Three-dimensional Versus Two-dimensional Laparoscopic Bariatric Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Three-dimensional (3D) laparoscopy has several advantages in gastrointestinal surgery. This systematic review determined whether similar benefits exist for bariatric surgical procedures by systematically searching the MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus databases. Six studies including 629 patients who underwent 2D (386) and 3D (243) laparoscopic bariatric surgeries were selected. Operative time was significantly shorter in patients undergoing 3D laparoscopic gastric bypass (pooled standardized mean difference [SMD] 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.22-0.15). Similarly, a shorter hospital stay was detected both during sleeve gastrectomy (SMD 0.42, 95% CI 0.70-0.13) and gastric bypass (SMD 0.39, 95% CI 0.64-0.14) with 3D laparoscopy. The study showed the potential benefit of 3D imaging in preventing intra- and postoperative complications. Despite the limited evidence, surgeons may benefit from 3D laparoscopy during bariatric surgery.",10.1007/s11695-024-07222-4,,,,1268
654,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis comparing open, laparoscopic, and robotic approach.","The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is performed via an open (OpenRYGB), laparoscopic (LapRYGB), or robotic (RoRYGB) approach. Previous review evidence is limited to pairwise meta-analysis, and RoRYGB versus OpenRYGB comparison is lacking. The aim of this network meta-analysis was to globally compare short-term outcomes within the open, laparoscopic, and robotic surgical approaches to RYGB. PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were consulted. A fully Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to compare OpenRYGB, LapRYGB, and RoRYGB. Nineteen studies, for a total of 276,732 patients, were included. Overall, 28.8% of the patients underwent OpenRYGB, 67.3% LapRYGB, and 3.9% RoRYGB. The 30-day mortality was significantly lower for both LapRYGB and RoRYGB versus OpenRYGB (risk ratio [RR] = .64, 95% credible interval [CrI] .46-.97, and RR = .49, 95% CrI .24-.99, respectively). The overall complication rate was significantly lower for both LapRYGB and RoRYGB versus OpenRYGB (RR = .63, 95% CrI .42-.91, and RR = .60, 95% CrI .33-.95, respectively). Anastomotic leak rate was similar for LapRYGB and RoRYGB versus OpenRYGB (RR = 1.10, 95% CrI .67-1.81, and RR = .95, 95% CrI .45-2.12, respectively). Surgical site infection (RR = .42, 95% CrI .30-.75, and RR = .24; 95% CrI .13-.58, respectively) and pulmonary complications (RR = .57, 95% CrI .45-.77, and RR = .42; 95% CrI .25-.76, respectively) were significantly lower for LapRYGB and RoRYGB versus OpenRYGB. No differences were found when postoperative bleeding, thromboembolic complication, 30-day reoperation, and 30-day hospital readmission were considered. This network meta-analysis suggests that both LapRYGB and RoRYGB appear to be safer compared to OpenRYGB with regard to 30-day mortality, overall complication rate, surgical site infection rate, and pulmonary complication rate. The surgical management of morbid obesity through RYGB is evolving, and the adoption of innovative minimally invasive techniques may improve patient outcomes.",10.1016/j.soard.2019.03.006,,,,1269
663,Longitudinal Impacts of Gastric Bypass Surgery on Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics of Statins.,"Undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is expected to affect orally administered drug absorption. Statins are commonly prescribed to patients with obesity for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases by lowering cholesterol. This is the first longitudinal prospective study on impacts of RYGB on weight loss, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin, and their active metabolites, up to 1-year post-surgery. Forty-six patients were recruited, five patients on atorvastatin, twelve on rosuvastatin, nine on simvastatin, and twenty on no statin. The concentrations of atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin with their active metabolites were monitored. Mean plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and metabolites and rosuvastatin normalized by the unit dose [(nM)/(mg/kg)] decreased by 3- to 6-month post-surgery. Conversely, simvastatin and its metabolite concentrations increased up to 6-month post-surgery, then declined to preoperative levels by 1-year post-surgery. The metabolisms of atorvastatin to hydroxyl-metabolites and simvastatin to simvastatin acid were decreased after RYGB. The weight loss and PD outcomes were comparable between statin and non-statin groups suggesting the key impacts were from RYGB. The discontinuation or reduction of dose of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin post-RYGB exhibited rebounds of LDL levels in some subjects, but the rebound was not apparent with patients on simvastatin pre-surgery. Discontinuations of statin dosing post-RYGB require LDL monitoring and reducing the dose to half seems to have better results. Patients on statin treatment post-RYGB should be followed-up closely based on our pharmacokinetic findings, to ensure therapeutic effects of the treatment with minimal adverse effects.",10.1007/s11695-019-03885-6,,,,1270
1088,Addictive disorders after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Recent literature suggests that some patients may develop addictive disorders after bariatric surgery, in particular after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). These may include traditional addictions and so called ""behavioral addictions,"" although prevalence data on the latter have not been published. The objective of this study was to establish the prevalence of addictive behaviors in adults after RYGB. Participants from a large observational study of bariatric surgery who had undergone RYGB were recruited to complete additional measures. Of 241 consented participants, 201 provided data (i.e., Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I [SCID], additional Impulsive Control Disorder Modules, and various self-report measures, including the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test [AUDIT]) to assess status before surgery and in the first 3 postoperative years. Based on the SCID, 16 (8.0%) developed alcohol use disorder [AUD] within 3 years post-RYGB, 7 (43.8%) of whom had no history of AUD. When both the SCID and AUDIT were used to identify AUD, the corresponding numbers/percentages were 32 (18.4%) and 13 (40.6%). Data on other behavioral addictive disorders indicated 19 (9.5%) had a postsurgery disorder, 6 (31.6%) of whom had no history. These data add to a growing literature suggesting there is a substantial risk for the development of AUD after bariatric surgery. Understanding the risk for nondrug-related addictive disorders requires more data from larger studies before clear conclusions can be drawn.",10.1016/j.soard.2014.10.026,,,,1271
1501,Grazing and loss of control related to eating: two high-risk factors following bariatric surgery.,"Gastric restrictive surgery induces a marked change in eating behavior. However, the relationship between preoperative and postoperative eating behavior and weight loss outcome has received limited attention. This study assessed a range of eating behaviors before and 1 year after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) and explored the nature and extent of change in eating patterns, their clinical associates, and impact on weight loss. A 12-month observational study assessed presurgical and postsurgical binge eating disorder (BED), uncontrolled eating, night eating syndrome (NES), grazing, nutrient intake and eating-related behaviors, and markers of psychological distress. A total of 129 subjects (26 male and 103 female, mean age 45.2 +/- 11.5 and BMI 44.3 +/- 6.8) participated in this study. Presurgical BED, uncontrolled eating, and NES occurred in 14%, 31%, and 17.1% of subjects, which reduced after surgery to 3.1%, 22.5%, and 7.8%, respectively (P = 0.05 for all). Grazing was prevalent before (26.3%) and after surgery (38.0%). Preoperative BED most frequently became grazers (P = 0.029). The average percentage weight loss (%WL) was 20.8 +/- 8.5%; range -0.67 to 50.0% and percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) 50.0 +/- 20.7%; range -1.44 to 106.9% (P < 0.001). Uncontrolled eating and grazing after surgery showed high overlap and were associated with poorer %WL (P = 0.008 and P < 0.001, respectively) and elevated psychological distress. Consistent with recent studies, uncontrolled eating and grazing were identified as two high-risk eating patterns after surgery. Clearer characterization of favorable and unfavorable postsurgical eating behaviors, reliable methods to assess their presence, and empirically tested postsurgical intervention strategies are required to optimize weight loss outcomes and facilitate psychological well-being in at-risk groups.",10.1038/oby.2007.101,,,,1272
1557,Heating and humidifying of carbon dioxide during pneumoperitoneum is not indicated: a prospective randomized trial.,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) pneumoperitoneum usually is created by a compressed gas source. This exposes the patient to cool dry gas delivered at room temperature (21 degrees C) with 0% relative humidity. Various delivery methods are available for humidifying and heating CO2 gas. This study was designed to determine the effects of heating and humidifying gas for the intraabdominal environment. For this study, 44 patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were randomly assigned to one of four arms in a prospective, randomized, single-blinded fashion: raw CO2 (group 1), heated CO2 (group 2), humidified CO2 (group 3), and heated and humidified CO2 (group 4). A commercially available CO2 heater-humidifier was used. Core temperatures, intraabdominal humidity, perioperative data, and postoperative outcomes were monitored. Peritoneal biopsies were taken in each group at the beginning and end of the case. Biopsies were subjected staining protocols designed to identify structural damage and macrophage activity. Postoperative narcotic use, pain scale scores, recovery room time, and length of hospital stay were recorded. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test were used to compare the groups. Demographics, volume of CO2 used, intraabdominal humidity, bladder temperatures, lens fogging, and operative times were not significantly different between the groups. Core temperatures were stable, and intraabdominal humidity measurements approached 100% for all the patients over the entire procedure. Total narcotic dosage and pain scale scores were not statistically different. Recovery room times and length of hospital stay were similar in all the groups. Only one biopsy in the heated-humidified group showed an increase in macrophage activity. The intraabdominal environment in terms of temperature and humidity was similar in all the groups. There was no significant difference in the intraoperative body temperatures or the postoperative variable measured. No histologic changes were identified. Heating or humidifying of CO2 is not justified for patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery.",10.1007/s00464-005-0271-x,,,,1273
848,Risk Factors for Prolonged Length of Hospital Stay and Readmissions After Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy and Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.,"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic gastric bypass (LRYGB) are most commonly performed bariatric procedures. Laparoscopic approach and enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols managed to decrease length of hospital and morbidity. However, there are patients in whom, despite adherence to the protocol, the length of stay (LOS) remains longer than targeted. This study aimed to assess potential risk factors for prolonged LOS and readmissions. The study was a prospective observation with a post-hoc analysis of bariatric patients in a tertiary referral university teaching hospital. Inclusion criteria were undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Exclusion criteria were occurrence of perioperative complications, prior bariatric procedures, and lack of necessary data. The primary endpoints were the evaluations of risk factors for prolonged LOS and readmissions. Median LOS was 3 (2-4) days. LOS >Â 3Â days occurred in 145 (29.47%) patients, 79 after LSG (25.82%) and 66 after LRYGB (35.48%; pÂ =Â 0.008). Factors significantly prolonging LOS were low oral fluid intake, high intravenous volume of fluids administered on POD0, and every additional 50Â km distance from habitual residence to bariatric center. The risk of hospital readmission rises with occurrence of intraoperative adverse events and low oral fluid intake on the day of surgery on. Risk factors for prolonged LOS are low oral fluid intake, high intravenous volume of fluids administered on POD0, and every additional 50Â km distance from habitual residence. Risk factors for hospital readmission are intraoperative adverse events and low oral fluid intake on the day of surgery.",10.1007/s11695-017-2844-x,,,,1274
1254,Total laparoscopic esophageal bypass using a colonic conduit for corrosive-induced esophageal stricture.,"The colon and the stomach are the most commonly used conduits for esophageal replacement in patients with esophageal strictures resulting from corrosive ingestion. The replacement surgeries have traditionally been performed by an open approach. While laparoscopic replacement surgery using a stomach conduit has been previously reported, a total laparoscopic bypass using a colonic conduit has not been previously described. We herein describe the surgical technique and results of laparoscopic esophageal bypass using a colonic conduit. Patients with corrosive stricture involving the esophagus with the proximal level at the hypopharynx, or those with concomitant gastric scarring, were selected. The surgery was performed with the patient in a supine position using five abdominal ports and a hockey stick/transverse skin crease neck incision. The main steps include colonic mobilization and assessment of the adequacy of the marginal vascular arcade, creation of a retrosternal tunnel, preparation of the colonic conduit, neck dissection, delivery of the colonic conduit into the neck and cervical pharyngo/esophagocolic anastomosis, and intra-abdominal cologastric and ileocolic anastomosis. During the study period, 39 patients with corrosive stricture of the esophagus were managed surgically at our center with either gastric or colonic bypass. Of these, 22 patients underwent an open procedure (12 retrosternal colonic bypasses and 10 retrosternal gastric bypasses) and 17 patients underwent a laparoscopic procedure (13 retrosternal gastric bypasses and 4 retrosternal colonic bypasses). Patients with stricture at the hypopharynx (nÂ =Â 2) or those in whom the stomach was contracted (nÂ =Â 2) were considered for a laparoscopic esophagocoloplasty. The average duration of surgery of these latter four patients was 370 (380, 320, 360, and 420) min and the mean estimated blood loss was 100Â mL. All patients could be ambulated on the first postoperative day and were allowed oral liquids by the 7th postoperative day. Compared with patients who underwent an open colonic bypass, there was significantly less need for analgesics. At a median follow-up of 5 (range 3-6) months, all patients are euphagic to solid diet and have excellent cosmetic results. Laparoscopic colonic bypass is an achievable, safe, and effective procedure for the management of corrosive strictures of the esophagus.",10.1007/s00464-013-2956-x,,,,1275
1345,Oral bioavailability of moxifloxacin after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery is the most commonly performed procedure for the treatment of morbid obesity. This anatomical alteration may affect the absorption and consequently the bioavailability of oral drugs. This study aims to investigate the oral bioavailability of moxifloxacin in 12 healthy volunteers who underwent gastric bypass surgery. In this randomized crossover study, each subject received two single standard doses of 400 mg of moxifloxacin orally or intravenously administered on two occasions separated by a washout period of 1 week. Serial venous blood samples were drawn up to 72 h after dosing and moxifloxacin plasma levels were measured by a validated HPLC method with fluorescence detection. [clinicaltrials.gov database (identifier: NCT01130922).] After oral dosing, moxifloxacin plasma concentrations reached a maximum (C(max)) of 3.38 Â± 1.41 mg/L after 1.75 h (0.75-4.00). After intravenous dosing, C(max) and T(max) were 4.53 Â± 1.43 mg/L and 1.03 h (0.75-2.50), respectively. The mean areas under the plasma concentration time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC(âˆž)) were 46.2 Â± 1.4 mgâ€ŠÂ·â€Šh/L after oral dosing and 52.3 Â± 1.3 mgâ€ŠÂ·â€Šh/L after intravenous dosing, resulting in a mean oral bioavailability of 88.32% [90% confidence interval (CI) 85.64%-91.08%]. This study confirms that exposure to moxifloxacin is equivalent for oral and intravenous administration of 400 mg dosages in healthy volunteers who underwent gastric bypass surgery. But these exposures were more than 50% higher than those described for subjects without gastric bypass. This may suggest a higher enterohepatic recirculation of moxifloxacin after gastric bypass.",10.1093/jac/dkr436,,,,1276
1394,Surgical results of single-incision transumbilical laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Conventional laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) has been the reference standard for bariatric surgery but requires 5-7 trocar incisions. We have developed a new procedure-single-incision transumbilical LRYGB (SITU-LRYGB)-that results in minimal scarring and is more cosmetically acceptable. To compare the surgical results and patient satisfaction between 5-port LRYGB and the novel SITU-LRYGB at a university hospital. We performed 5-port or SITU-LRYGB on 140 morbidly obese patients; the patients chose the operation method. We used a novel liver traction method and omega-umbilicoplasty specifically designed for SITU-LRYGB. Before surgery, the patients in the 5-port surgery group were more obese than those in the SITU group (120.8 kg versus 108.9 kg, P = .013). The rate of hypertension was also greater in the former group. The operative time was longer for SITU-LRYGB (101.1 versus 81.1 min, P = .001) without increased intraoperative complications. The total morphine dose for the SITU group seemed to be greater but the difference was not statistically significant. No difference in complications was observed. Postoperatively, the percentage of excess body weight lost the SITU and 5-port surgery groups was 21.2% and 20.9%, 40.4% and 39.4%, 55.0% and 55.2%, 64.8% and 75.2%, and 75.4% and 78.2% at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively. The SITU-LRYGB patients reported greater satisfaction related to scarring than those who had undergone 5-port surgery (score 4.57 versus 3.96, respectively, P = .005). No patient died. Compared with conventional LRYGB, SITU-LRYGB resulted in acceptable complications, the same recovery, comparative weight loss, and better patient satisfaction related to scarring.",10.1016/j.soard.2010.12.007,,,,1277
326,Prebiotic to Improve Calcium Absorption in Postmenopausal Women After Gastric Bypass: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"The adverse skeletal effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) are partly caused by intestinal calcium absorption decline. Prebiotics, such as soluble corn fiber (SCF), augment colonic calcium absorption in healthy individuals. We tested the effects of SCF on fractional calcium absorption (FCA), biochemical parameters, and the fecal microbiome in a post-RYGB population. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 20 postmenopausal women with history of RYGB a mean 5 years prior; a 2-month course of 20 g/day SCF or maltodextrin placebo was taken orally. The main outcome measure was between-group difference in absolute change in FCA (primary outcome) and was measured with a gold standard dual stable isotope method. Other measures included tolerability, adherence, serum calciotropic hormones and bone turnover markers, and fecal microbial composition via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Mean FCA Â± SD at baseline was low at 5.5 Â± 5.1%. Comparing SCF to placebo, there was no between-group difference in mean (95% CI) change in FCA (+3.4 [-6.7, +13.6]%), nor in calciotropic hormones or bone turnover markers. The SCF group had a wider variation in FCA change than placebo (SD 13.4% vs 7.0%). Those with greater change in microbial composition following SCF treatment had greater increase in FCA (r2 = 0.72, P = 0.05). SCF adherence was high, and gastrointestinal symptoms were similar between groups. No between-group differences were observed in changes in FCA or calciotropic hormones, but wide CIs suggest a variable impact of SCF that may be due to the degree of gut microbiome alteration. Daily SCF consumption was well tolerated. Larger and longer-term studies are warranted.",10.1210/clinem/dgab883,,,,1278
883,Metabolic responses to exogenous ghrelin in obesity and early after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in humans.,"Ghrelin is a gastric-derived hormone that stimulates growth hormone (GH) secretion and has a multi-faceted role in the regulation of energy homeostasis, including glucose metabolism. Circulating ghrelin concentrations are modulated in response to nutritional status, but responses to ghrelin in altered metabolic states are poorly understood. We investigated the metabolic effects of ghrelin in obesity and early after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). We assessed central and peripheral metabolic responses to acyl ghrelin infusion (1â€‰pmolâ€‰kg-1 â€‰min-1 ) in healthy, lean subjects (nâ€‰=â€‰9) and non-diabetic, obese subjects (nâ€‰=â€‰9) before and 2â€‰weeks after RYGB. Central responses were assessed by GH and pancreatic polypeptide (surrogate for vagal activity) secretion. Peripheral responses were assessed by hepatic and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity during a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. Ghrelin-stimulated GH secretion was attenuated in obese subjects, but was restored by RYGB to a response similar to that of lean subjects. The heightened pancreatic polypeptide response to ghrelin infusion in the obese was attenuated after RYGB. Hepatic glucose production and hepatic insulin sensitivity were not altered by ghrelin infusion in RYGB subjects. Skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity was impaired to a similar degree in lean, obese and post-RYGB individuals in response to ghrelin infusion. These data suggest that obesity is characterized by abnormal central, but not peripheral, responsiveness to ghrelin that can be restored early after RYGB before significant weight loss. Further work is necessary to fully elucidate the role of ghrelin in the metabolic changes that occur in obesity and following RYGB.",10.1111/dom.12952,,,,1279
814,Is testing for postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia after gastric bypass necessary?,"Postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (pHH) is an increasingly reported complication after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). As pHH can cause life-threatening emergencies if occurring without warning symptoms, challenge testing may detect patients at risk. The study objective was to determine the frequency of occurrence of pHH with or without symptoms of hypoglycemia after RYGB. We undertook an observational cohort study of consecutive, unselected patients approximately one year after uncomplicated RYGB. To simulate normal habits, all patients received a standardized carbohydrate-rich solid mixed meal. Plasma glucose and insulin were measured at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150Â min thereafter. Symptoms were classified as autonomous or neuroglycopenic. Patients with hypoglycemia (plasma glucose <3.0Â mmol/L [55Â mg/dL]), were tested a second time with a protein-rich solid mixed meal. 113 patients were included. Total weight loss at the first follow-up check (14Â Â±Â 0.4 months) was 33.97Â Â±Â 9.3%. After the carbohydrate-rich meal, glucose dropped to <3.0Â mmol/L in 13.2% (nÂ =Â 15) of patients vs no drop to <3.0Â mmol/L after a protein-rich meal. The pHH occurred in 11.5% (nÂ =Â 13) of patients. Asymptomatic patients (5.3%, nÂ =Â 6) carried an increased risk (pÂ =Â 0.008) for pHH. One patient needed emergency treatment after sudden loss of consciousness after the carbohydrate-rich meal. The occurrence of pHH was quite high in our study population with 11.5% thereof 5.3% asymptomatic. We therefore suggest that detection of these patients warrants a screening of patients after RYGB. At-risk patients should than be adequately advised to avoid carbohydrate-rich meals in order to optimize risk management.",10.1016/j.clnu.2017.11.013,,,,1280
97,Outcomes of Concurrent Hiatus Hernia Repair with Different Bariatric Surgery Procedures: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Hiatus hernia (HH) is prevalent among patients with obesity. Concurrent repair is often performed during metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS), but a consensus on the safety and effectiveness of concurrent HH repair (HHR) and MBS remains unclear. We performed a systematic review of the safety and effectiveness of concurrent HHR and MBS through the measurement of multiple postoperative outcomes. Seventeen studies relating to concurrent MBS and HHR were identified. MBS procedures included laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), and adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). Studies with pre- and postoperative measurements and outcomes were extracted. For LSG, 9 of 11 studies concluded concurrent procedures to be safe and effective with no increase in mortality. Reoperation and readmission rates however were increased with HHR, whilst GORD rates were seen to improve, therefore providing a solution to the predominant issue with LSG. For LRYGB, in all 5 studies, concurrent procedures were concluded to be safe and effective, with no increase in mortality, length of stay, readmission and reoperation rates. Higher complication rates were observed compared to LSG with HHR. Among LAGB studies, all 4 studies were concluded to be safe and effective with no adverse outcomes on mortality and length of stay. GORD rates were seen to decrease, and reoperation rates from pouch dilatation and gastric prolapse were observed to significantly decrease. Concurrent HHR with MBS appears to be safe and effective. Assessment of MBS warrants the consideration of concurrent HHR depending on specific patient case and the surgeon's preference.",10.1007/s11695-023-06914-7,,,,1281
1031,Weight Loss Decreases Excess Pancreatic Triacylglycerol Specifically in Type 2 Diabetes.,"This study determined whether the decrease in pancreatic triacylglycerol during weight loss in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is simply reflective of whole-body fat or specific to diabetes and associated with the simultaneous recovery of insulin secretory function. Individuals listed for gastric bypass surgery who had T2DM or normal glucose tolerance (NGT) matched for age, weight, and sex were studied before and 8 weeks after surgery. Pancreas and liver triacylglycerol were quantified using in-phase, out-of-phase MRI. Also measured were the first-phase insulin response to a stepped intravenous glucose infusion, hepatic insulin sensitivity, and glycemic and incretin responses to a semisolid test meal. Weight loss after surgery was similar (NGT: 12.8 Â± 0.8% and T2DM: 13.6 Â± 0.7%) as was the change in fat mass (56.7 Â± 3.3 to 45.4 Â± 2.3 vs. 56.6 Â± 2.4 to 43.0 Â± 2.4 kg). Pancreatic triacylglycerol did not change in NGT (5.1 Â± 0.2 to 5.5 Â± 0.4%) but decreased in the group with T2DM (6.6 Â± 0.5 to 5.4 Â± 0.4%; P = 0.007). First-phase insulin response to a stepped intravenous glucose infusion did not change in NGT (0.24 [0.13-0.46] to 0.23 [0.19-0.37] nmol â‹… min(-1) â‹… m(-2)) but normalized in T2DM (0.08 [-0.01 to -0.10] to 0.22 [0.07-0.30]) nmol â‹… min(-1) â‹… m(-2) at week 8 (P = 0.005). No differential effect of incretin secretion was observed after gastric bypass, with more rapid glucose absorption bringing about equivalently enhanced glucagon-like peptide 1 secretion in the two groups. The fall in intrapancreatic triacylglycerol in T2DM, which occurs during weight loss, is associated with the condition itself rather than decreased total body fat.",10.2337/dc15-0750,,,,1282
84,Comparing EUS-directed Transgastric ERCP (EDGE) Versus Laparoscopic-Assisted ERCP Versus Enteroscopic ERCP: A Network Meta-analysis.,"Management of choledocholithiasis in patients with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery is challenging. This study aims to compare technical success rates, adverse events, and procedural time between 3 current approaches: endoscopic ultrasound-directed transgastric Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (EDGE), enteroscopy-assisted ERCP (E-ERCP), and laparoscopic-assisted ERCP (LA-ERCP). A systematic search of 5 databases was conducted. Direct and network meta-analyses were performed to compare interventions using the random effects model. A significance threshold of P < 0.05 was applied. Sixteen studies were included. On direct meta-analysis, technical success rates were comparable between EDGE and LA-ERCP (odds ratio: 0.768, CI: 0.196-3.006, P = 0.704, I2 = 14.13%). However, EDGE and LA-ERCP showed significantly higher success rates than E-ERCP. No significant differences in adverse events were found between EDGE versus LA-ERCP, EDGE versus E-ERCP, and LA-ERCP versus E-ERCP on direct meta-analysis. In terms of procedural time, EDGE was significantly shorter than E-ERCP [mean difference (MD): -31 minutes, 95% CI: -40.748 to -21.217, P < 0.001, I2 = 19.89%), and E-ERCP was shorter than LA-ERCP (MD: -44.567 minutes, 95% CI: -76.018 to -13.116, P = 0.005, I2 = 0%). EDGE also demonstrated a significant time advantage over LA-ERCP (MD: -78.145 minutes, 95% CI: -104.882 to -51.407, P < 0.001, I2 = 0%). All findings were consistent with network meta-analysis on random effects model. The heterogeneity of the model was low. EDGE and LA-ERCP showed superior technical success rates compared with E-ERCP. Adverse events did not significantly differ among the three approaches. Furthermore, EDGE demonstrated the shortest procedural duration. We recommend considering EDGE as a first-choice procedure.",10.1097/MCG.0000000000001949,,,,1283
331,The Influence of Mesenteric Defects Closure on the Use of Computed Tomography for Abdominal Pain 5 Years After Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass-a Post Hoc Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Abdominal pain after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is a common and unwanted complication that typically leads to further exploration through radiology. Concerns have been raised regarding the consequences of this radiation exposure and its correlation with the lifetime risk of cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in computed tomography (CT) use between LRYGB patients with open and closed mesenteric defects and to assess the radiological findings and radiation doses. This subgroup analysis included 300 patients randomized to either closure (nâ€‰=â€‰150) or nonclosure (nâ€‰=â€‰150) of mesenteric defects during LRYGB. The total number of CT scans performed due to abdominal pain in the first 5 postoperative years was recorded together with the radiological findings and radiation doses. A total of 132 patients (44%) underwent 281 abdominal CT scans, including 133 scans for 67 patients with open mesenteric defects (45%) and 148 scans for 65 patients with closed mesenteric defects (43%). Radiological findings consistent with small bowel obstruction or internal hernia were found in 31 (23%) of the scans for patients with open defects and in 18 (12%) of the scans for patients with closed defects (pâ€‰=â€‰0.014). The other pathological and radiological findings were infrequent and not significantly different between groups. At the 5-year follow-up, the total radiation dose was 82,400Â mGyÂ cm in the nonclosure group and 85,800Â mGyÂ cm in the closure group. Closure of mesenteric defects did not influence the use of CT to assess abdominal pain.",10.1007/s11695-021-05778-z,,,,1284
969,A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing partial stomach partitioning gastrojejunostomy versus conventional gastrojejunostomy for malignant gastroduodenal obstruction.,"Partial stomach partitioning gastrojejunostomy (PSPGJ) was introduced as a palliative treatment for malignant gastric outlet obstruction (MGO) caused by unresectable gastric or periampullary cancers and suggested to offer advantages over conventional gastrojejunostomy (CGJ) in reducing the risk for delayed gastric emptying (DGE). However, insufficient evidence is available to allow a comprehensive view of the true value of PSPGJ. The present study aimed to show the advantages of PSPGJ in terms of alleviating DGE and improving postoperative recovery compared to CGJ. A systematic literature search was performed, and studies comparing DGE and other perioperative and postoperative data including operation time, blood loss, total postoperative complications, anastomotic leak, postoperative period before oral intake, and/or hospital stay between PSPGJ and CGJ for MGO were incorporated. Risk ratio (RR) for binary variables and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous variables were calculated, and meta-analyses were performed. Seven studies containing 207 patients were included. The risk for DGE was significantly lower after PSPGJ (RR 0.32; 95%CI 0.17 to 0.60; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). PSPGJ significantly reduced the postoperative hospital stay (WMD -6.1Â days; 95%CI -8.9 to -3.3Â days; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). No significant differences were observed in the other variables between the groups. PSPGJ for MGO seems to offer significant advantages in terms of alleviating DGE and improving postoperative recovery compared to CGJ.",10.1007/s00423-016-1470-8,,,,1285
1114,Comparison of Virtual Nutri PlusÂ® and Dietpro 5iÂ® software systems for the assessment of nutrient intake before and after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"The assessment of nutritional intake before and after bariatric surgery assists in identifying eating disorders, nutritional deficiencies and weight loss/maintenance. The 7-day record is the gold standard for such an assessment and is interpreted using specialized software. This study sought to compare the Virtual Nutri PlusÂ® and Dietpro 5iÂ® software systems in assessing nutrient intake in obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Nutritional intake was assessed in 10 obese women with type 2 diabetes mellitus before and 3 months after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The 7-day record was used to assess food intake and then, the Virtual Nutri PlusÂ® and Dietpro 5iÂ® software systems were used to calculate calorie, macronutrient and micronutrient intake based on validated food chemical composition databases. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01251016. During the preoperative period, deficits in the ingestion of total fiber and 15 out of 22 estimated micronutrients were observed when using the Virtual Nutri PlusÂ®, compared to deficiencies in total fiber and 4 micronutrients when using the Dietpro 5iÂ®. During the postoperative period, both the Virtual Nutri PlusÂ® and Dietpro 5iÂ® systems detected deficits in the ingestion of total fiber, carbohydrates and 19 micronutrients, but only the Virtual Nutri PlusÂ® detected deficits in complex B vitamins (except B12) and minerals. Virtual Nutri PlusÂ® was more sensitive than Dietpro 5iÂ® for the identification of deficits in nutrient intake in obese, type 2 diabetes mellitus patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.",10.6061/clinics/2014(11)02,,,,1286
1334,Reduction in inflammatory gene expression in skeletal muscle from Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients randomized to omentectomy.,"To examine the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery with and without laparoscopic removal of omental fat (omentectomy) on the temporal gene expression profiles of skeletal muscle. Previously reported were the whole-body metabolic effects of a randomized, single-blinded study in patients receiving RYGB surgery stratified to receive or not receive omentectomy. In this follow up study we report on changes in skeletal muscle gene expression in a subset of 21 patients, for whom biopsies were collected preoperatively and at either 6 months or 12 months postoperatively. RNA isolated from skeletal muscle biopsies of 21 subjects (8 without omentectomy and 13 with omentectomy) taken before RYGB or at 6 and 12 months postoperatively were subjected to gene expression profiling via Exon 1.0 S/T Array and Taqman Low Density Array. Robust Multichip Analysis and gene enrichment data analysis revealed 84 genes with at least a 4-fold expression difference after surgery. At 6 and 12 months the RYGB with omentectomy group displayed a greater reduction in the expression of genes associated with skeletal muscle inflammation (ANKRD1, CDR1, CH25H, CXCL2, CX3CR1, IL8, LBP, NFIL3, SELE, SOCS3, TNFAIP3, and ZFP36) relative to the RYGB non-omentectomy group. Expressions of IL6 and CCL2 were decreased at all postoperative time points. There was differential expression of genes driving protein turnover (IGFN1, FBXW10) in both groups over time and increased expression of PAAF1 in the non-omentectomy group at 12 months. Evidence for the activation of skeletal muscle satellite cells was inferred from the up-regulation of HOXC10. The elevated post-operative expression of 22 small nucleolar RNAs and the decreased expression of the transcription factors JUNB, FOS, FOSB, ATF3 MYC, EGR1 as well as the orphan nuclear receptors NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3 suggest dramatic reorganizations at both the cellular and genetic levels. These data indicate that RYGB reduces skeletal muscle inflammation, and removal of omental fat further amplifies this response. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00212160.",10.1371/journal.pone.0028577,,,,1287
702,Insulin Clearance After Oral and Intravenous Glucose Following Gastric Bypass and Gastric Banding Weight Loss.,"Hepatic insulin clearance is a significant regulator of glucose homestasis. We hypothesized that the improvement in insulin clearance rates (ICRs) under fasting conditions and in response to oral and intravenous (IV) glucose would improve similarly after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and adjustable gastric banding (AGB) as a function of weight loss; the difference in ICR after oral and IV glucose stimulation will be enhanced after RYGB compared with AGB, an effect mediated by glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). In study 1, the ICR was calculated under fasting condition (F-ICR), after oral glucose (O-ICR), and after an isoglycemic IV glucose clamp (IV-ICR) in individuals from an established cohort with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) before, after 10% matched weight loss, and 1 year after either RYGB (n = 22) or AGB (n = 12). In study 2, O-ICR was studied in a separate cohort of individuals with T2DM (n = 22), before and 3 months after RYGB, with and without exendin(9-39) infusion. In study 1, age, BMI, T2DM duration and control, and ICR did not differ between RYGB and AGB preintervention. Weight loss at 1 year was two times greater after RYGB than after AGB (31.6 Â± 5.9% vs. 16.6 Â± 9.8%; P < 0.05). RYGB and AGB both significantly increased F-ICR, O-ICR, and IV-ICR at 1 year. ICR was inversely associated with insulinemia. The difference between IV-ICR and O-ICR was significantly greater after RYGB versus AGB. GLP-1 antagonism with exendin(9-39) led to an increase in O-ICR in subjects post-RYGB. Weight loss increased ICR, an effect more pronounced after RYGB compared with AGB. Our data support a potential role for endogenous GLP-1 in the control of postprandial ICR after RYGB.",10.2337/dc18-1036,,,,1288
693,Platelet Functions are Decreased in Obesity and Restored after Weight Loss: Evidence for a Role of the SERCA3-Dependent ADP Secretion Pathway.,"In obesity, platelets are described as hyperactive, mainly based on increased platelet size and presence of pro-thrombotic plasmatic molecules. We explored platelet functions, including calcium signalling in obesity, and the effect of weight loss. We included 40 obese patients (women with body mass index [BMI] of â‰¥ 35 kg/m2) who were to undergo gastric bypass surgery and 40 healthy lean subjects (women with BMI ofâ€‰<â€‰25 kg/m2) as a control group. Approximately 1â€‰year after surgery, the obese patients lost weight (75% had a BMIâ€‰<â€‰35 kg/m2). They were explored a second time with the same healthy control for the same platelet experiments. Compared with controls, obese patients' platelets displayed reduced sensitivity to thrombin (aggregation EC50 increased by 1.9â€‰Â±â€‰0.3-fold, pâ€‰=â€‰0.005) and a lower Ca2+ response (70â€‰Â±â€‰7% decrease, pâ€‰<â€‰10-4). In 17 pairs of patients, we performed additional experiments: in obese patients' platelets, thrombin-induced Î±IIbÎ²3 activation was significantly lower (pâ€‰=â€‰0.003) and sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPase (SERCA3) expression was decreased (48â€‰Â±â€‰6% decrease, pâ€‰<â€‰10-4). These differences were abolished after weight loss. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of SERCA3 activity in control group's platelets mimicked similar alterations than in obese patients' platelets and was associated with defective adenosine diphosphate (ADP) secretion. Addition of ADP to agonist restored platelet functions in obese patients and in SERCA3-inhibited control platelets (five experiments) confirming the direct involvement of the SERCA3-dependent ADP secretion pathway. This is the first study demonstrating that platelets from obese patients are hypo-reactive, due to a deficiency of SERCA3-dependent ADP secretion. Weight loss restores SERCA3 activity and subsequent calcium signalling, Î±IIbÎ²3 activation, platelet aggregation and ADP secretion.",10.1055/s-0038-1677033,,,,1289
285,"Dasiglucagon Effectively Mitigates Postbariatric Postprandial Hypoglycemia: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Crossover Trial.","To investigate the efficacy and safety of dasiglucagon, a novel stable glucagon analog in a liquid formulation, in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)-operated individuals suffering from postbariatric hypoglycemia (PBH). In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, 10 RYGB-operated participants with continuous glucose monitoring-verified PBH were randomly assigned to 3 trial days, each consisting of a 240-min standardized liquid mixed-meal test with the subcutaneous injection of placebo or 80 Î¼g or 200 Î¼g dasiglucagon. Compared with placebo, treatment with both 80 and 200 Î¼g dasiglucagon raised nadir plasma glucose (PG) (placebo: 3.0 Â± 0.2 mmol/L [mean Â± SEM]; 80 Î¼g dasiglucagon: 3.9 Â± 0.3 mmol/L, P = 0.002; 200 Î¼g dasiglucagon: 4.5 Â± 0.2 mmol/L, P = 0.0002) and reduced time in hypoglycemia (PG <3.9 mmol/L) by 70.0 min (P = 0.030 and P = 0.008).

447,Differences in the effects of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on gut hormones: systematic and meta-analysis.,"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) procedures are becoming more popular in the world of bariatric surgery. This study investigates how LSG and LRYGB affect gut hormones and examines their differences. Systematic review and meta-analysis. The literature was retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library database before AprilÂ 2020. We included 53 articles in our meta-analysis. After bariatric surgery, the patients' ghrelin, fasting acyl-ghrelin, fasting peptide YY (PYY), and their AUC in the LSG group were significantly lower than those in LRYGB group. Fasting ghrelin levels were significantly reduced in patients who received LSG. After LRYGB, the postoperative fasting PYY was higher than at baseline, and the results were statistically significant. Additionally, we found an increase in fasting ghrelin levels after LRYGB. Lastly, insulin levels were both reduced after LSG and LRYGB with no significant difference. In terms of gut hormones, ghrelin decreased significantly after LSG, while PYY increased after LRYGB. However, the impacts caused by the change in gut hormones after undergoing either LSG and LRYGB on patients are complicated, therefore, the results should be interpreted cautiously.",10.1016/j.soard.2020.10.018,,,,1291
1522,"Intragastric balloon reduces liver volume in super-obese patients, facilitating subsequent laparoscopic gastric bypass.","Surgery in patients with super-obesity (BMI > or = 50) involves technical difficulties that are related, among other factors, to increased liver volume. Although the intragastric balloon is not a definitive alternative to surgery, it has been used in these patients as a primary therapeutic means of reducing excess weight and the risks of subsequent surgery. It has also been reported to considerably diminish liver volume to facilitate technical aspects of the operation. We evaluated preoperative weight loss in patients with super-obesity after placement of an intragastric balloon and its effect on liver volume measured by computed axial tomography (CT) prior to laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP). The balloon was implanted preoperatively under endoscopic guidance and sedation in 31 patients with super-obesity, to reduce weight prior to LRYGBP. Two patients were excluded from the study for intolerance and the balloon was removed 2 weeks after placement. Measurement of liver volume was done with axial images obtained by spiral CT with a section thickness of 10 mm, reconstitution index 10 mm, pitch 1.5 and acquisition delay 60 seconds. Volumes were calculated using the sum of areas technique. Measurement of volume was done in these 29 patients prior to balloon placement and the week before surgery. After placement of the balloon, 27 patients (93%) had nausea and 25 patients (86%) had vomiting, which abated 1 week after placement. Mean liver volume prior to balloon placement was 2938.53 +/- 853.1 cm3, which at 6 weeks dropped to values of 1918.2 +/- 499.8 cm3, revealing a considerable reduction in liver volume [31.8% +/- 18.16% (range 3.1%-58.5%)]. Percent of excess weight loss was 22.14% +/- 7.39. LRYGBP was performed at 6 months. In patients with super-obesity, preoperative treatment with intragastric balloon considerably reduces liver volume to facilitate LRYGBP.",10.1007/s11695-007-9040-3,,,,1292

282,Factors associated with adherence to ursodeoxycholic acid or placebo in patients after bariatric surgery.,"Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) reduces symptomatic gallstone disease after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The beneficial effect of UDCA is reduced by poor adherence. We aimed to identify factors associated with poor adherence to UDCA or placebo after bariatric surgery. Outpatient clinic and department for bariatric surgery in three hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients in the multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled UPGRADE trial were assessed for adherence to 900 mg UDCA or placebo for 6 months through a pill count, inquiries during follow-up, and a questionnaire. Poor adherence was defined as the usage of <300 of 364 pills within a maximum of 8 months postoperatively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors contributing to poor adherence. In total, 967 patients were included (mean age [standard deviation (SD)]: 45.1 [11.1] years; female: 772 [80%]; RYGB: 889 [92%]; sleeve gastrectomy: 78 [8%]), of whom 357 (37%) were poor adherers. Factors associated with poor adherence were age (OR .97; 95% confidence interval [CI] .96-.98, a decrease in age increases the odds for poor adherence), foreign origin (odds ratio [OR] 2.07; 95%CI 1.50-2.84), unemployment (OR 1.73; 95%CI 1.28-2.34), and sleeve gastrectomy (OR 1.79; 95%CI 1.06-3.01). Furthermore, a difference in adherence status was also noted for the centers of surgery. The adherence rate to UDCA and placebo in the UPGRADE trial was suboptimal. Several factors were independently associated with poor adherence. Our findings can help to identify patients who may benefit from extra guidance to improve adherence.",10.1016/j.soard.2022.02.010,,,,1294
1612,The use of polypropylene mesh in midline incision closure following gastric by-pass surgery reduces the risk of postoperative hernia.,"Incisional hernia is a common problem following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity. We report the preliminary results of nonrandomized prophylactic use of polypropylene mesh in a group of 60 consecutive patients. The patients with highest body mass index, and/or history of abdominal hernias and profound liver damage had abdominal wall reinforced with mesh during an operation. A year later the wound was assessed in all patients. In standard wound closure group (n=48) incisional hernia was found in 9 cases (20%). None of the patients with inserted mesh (n=12) developed hernia. The length of hospital stay in mesh group was similar to that in the nonmesh group and shorter than in patients with hernia occurrence. Mesh insertion was complicated with wound discharge in three patients. In our opinion prophylactic use of polypropylene mesh in bariatric patients is highly effective in postoperative hernia prevention.",10.1007/s00423-002-0325-7,,,,1295
139,Nutritional strategies for correcting low glucose values in patients with postbariatric hypoglycaemia: A randomized controlled three-arm crossover trial.,"To evaluate the efficacy of nutritional hypoglycaemia correction strategies in postbariatric hypoglycaemia (PBH) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). In a randomized, controlled, three-arm crossover trial, eight post-RYGB adults (mean [SD] 7.0 [1.4] years since surgery) with PBH ingested a solid mixed meal (584â€‰kcal, 85â€‰g carbohydrates, 21â€‰g fat, 12â€‰g protein) to induce hypoglycaemia on three separate days. Upon reaching plasma glucose of less than 3.0â€‰mmol/L, hypoglycaemia was corrected with 15â€‰g of glucose (G15), 5â€‰g of glucose (G5) or a protein bar (P10, 10â€‰g of protein) in random order. The primary outcome was percentage of time spent in the target plasma glucose range (3.9-5.5â€‰mmol/L) during 40â€‰minutes after correction. Postcorrection time spent in the target glucose range did not differ significantly between the interventions (Pâ€‰=â€‰.161). However, postcorrection time with glucose less than 3.9â€‰mmol/L was lower after G15 than P10 (Pâ€‰=â€‰.007), whereas time spent with glucose more than 5.5â€‰mmol/L, peak glucose and insulin 15â€‰minutes postcorrection were higher after G15 than G5 and P10 (Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). Glucagon 15â€‰minutes postcorrection was higher after P10 than after G15 and G5 (Pâ€‰=â€‰.002 and Pâ€‰=â€‰.003, respectively). G15 resulted in rebound hypoglycaemia (<â€‰3.0â€‰mmol/L) in three of eight cases (38%), while no rebound hypoglycaemia occurred with G5 and P10. Correcting hypoglycaemia with 15â€‰g of glucose should be reconsidered in post-RYGB PBH. A lower dose appears to sufficiently increase glucose levels outside the critical range in most cases, and complementary nutrients (e.g. proteins) may provide glycaemia-stabilizing benefits.

322,Metabolite Changes After Metabolic Surgery - Associations to Parameters Reflecting Glucose Homeostasis and Lipid Levels.,"To test the hypothesis that adipose tissue gene expression patterns would be affected by metabolic surgery and we aimed to identify genes and metabolic pathways as well as metabolites correlating with metabolic changes following metabolic surgery. This observational study was conducted at the Obesity Unit at the Catholic University Hospital of the Sacred Heart in Rome, Italy. Fifteen patients, of which six patients underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and nine patients underwent biliopancreatic diversion, were included. The participants underwent an oral glucose tolerance test and a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Small polar metabolites were analyzed with a two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCÃ—GC-TOFMS). Gene expression analysis of genes related to metabolism of amino acids and fatty acids were analyzed in subcutaneous adipose tissue. All procedures were performed at study start and at follow-up (after 185.3 Â± 72.9 days). Twelve metabolites were significantly changed after metabolic surgery. Six metabolites were identified as 3-indoleacetic acid, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, valine, glutamic acid, 4-hydroxybenzeneacetic acid and alpha-tocopherol. The branched chain amino acids displayed a significant decrease together with a decrease in BCAT1 adipose tissue mRNA levels. Changes in the identified metabolites were associated to changes in lipid, insulin and glucose levels. Our study has identified metabolites and metabolic pathways that are altered by metabolic surgery and may be used as biomarkers for metabolic improvement.",10.3389/fendo.2021.786952,,,,1297

359,The Metabolomic Effects of Tripeptide Gut Hormone Infusion Compared to Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Caloric Restriction.,"The gut-derived peptide hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), oxyntomodulin (OXM), and peptide YY (PYY) are regulators of energy intake and glucose homeostasis and are thought to contribute to the glucose-lowering effects of bariatric surgery. To establish the metabolomic effects of a combined infusion of GLP-1, OXM, and PYY (tripeptide GOP) in comparison to a placebo infusion, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, and a very low-calorie diet (VLCD). Subanalysis of a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of GOP infusion (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01945840), including VLCD and RYGB comparator groups. Twenty-five obese patients with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes were randomly allocated to receive a 4-week subcutaneous infusion of GOP (n = 14) or 0.9% saline control (n = 11). An additional 22 patients followed a VLCD, and 21 underwent RYGB surgery. Plasma and urine samples collected at baseline and 4 weeks into each intervention were subjected to cross-platform metabolomic analysis, followed by unsupervised and supervised modeling approaches to identify similarities and differences between the effects of each intervention. Aside from glucose, very few metabolites were affected by GOP, contrasting with major metabolomic changes seen with VLCD and RYGB. Treatment with GOP provides a powerful glucose-lowering effect but does not replicate the broader metabolomic changes seen with VLCD and RYGB. The contribution of these metabolomic changes to the clinical benefits of RYGB remains to be elucidated.",10.1210/clinem/dgab608,,,,1299
1307,Hematological variables and iron status in abdominoplasty after bariatric surgery.,"Abdominoplasty, the treatment for abdominal wall deformity stemming from weight loss after bariatric surgery, can cause postoperative anemia. Moreover, bariatric surgery has been associated with iron deficiency, which by itself can compromise erythropoiesis. The objective of this research is to describe the development of anemia after postbariatric abdominoplasty. The study group consisted of 32 adult women who had received bariatric surgery. Treatment group included 20 patients who were undergoing postbariatric abdominoplasty. Control group included 12 patients waiting for abdominoplasty. Values of hemoglobin, reticulocytes, iron, ferritin, and the transferrin saturation were obtained on the evening before abdominoplasty and during the first, fourth, and eighth postoperative weeks. Hemoglobin was measured at 48 h. Mean hemoglobin levels for treatment group decreased from 12.98 to 10.8 g/dL after 48 h, increased on day 7 to 11.53 g/dL, but did not increase further after day 7. The reticulocyte number increased in the first week. Serum iron and transferrin saturation index fell during the first week and remained low. Ferritin levels increased non-significantly from 29.77 to 37.24 ng/mL at week 1, then fell until they were decreased (16.44 ng/mL) by day 56. As expected, hemoglobin fell after abdominoplasty. However, after a one-third recovery of hemoglobin concentrations by week 1 postoperative, they failed to return to preoperative levels by the eighth week. Additionally, by the eighth postoperative week, 45 % of abdominoplasty patients had developed an iron deficiency and hemoglobin deficit that was higher than that of patients who maintained normal iron stocks.",10.1007/s11695-012-0720-2,,,,1300
976,"Changes in problematic and disordered eating after gastric bypass, adjustable gastric banding and vertical sleeve gastrectomy: a systematic review of pre-post studies.","Despite differences in their mechanisms and outcomes, little is known about whether postsurgical changes in eating behaviours also differ by bariatric procedure. Following a systematic search, 23 studies on changes in binge eating disorder (BED) and related behaviours, bulimia nervosa and related behaviours, night eating syndrome, grazing and emotional eating after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), adjustable gastric banding (AGB) and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) were reviewed. Significant methodological problems and a dearth of literature regarding many behaviours and VSG were seen. Regarding BED and related behaviours, although later re-increases were noted, short to medium-term reductions after RYGB were common, and reported changes after AGB were inconsistent. Short to medium-term reductions in emotional eating, and from a few studies, short to long-term reductions in bulimic symptoms, were reported after RYGB. Reoccurrences and new occurrences of problem and disordered eating, especially BED and binge episodes, were apparent after RYGB and AGB. Further conclusions and comparisons could not be made because of limited or low-quality evidence. Long-term comparison studies of changes to problematic and disordered eating in RYGB, AGB and VSG patients are needed. It is currently unclear whether any bariatric procedure leads to long-term improvement of any problematic or disordered eating behaviours.",10.1111/obr.12425,,,,1301
515,Metoclopramide Reduces Fluoroscopy and Procedure Time during Gastrojejunostomy Tube Placement: A Placebo-Controlled Trial.,"To determine whether a single 10-mg intravenous dose of the promotility agent metoclopramide reduces the fluoroscopy time, radiation dose, and procedure time required for gastrojejunostomy (GJ) tube placement. This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled consecutive patients who underwent primary GJ tube placement at a single institution from April 10, 2018, to October 3, 2019. Exclusion criteria included age less than 18 years, inability to obtain consent, metoclopramide allergy or contraindication, and altered pyloric anatomy. Average fluoroscopy times, radiation doses, and procedure times were compared using t-tests. The full study protocol can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03331965). Of 110 participants randomized 1:1, 45 received metoclopramide and 51 received placebo and underwent GJ tube placement (38 females and 58 males; mean age, 55 Â± 18 years). Demographics of the metoclopramide and placebo groups were similar. The fluoroscopy time required to advance a guide wire through the pylorus averaged 1.6 minutes (range, 0.3-10.1 minutes) in the metoclopramide group versus 4.1 minutes (range, 0.2-27.3 minutes) in the placebo group (PÂ = .002). Total procedure fluoroscopy time averaged 5.8 minutes (range, 1.5-16.2 minutes) for the metoclopramide group versus 8.8 minutes (range, 2.8-29.7 minutes) for the placebo group (P = .002). Air kerma averaged 91 mGy (range, 13-354 mGy) for the metoclopramide group versus 130 mGy (range, 24-525 mGy) for the placebo group (P = .04). Total procedure time averaged 16.4 minutes (range, 8-51 minutes) for the metoclopramide group versus 19.9 minutes (range, 6-53 minutes) for the placebo group (PÂ = .04). There were no drug-related adverse events and no significant differences in procedure-related complications. A single dose of metoclopramide reduced fluoroscopy time by 34%, radiation dose by 30%, and procedure time by 17% during GJ tube placement.",10.1016/j.jvir.2020.02.028,,,,1302
906,Perioperative Analgesia for Fast-Track Laparoscopic Bariatric Surgery.,"Postoperative pain and analgesia present challenges in bariatric surgery patients. Multimodal analgesia may provide better efficacy, less complications and expedite fast-track bariatric surgical care. There are no studies of the broader topic of perioperative analgesia and the overall impact. This study highlights the impact of multimodal intraoperative analgesia on fast-track bariatric surgery. This observational study examined the perioperative outcome data of 412 consecutive laparoscopic bariatric surgery patients over a 6-year period. Perioperative outcome and variables were analysed and compared between different intraoperative analgesia types. Mean BMI was 49, mean age was 42 and male:female ratio was 1:4. About 82% of patients received multimodal intraoperative analgesia, comprising various combinations of bupivacaine infiltration and intravenous acetaminophen, morphine, tramadol, parecoxib or diclofenac. Morphine was administered in 83% of patients and tramadol in 17%. Multimodal intraoperative analgesia provided better postoperative analgesia, shorter postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) duration, lower postoperative opioid requirement, less postoperative vomiting, earlier postoperative oral intake, earlier ambulation and shorter hospital stay compared to unimodal intraoperative morphine analgesia (pÂ =Â 0.0001). Multimodal analgesia comprising tramadol + acetaminophen + diclofenac provided better postoperative analgesia, shorter PACU duration, lower postoperative opioid requirement, earlier ambulation, shorter hospital stay and less postoperative hypopnoea compared to patients who received morphine (pÂ =Â 0.0001). Multimodal intraoperative analgesia provides better postoperative analgesia, less complications and better perioperative outcomes and facilitates fast-track bariatric surgical care. Tramadol is suitable, efficacious and safe and associated with the best perioperative outcomes in bariatric surgery patients.",10.1007/s11695-017-2562-4,,,,1303
534,The effect of acute dual SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibition on incretin release and glucose metabolism after gastric bypass surgery.,"Enhanced meal-related enteroendocrine secretion, particularly of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), contributes to weight-loss and improved glycemia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Dietary glucose drives GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) secretion postoperatively. Understanding how glucose triggers incretin secretion following RYGB could lead to new treatments of diabetes and obesity. In vitro, incretin release depends on glucose absorption via sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1). We investigated the importance of SGLT1/SGLT2 for enteropancreatic hormone concentrations and glucose metabolism after RYGB in a randomized, controlled, crossover study. Ten RYGB-operated patients ingested 50 g of oral glucose with and without acute pretreatment with 600 mg of the SGLT1/SGLT2-inhibitor canagliflozin. Paracetamol and 3-O-methyl-d-glucopyranose (3-OMG) were added to the glucose drink to evaluate rates of intestinal entry and absorption of glucose, respectively. Blood samples were collected for 4 h. The primary outcome was 4-h plasma GLP-1 (incremental area-under the curve, iAUC). Secondary outcomes included glucose, GIP, insulin, and glucagon. Canagliflozin delayed glucose absorption (time-to-peak 3-OMG: 50 vs. 132 min, P < 0.01) but did not reduce iAUC GLP-1 (6,067 vs. 7,273Â·minÂ·pmol-1Â·L-1, P = 0.23), although peak GLP-1 concentrations were lowered (-28%, P = 0.03). Canagliflozin reduced GIP (iAUC -28%, P = 0.01; peak concentrations -57%, P < 0.01), insulin, and glucose excursions, whereas plasma glucagon (AUC 3,216 vs. 4,160 minÂ·pmolÂ·L-1, P = 0.02) and amino acids were increased. In conclusion, acute SGLT1/SGLT2-inhibition during glucose ingestion did not reduce 4-h plasma GLP-1 responses in RYGB-patients but attenuated the early rise in GLP-1, GIP, and insulin, whereas late glucagon concentrations were increased. The results suggest that SGLT1-mediated glucose absorption contributes to incretin hormone secretion after RYGB.",10.1152/ajpendo.00023.2020,,,,1304
1305,Usefulness of acarbose and dietary modifications to limit glycemic variability following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass as assessed by continuous glucose monitoring.,"About 70% of the patients operated on for a gastric bypass (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [RYGB]) suffer from dumping syndrome. In these patients, previous studies have demonstrated a high glycemic variability with hypoglycemia and with altered continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) profiles. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of treatment with dietary counseling plus acarbose administration on the symptoms and on the characteristics of the CGM profile. Eight consecutive patients with dumping syndrome were given dietary counseling for 6 weeks and also treated with acarbose (50-100â€‰mg three times a day). Their symptoms and the features of the CGM were compared before and after treatment. The symptoms disappeared in seven patients. There was a significant increase in the time to the interstitial glucose (IG) peak and a reduction in the rate of the IG increase after a meal and in the rate of the IG decrease following the peak. The time below 60â€‰mg/dL was significantly decreased, and the minimal IG value was significantly increased. The maximum and mean IG levels and the time above 140â€‰mg/dL were decreased, but not significantly. Six patients spent more than 1% of the time with IG values below 60â€‰mg/dL before treatment, but after treatment this was reduced to one patient. Before treatment only one patient had an IG level neither below 60 or above 140â€‰mg/dL, and after treatment four patients were in this category. Dietary counseling and acarbose treatment eliminated the symptoms and improved the CGM profile of patients suffering from dumping syndrome after RYGB.",10.1089/dia.2011.0302,,,,1305
225,Outcomes of same-day discharge sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Length of stay after bariatric surgery has progressively shortened. Same-day discharge (SDD) has been reported for the 2 most common bariatric procedures, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and success of SDD following SG and RYGB. Systematic literature search on SDD after bariatric surgery was conducted in Medline, Cochrane library, Google Scholar, and Embase. SDD was defined as discharging the patient during the day of the bariatric operation, without an overnight stay. The primary outcomes of interest were successful SDD, readmission, and morbidity rates. The secondary endpoints included reoperation and mortality rates. A proportion meta-analysis was performed to assess the outcomes of interest. A total of 14 studies with 33,403 patients who underwent SDD SG (32,165) or RYGB (1238) were included in the qualitative synthesis. Seven studies with 5000 patients who underwent SDD SG were included in the quantitative analysis, and pooled proportions (PPs) were calculated for the outcomes of interest. The SDD success rate was 63%-100% (PP: 99%) after SG and 88%-98.1% after RYGB. The readmission rate ranged from .6% to 20.8% (PP: 4%) after SDD SG and 2.4%-4% after SDD RYGB. Overall morbidity, reoperation, and mortality were 1.1%-10% (PP:4%), .3%-2.1% (PP: 1%), and 0%-.1% (PP: 0%), respectively, for SDD SG, and 2.5%-4%,1.9%-2.5%, and 0%-.9%, respectively, for SDD RYGB. SDD after SG seems feasible and safe. The outcomes of SDDRYGB seem promising, but the evidenceis stilllimitedto draw definitive conclusions. Selection criteria and perioperative protocolsmust be standardized to adequately introduce this practice.",10.1016/j.soard.2022.09.004,,,,1306
627,Investigating Intestinal Glucagon After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery.,"After Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, postprandial plasma glucagon concentrations have been reported to increase. This occurs despite concomitant improved glucose tolerance and increased circulating plasma concentrations of insulin and the glucagon-inhibiting hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). To investigate whether RYGB-induced hyperglucagonemia may be derived from the gut. Substudy of a prospective cross-sectional study at a university hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. Morbidly obese individuals undergoing RYGB (n = 8) with or without type 2 diabetes. Three months before and after RYGB, participants underwent upper enteroscopy with retrieval of gastrointestinal mucosal biopsy specimens. Mixed-meal tests were performed 1 week and 3 months before and after RYGB. The 29-amino acid glucagon concentrations in plasma and in mucosal gastrointestinal biopsy specimens were assessed using mass spectrometry-validated immunoassays, and a new monoclonal antibody reacting with immunoreactive glucagon was used for immunohistochemistry. Postprandial plasma concentrations of glucagon after RYGB were increased. Expression of the glucagon gene in the small intestine increased after surgery. Glucagon was identified in the small-intestine biopsy specimens obtained after, but not before, RYGB. Immunohistochemically, mucosal biopsy specimens from the small intestine harbored cells costained for GLP-1 and immunoreactive glucagon. Increased concentrations of glucagon were observed in small-intestine biopsy specimens and postprandially in plasma after RYGB. The small intestine harbored cells immunohistochemically costaining for GLP-1 and glucagon-like immunoreactivity after RYGB.

1225,Weight-reducing gastroplasty with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: impact on vitamin D status and bone remodeling markers.,"Despite the weight loss benefits of bariatric surgery, studies have shown considerably compromised nutritional conditions, particularly in relation to bone metabolism, in patients who have undergone this procedure. The goal of this study was evaluate bone metabolism alterations after gastroplasty through the concentrations of carboxy-terminal cross-linking telopeptides of type-I collagen (CTX) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) and vitamin D status. This study, conducted at the Botucatu School of Medicine University Hospital, UNESP, analyzed 22 women with body mass index (BMI) values higher than 35â€‰kg/m(2) who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, prior to and 3 and 6 months after the procedure. The patients were evaluated in relation to their anthropometric profile. Obese patients showed a vitamin D status that was compatible with moderate depletion, thus correlating negatively with parathyroid hormone (PTH) and positively with CTX. After surgery, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and CTX concentrations increased significantly. Other tests (calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total AP and BSAP, and PTH) did not differ between the times of analysis and remained stable within the range of normality. Body fat correlated only with 25(OH)D concentrations and was inversely proportional to their increase. There was a positive correlation between PTH and CTX prior to surgery. Hypovitaminosis D is prevalent in obese individuals, and RYGB is related to CTX increase without BSAP alteration in the first follow-up semester.",10.1089/met.2013.0026,,,,1308
1097,Meta-analysis of internal herniation after gastric bypass surgery.,"The aim of this study was to provide a systematic and quantitative summary of the association between laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and the reported incidence of internal herniation (IH). The route of the Roux limb and closure of mesenteric and/or mesocolonic defects are described as factors of influence. MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched for relevant literature, references and citations according to the PRISMA statement. Two independent reviewers selected studies that evaluated incidence of IH after LRYGB and possible techniques for prevention. Data were pooled by route of the Roux limb and closure/non-closure of the mesenteric and/or mesocolonic defects. Forty-five articles included data on 31â€‰320 patients. Lowest IH incidence was in the antecolic group, with closure of all defects (1 per cent; Pâ€‰<â€‰0Â·001), followed by the antecolic group, with all defects left open and the retrocolic group with closure of the mesenteric and mesocolonic defect (both 2 per cent; Pâ€‰<â€‰0Â·001). The incidence of IH was highest in the antecolic group, with closure of the jejunal defect, and in the retrocolic group, with closure of all defects (both 3 per cent). The present systematic review includes a random-effects meta-analysis. The antecolic procedure, with closure of both the mesenteric and Petersen defects, has the lowest internal herniation incidence following laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.",10.1002/bjs.9738,,,,1309
1202,Association of adipose tissue and liver fibrosis with tissue stiffness in morbid obesity: links with diabetes and BMI loss after gastric bypass.,"Liver and white adipose tissue (WAT) develop inflammation and fibrosis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the bioclinical relevance of WAT fibrosis in morbid obesity and diabetes and the relationships with tissue stiffness measured using a novel device. Observational and longitudinal studies were conducted in a hospital nutrition department. Biopsies of liver and subcutaneous WAT (scWAT) and omental adipose tissue were collected from 404 obese bariatric surgery candidates, of whom 243 were clinically characterized before surgery and 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. In 123 subjects, liver and scWAT stiffness was assessed noninvasively using vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE). Bariatric surgery was performed for some patients. Adipose tissue fibrosis and stiffness and their link to obesity phenotypes were measured. scWAT fibrosis was positively associated with liver fibrosis (fibrosis score â‰¥2) (Ï±= 0.14; P = .01). VCTE-evaluated liver and scWAT stiffness was positively correlated with immunohistochemistry-determined liver (Ï±= 0.46; P = .0009) and scWAT fibrosis (Ï±= 0.48; P = .0001). VCTE-evaluated scWAT stiffness measures negatively associated with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry-evaluated body fat mass (R = -0.25; P = .009) and were correlated with metabolic variables. Diabetic subjects showed increased scWAT stiffness. Participants less responsive to gastric bypass were older and more frequently diabetic, and they had increased body mass index, serum IL-6, and scWAT and liver fibrosis. Subjects with no diabetes and normal liver had higher fat mass and lower tissue fibrosis and stiffness. scWAT stiffness was associated with tissue fibrosis, obesity, and diabetes-related traits. Noninvasive evaluation of scWAT stiffness might be useful in clinical practice.",10.1210/jc.2013-3253,,,,1310
1116,Non-radical resection versus bypass procedure for pancreatic cancer - a consecutive series and systematic review.,"Most survival studies comparing non-radical resections to bypass surgery in patients with pancreatic cancer often do not differentiate between an R1 and R2 resection. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether non-radical R1 and R2 resections have better postoperative outcomes and survival compared to a palliative bypass. A single center cohort study was performed analyzing mortality, morbidity and 1-year survival after R1 (tumor cells within 1Â mm from the circumferential margin), R2 and bypass surgery in patients with pancreatic cancer. For the systematic review, studies were identified comparing R1 or R2 resections with bypass, in patients with pancreatic cancer. Postoperative outcomes were compared including the cohort study. The cohort study (n=405) showed higher morbidity rates after R1 (n=191) and R2 (n=11) resections compared to bypass (52% and 73% vs. 34%, pÂ <Â 0.01). In-hospital mortality did not differ (overall 1.7%). 1-year survival rates were 71%, 46% and 32% after R1, R2 resection and bypass (p=0.6 between R2 and bypass). The systematic review identified 8 studies, after including the cohort study 1535 patients were analyzed. Increased morbidity after R1-R2 resection (48%) compared to bypass (30-34%) was found. Median survival was 14-18 months after R1 resection vs. 9-13 months after bypass and 8.5-11.5 months after R2 resection vs. 7.5-10.7 months after bypass. An R2 resection should be avoided in patients with pancreatic cancer due to its poor prognosis. Survival benefit after an R1 resection, as compared to bypass surgery, justifies a resection despite the increased morbidity rate.",10.1016/j.ejso.2014.11.041,,,,1311
1268,Management of iron deficiency and anemia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery: an observational study.,"Iron deficiency (ID) is common after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB). Optimal iron management in this population is unclear. The objective of this study was to assess our management of RYGB patients with ID and anemia. Clinic visit records of RYGB patients with ID or anemia from January 1, 2008, to February 1, 2010 were evaluated. Demographic characteristics, postsurgery iron and anemia indices, and prescribed treatments were recorded. Three separate definitions for ID and anemia were used (standard textbook, ASBMS, and recent literature). An intravenous iron protocol was later implemented, and follow-up laboratory values were obtained. A total of 125 with ID or anemia (89% female, 86% Caucasian), mean (SD) age 44.7 (8.6) years, and BMI 47.3 (10.8) kg/m(2) at time of RYGB, were included. Proportion of values meeting criteria for ID or anemia at first follow-up: standard textbook, hemoglobin (Hb, 35%), transferrin saturation (Tsat, 48%), ferritin (28%); ASBMS, ferritin (43%); recent literature, ferritin (58%), serum iron (21%). At mean follow-up of 45.7 (43) months, oral iron (n = 49) or intravenous iron (n = 4) had been prescribed for 53 (42.4%) patients, and 32 (25.6%) patients received multiple blood transfusions. Nine patients received intravenous iron using the new protocol (400-1400 mg), resulting in increases in Hb (1.8 g/dL; P<.05) and ferritin (31.8 ng/mL; P< .002). Iron management was inadequate. Hematologic values often were deficient for sustained periods. Initially, few patients received intravenous iron after oral iron failure, many received no iron supplementation, and there was high use of blood transfusions. Subsequently, administration of intravenous iron was beneficial.",10.1016/j.soard.2013.01.019,,,,1312
872,"Effect of a randomised 12-week resistance training programme on muscular strength, cross-sectional area and muscle quality in women having undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.","The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a 12-week resistance training programme on fat-free mass (FFM), muscle cross-sectional area, muscular strength and muscle quality in women who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. Participants were 16 women (mean ageÂ =Â 44.9Â Â±Â 10.2Â years) from bariatric surgical groups who were randomly assigned into either a control or an intervention group. Air displacement plethysmography measured FFM and magnetic resonance imaging measured quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area and whole thigh muscle cross-sectional area. Muscular strength and quality was assessed using an estimated 1-Repetition Maximum assessment. All measurements were collected twice, at baseline and at a 12-week follow-up. There were significantly greater improvements in leg press strength (mean differencesÂ =Â 55.4%, PÂ <Â 0.001, Cohen's dÂ =Â 2.4), leg extension strength (mean differencesÂ =Â 18.0%, PÂ =Â 0.014, Cohen's dÂ =Â 0.86) and leg press muscle quality (mean differencesÂ =Â 54.5%, PÂ <Â 0.001, Cohen's dÂ =Â 1.9) in the intervention group compared to the control group following the resistance training programme. The resistance training intervention significantly improved muscular strength and quality; however, it did not illicit changes in FFM or muscle cross-sectional area in women who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.",10.1080/02640414.2017.1322217,,,,1313
318,Vitamin B Complex Deficiency After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy-a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Bariatric surgery, although an effective method, still has complications, like nutritional deficiencies. Our aim was to summarize the evidence on the frequency of complex B vitamin deficiencies in studies comparing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). We included 25 studies for qualitative synthesis and 21 studies for quantitative synthesis. Relevant data was extracted, including proportion of patients with deficiency and mean serum vitamin values in 3 different timeframes. B12 and folate were the most prevalent deficiencies. B12 deficiency was more common after RYGB and folate serum mean levels were higher after RYGB. SG causes less nutrient deficiency and is therefore a better technique from this point of view. More studies are needed on B2, B3, and B6 vitamins to draw better conclusions.",10.1007/s11695-021-05783-2,,,,1314
378,Characteristics of Patients Reporting Presumed Problematic Drinking Behavior After Gastric Bypass: Exploring Long-Term Data From the BAROBS Study.,"To explore patients' long-term experiences with drinking alcohol after Roux-n-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) for conceptualizing what may indicate problematic drinking behavior after bariatric surgery. Three-center, observational study. 546 adult patients undergoing RYGB in the period 2003-2009 in Norway. Self-reported data on drinking behavior and experiences related to alcohol collected 10-15 years after surgery. Out of the 959 patients undergoing RYGB in the period, 29 were diseased and 546 participated in this follow-up study (58.7%). Focusing on suspicious changes in drinking behavior, 8.8% reported drinking more, 11.5% consumed alcohol at least twice a week, and 10.6% consumed at a minimum of 6 units of alcohol at a frequency of at least once monthly. The nature of hangovers had changed for about a third of the patients, with 21.6% reporting these to feel weaker or absent. Repeated alcoholic blackouts were reported by 11.9%. A subgroup of the patients were categorized as displaying presumed problematic drinking behavior(PPDB). Among the PPDB-men there was a significant association to having had a fall last year (6 (100.0%) PPDB-patients vs. 30 (29.7%) non-PPDB, p<.001). Among the PPDB-women, there was a significant association to having had alcohol problems prior to surgery (7 (70.0%) PPDB-patients vs. 67 (17.7%) non-PPDB, p<.001). Less significant associations to PPDB reported for explorative purposes were lack of patient education (men) (16 (26.2%) PPDB-patients vs. 8 (61.5%) non-PPDB, p=.014); more than 3 months persistent musculoskeletal pain (women) (45 (15.3%) PPDB-patients vs. 29 (24.6%) non-PPDB, p=.026); subjective problems with memory (women) (58 (20.7%) PPDB-patients vs. 10 (9.1%) non-PPDB, p=.006); and, receiving professional help for mental problems last 12 months (women) (29 (22.7%) PPDB-patients vs. 45 (14.7%) non-PPDB, p=.043). A subset of patients display drinking behaviors that may be consistent with postsurgical alcohol problems. Screening instruments like AUDIT may not be sufficiently specific to capture several risk behaviors occurring after bariatric surgery.",10.3389/fendo.2021.679006,,,,1315
1503,"Serum retinol-binding protein 4 is not increased in obesity or obesity-associated type 2 diabetes mellitus, but is reduced after relevant reductions in body fat following gastric bypass.","Controversy exists regarding the elevation of serum retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) in human obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In the present study, we have compared serum RBP4 in lean and obese patients with or without T2DM, and analysed the effect of weight loss on serum RBP4. Forty-two Caucasian subjects were included in the study. Serum RBP4 was measured by ELISA and Western blot. In addition, serum RBP4 was measured in 21 morbidly obese patients before and after 4, 8 and 15 months of weight loss following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP). No significant effect of either obesity or diabetes on serum RBP4 was observed. Serum RBP4 concentrations (measured by either ELISA or Western blot) did not correlate with body mass index (BMI), body fat or any indicator of glucose metabolism or insulin resistance. Weight loss following RYGBP did not modify serum RBP4 at 15 months (P = 0.472). However, the variations in serum RBP4 were significantly associated with the reduction in body fat (r = 0.48; P = 0.026). Patients loosing over 20% of fat mass (n = 11) showed significantly different RBP4 concentrations compared to those individuals exhibiting smaller adiposity reductions (n = 10) (-11.0 +/- 6.4 vs.+5.8 +/- 3.6 mg/l; P = 0.036). Furthermore, RBP4 levels were significantly reduced at 4 (P = 0.006) and 8 (P = 0.015) months only in those patients loosing over 20% of fat mass. Serum RBP4 concentrations are not increased in obese patients with or without T2DM. A decrease in RBP4 levels was only observed after surgically induced weight loss accompanied by relevant reductions in body fat. RBP4 might be considered as a dynamic marker of negative energy balance being reduced during weight loss when a negative energy balance threshold is reached. Furthermore, RBP4 variation in the first month after RYGBP may be a predictor of weight loss success.",10.1111/j.1365-2265.2007.03156.x,,,,1316
571,DENTAL WEAR AND TOOTH LOSS IN MORBID OBESE PATIENTS AFTER BARIATRIC SURGERY.,"Obesity and its surgical treatment have been related with oral diseases. Aim: To evaluate and compare dental wear and dental loss in eutrophic and morbidly obese patients submitted to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Observational and analytical study with gender and age matching. The sample consisted of 240 patients, divided into four groups: eutrophic (GC=60), morbidly obese (GO=60), operated with up to 24 months (G24=60) and operated on for more than 36 months (G36=60). The following variables were analyzed: race, schooling, economic class, hypertension, diabetes, triglycerides, cholesterol, BMI, weight loss, waist-hip ratio, smoking, alcoholism, tooth loss and tooth wear. GO presented lower economic class (p=0.012), hypertension (p<0.001), diabetes (p<0.001), cholesterol (p=0.001), BMI (p<0.001), waist-hip ratio (p<0.001) and percentage of weight loss percent (p<0.001) than groups G24 and G36. Dental wear was higher among the II and V sextants. Individuals submitted to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, regardless of the surgery period, presented more dental wear on the incisal/occlusal surfaces, and the anterior teeth were the most affected. Dental wear was associated with age and number of missing teeth.",10.1590/0102-672020190001e1458,,,,1317
465,"Is Laparoscopic Bariatric Surgery Safe and Effective in Patients over 60 Years of Age?"" an Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","To evaluate, mid-term outcomes between elderly patients (EP, i.e., age >â€‰60Â years old) and young patients (YP, i.e., ageâ€‰<â€‰=â€‰60Â years old) who underwent laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Studies comparing EP versus YP for bariatric surgery published until April 2020 were selected and submitted to a systematic review and meta-analysis. After LSG, overall morbidity and specific post-operative complication rates (i.e., leak, abscess, hemorrhage, and reoperation) were significantly more frequent in EP compared with those in YP. Surgical outcomes were similar between EP and YP after LRYGB. Both procedures achieved weight loss, but it was statistically greater in YP compared with that in EP. In summary, this meta-analysis suggests that laparoscopic bariatric surgery is a safe and effective treatment in EP compared with that in YP.",10.1007/s11695-020-04994-3,,,,1318
440,Intrathoracic gastric fistula after bariatric surgery: a systematic review and pooled analysis.,"Even in the hands of highly experienced bariatric surgeons, perioperative complications are inevitable. Of these, leaks and fistulas are amongst the scariest complications. Intrathoracic gastric fistulas (ITGF) can be associated with serious morbidity, mostly when cases are misdiagnosed or detected with delay. This is a systematic review of the literature to investigate the clinical and surgical outcomes of morbidly obese adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of ITGF following bariatric surgery. A pooled analysis of 25 articles, encompassing 76 patients with post-bariatric ITGF, showed that the clinical outcome depends on the initial presentation, timing of the diagnosis in relation to symptom onset, and prompt and effective treatment. Any septic or unstable patient must undergo urgent surgical intervention, while stable patients might tolerate a step-up approach and watchful waiting for nonsurgical treatment. Among those who undergo surgery, treatment failure and the mortality rate are substantially high. Contingent upon a prompt management strategy, patients with postbariatric ITGF can generally have a favorable outcome in the long term.",10.1016/j.soard.2020.10.030,,,,1319
730,Longitudinal 5-Year Evaluation of Bone Density and Microarchitecture After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery.,"Bone health declines in the initial years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), but long-term skeletal effects are unclear. To document longitudinal changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and microarchitecture 5 years after RYGB. Prospective 5-year observational study of 21 adults with severe obesity receiving RYGB at an academic medical center. Spine and hip areal BMD were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and trabecular volumetric BMD (vBMD) of the spine was assessed by quantitative CT (QCT). We measured vBMD and microarchitecture of the distal radius and tibia by high-resolution peripheral QCT in a subset of subjects. Serum type I collagen C-terminal telopeptide (CTX) and procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) were also measured. Areal BMD declined by -7.8% Â± 7.6% at the spine and -15.3% Â± 6.3% at the total hip by 5 years after RYGB (P â‰¤ 0.001), although the rate of bone loss slowed in later years. Trabecular spine vBMD decreased by -12.1% Â± 12.3% by 5 years (P â‰¤ 0.001). At peripheral sites, vBMD continued to decrease steadily throughout 5 years, with parallel declines in cortical and trabecular microarchitecture, leading to decreases in estimated failure load of -20% and -13% at the radius and tibia, respectively (P < 0.001). Five years after RYGB, CTX and P1NP were 150% and 34% above baseline (P < 0.001 and P = 0.017, respectively). Sustained high-turnover bone loss and bone microarchitectural deterioration occur in the 5 years after RYGB. Adults receiving RYGB warrant assessment of bone health.",10.1210/jc.2018-01496,,,,1320
1084,Three-Dimensional (3D) Versus Two-Dimensional (2D) Laparoscopic Bariatric Surgery: a Single-Surgeon Prospective Randomized Comparative Study.,"To address the issue whether three-dimensional (3D) offers real operative time advantages to the laparoscopic surgical procedure, we have designed a single-surgeon prospective randomized comparison of 3D versus two-dimensional (2D) imaging during two different bariatric procedures. Forty morbidly obese patients were randomized on the day of surgery by a random computer-generated allocation list to receive either a 3D high-definition (HD) display or 2D HD imaging system laparoscopic bariatric procedure by a single experienced surgeon. Forty operations were performed with either a 3D HD display or 2D HD imaging system. After the insertion of the access ports, both surgical procedures were divided in component tasks, and the execution times were compared. The execution times for the entire procedure and the single tasks were not significantly different between the 2D and 3D groups during sleeve gastrectomy. The execution times for the entire procedure and the single tasks, except for the first one, were significantly different between the 2D and 3D groups during mini-gastric bypass (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). The surgeon experienced better depth perception with the 3D system and subjectively reported less strain using 3D vision system rather than the 2D system particularly during longer procedure. 3D imaging seems to decrease the performance time of more difficult bariatric procedures, which involve surgical tasks as suturing and intestinal measurement. Further comparative studies are necessary to address the issue if novice surgeons could benefit from reduced learning curve requested with 3D vision and to verify with greater numbers if 3D imaging can reduce complications.",10.1007/s11695-015-1674-y,,,,1321
1627,Evaluation of intra-abdominal pressure after laparoscopic and open gastric bypass.,"Increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) postoperatively can adversely affect cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal function. In this prospective, randomized trial, we compared the IAP in morbidly obese patients after laparoscopic and open gastric bypass (GBP) surgery. 64 patients with a body mass index of 40 to 60 kg/m2 were randomized to undergo laparoscopic or open GBP. IAPs were obtained at baseline (after induction of anesthesia), immediately after the operation, and on post-operative day (POD) 1, 2, and 3. Intraoperative and postoperative fluid requirements, urine output, and creatinine clearance were recorded. Demographics of the two groups were similar. IAP increased from baseline immediately after laparoscopic and open GBP (p < 0.05). IAP returned to baseline by POD 2 after laparoscopic GBP but remained elevated through POD 3 after open GBP. In fact, IAP was lower after laparoscopic GBP than after open GBP on POD 1, 2 and 3 (p < 0.05). The amount of intraoperative IV fluid was similar between groups, but laparoscopic GBP required less IV fluid and facilitated higher urine output postoperatively than open GBP. There was no significant difference in creatinine clearance between groups. Laparoscopic GBP resulted in significantly lower IAP, less postoperative fluid required, and greater postoperative urine output than open GBP.",10.1381/096089201321454097,,,,1322
1418,Rise of oxyntomodulin in response to oral glucose after gastric bypass surgery in patients with type 2 diabetes.,"The mechanisms by which Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (GBP) results in sustained weight loss and remission of type 2 diabetes are not fully understood. We hypothesized that the anorexic hormone oxyntomodulin (OXM) might contribute to the marked weight reduction and the rapid improvement in glucose metabolism observed in morbidly obese diabetic patients after GBP. Twenty obese women with type 2 diabetes were studied before and 1 month after GBP (n=10) or after a diet-induced equivalent weight loss (n=10). Patients from both groups were matched for age, body weight, body mass index, and diabetes duration and control. OXM concentrations were measured during a 50-g oral glucose challenge before and after weight loss. At baseline, OXM levels (fasting and stimulated values) were indistinguishable between the GBP and the diet group. However, OXM levels rose remarkably in response to an oral glucose load more than 2-fold (peak, 5.25+/-1.31 to13.8+/-16.2 pmol/liter; P=0.025) after GBP but not after diet. The peak of OXM after glucose was significantly correlated with glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY3-36. Our data suggest that the observed changes in OXM primarily occur in response to GBP and not as a consequence of weight loss. These changes were observed early after surgery and occurred in parallel with previously reported increases in incretins and peptide YY. We speculate that the combination of gut hormone changes is essential for the improved glucose homeostasis and may partially explain the success of this surgery on diabetes resolution and weight loss.",10.1210/jc.2009-2767,,,,1323
604,The Short-Term Effects of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass on Renal Excretion of Sodium and Its Association with Blood Pressure.,"Bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in reducing weight and has benefits, such as lowering blood pressure. An increase in urinary sodium excretion has been suggested as a possible mechanism. This study explored changes in sodium excretion and their correlation with blood pressure after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This study was conducted on 28 obese participants with body mass index (BMI) of 44.54â€‰Â±â€‰7.81Â kg/m2 who underwent gastric bypass. Before surgery and at the third and sixth months after gastric bypass, blood pressure, urinary sodium concentration, 24-hour (24-h) urinary sodium excretion, and fractional excretion of sodium were evaluated. In addition, serum sodium and potassium levels were determined. Nonparametric tests were used to analyze the data. Blood pressure decreased after surgery and remained at low levels over the 3- and 6-month periods. The urinary sodium concentration increased at 3Â months after surgery; however, the 24-h urinary sodium excretion and urine volume decreased. Interestingly, although some associations between variables were observed, significant correlations between the 24-h urinary sodium excretion and the systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures were found. In addition, the urine volume was higher in the sixth month than in the third month following surgery. In the months immediately following surgery, a low-salt and low-volume diet favors decreases in urine volume and 24-h urinary sodium excretion. In addition, in the sixth month after surgery, an association between blood pressure and 24-h urinary sodium excretion was observed.",10.1007/s11695-019-04134-6,,,,1324
878,Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy Does Not Affect Food Preferences When Assessed by an Ad libitum Buffet Meal.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) lead to a reduction in energy intake. It is uncertain whether this reduction is simply due to eating smaller portions or if surgery changes food preferences towards less energy-dense food. Previous results rely on verbal reports, which may be prone to recall bias and underestimation of especially unhealthy foods. Using an ad libitum buffet meal targeting direct behavior, we investigated if RYGB and SG surgery leads to changes in food preferences. In addition, we assessed food preferences by a picture display test to explore differences between a method relying on verbal report and a method assessing direct behavior. Forty-one subjects (BMI 45.0Â Â±Â 6.8Â kg/m2) completed a visit pre- and 6Â months post-RYGB (nÂ =Â 31) and SG (nÂ =Â 10). Mean BMI decreased with 11.7Â Â±Â 0.6Â kg/m2 and total energy intake at the buffet meal with 54% (4491Â Â±Â 208Â kJ vs. 2083Â Â±Â 208Â kJ, PÂ <Â 0.001), respectively. However, relative energy intake from the following food categories: high-fat, low-fat, sweet, savory, high-fat-savory, high-fat-sweet, low-fat-savory, and low-fat-sweet, as well as energy density did not change following surgery (all PÂ â‰¥Â 0.18). In contrast, the picture display test showed that food from the low-fat-savory group was chosen more often post-surgery (34Â Â±Â 8% vs. 65Â Â±Â 9%, PÂ =Â 0.02). The reduction in energy intake after RYGB and SG surgery and the subsequent weight loss seems to be primarily related to a reduction in portion sizes and not by changes in food preferences towards less energy-dense foods. These results underline the necessity of investigating eating behavior by targeting direct behavior.",10.1007/s11695-017-2678-6,,,,1325
1617,Uncommon intragastric migration of the Swedish adjustable gastric band.,"The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of intragastric migration of the Swedish adjustable gastric band (SAGB) and to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of gastroscopic band removal. Between January 1996 and December 2001, 454 patients (381 women, 73 men) underwent a laparoscopic SAGB operation. All data (age, gender, pre- and postoperative weight, time of weight gain, band filling status, endoscopic diagnosis of migration, total weight reduction) were prospectively collected in a computerized data bank. Out of the 454 SAGB operations, 14 (3.1%) intragastric band migrations were observed. The average preoperative weight was 122.2 kg and the average postoperative minimum weight was 80.4 kg. All 14 patients had unexplained weight gain on an average of 20 months after the operation. The average band filling status was 8.2 ml. In 12 patients, the band was removed endoscopically, avoiding laparotomy. The remaining 2 patients are under endoscopic surveillance. The mean operating time was 120 minutes. No peri- or postoperative complication was observed. Intragastric band migration is a rare complication and should be considered if a patient starts to regain weight. Migration does not require immediate therapy and therefore this complication could be safely treated endoscopically.",10.1381/096089202321088183,,,,1326
945,Effect of Boussignac continuous positive airway pressure ventilation on Pao2 and Pao2/Fio2 ratio immediately after extubation in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery: a randomized controlled trial.,"Pathophysiological changes after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass may increase the risk of pulmonary complications in morbidly obese patients. The purpose of the study was to assess the impact of immediate postextubation use of Boussignac continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on arterial oxygenation in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The hypothesis is that the use of CPAP may improve oxygenation in the postoperative period when compared to Venturi mask. Randomized controlled study. A tertiary referral hospital. Recruited morbidly obese adult patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Boussignac CPAP or Venturi mask was randomly applied immediately after extubation in the operating room and was maintained during the first 2 hours in the recovery room. Pao2 and Pao2/fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) ratio values were measured preoperatively and at 1 (T1), 2 (T2), and 24 hours (T24) after extubation, through arterial blood samples. Secondary outcomes (spirometric parameters) were measured at the same periods. For comparison between groups, Student t test, Mann-Whitney U nonparametric test, and Ï‡(2) test were used. Statistical significance is at P < .05. Twenty-four patients were included, 12 in each group. There were no differences in preoperative evaluation. There were significant differences between groups in Pao2 and Pao2/Fio2 mean values at T1, T2, and T24, being superior in the Boussignac group. During the 24 hours postextubation, 9% of patients in the Boussignac group and 50% in the Venturi group had a Pao2 less than 60 mm Hg in at least 1 of the evaluations. After extubation, a Pao2/Fio2 ratio value less than 300 was observed in all patients in the Venturi group and in 55% in Boussignac group in at least 1 of the evaluations. There were no differences in spirometric parameters between groups at T1, T2, and T24. Application of Boussignac CPAP for 2 hours after extubation improved oxygenation but did not improve forced expiratory volume at 1 second and forced vital capacity.",10.1016/j.jclinane.2016.06.024,,,,1327
1540,Combined preemptive and preventive analgesia in morbidly obese patients undergoing open gastric bypass: A pilot study.,"It is difficult to balance adequate pain control against the risk of sedation and depressed breathing in severely obese patients. This study assesses the effects of combined preemptive and preventive analgesia on narcotic use after open gastric bypass. Twenty patients were randomized in this prospective double-blind trial comparing preoperative 30 mg intravenous ketorolac (Toradol), 0.25% subcutaneous bupivacaine (Marcaine) with epinephrine along the planned incision, and 0.25% bupivacaine in the rectus fascia before closing with identical injections with 0.9% saline. The patients' self-assessed pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and total narcotic use by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and rescue medication were recorded. Age, body mass index (BMI), incision length, and operative times were similar between the two groups, as was the average length of hospital stay (2.9 days). Self-reported pain was less in the treatment group 1 hour postoperatively (P = .01). Narcotic use was less in the treatment group during the first 2 hospital days (51% less on day 1 vs 44.5% less on day 2). Total narcotic use during the hospital stay was reduced by 40% (P = .02). Patients receiving combined preemptive and preventive analgesia used significantly less narcotic pain medication than the patients receiving placebo. The effect lasted beyond the duration of action of the local anesthetic.",10.1016/j.soard.2004.12.007,,,,1328
1245,Differential influences of gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy on plasma nesfatin-1 and obestatin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"The mechanisms by which bariatric surgeries, including gastric bypass (GB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG), achieve remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and sustained weight reduction are unknown. We hypothesized that the novel anorexic hormone nesfatin-1 and another new hormone obestatin might contribute to the marked improvement in glycemic homeostasis and weight loss in diabetics after GB and SG. A hospital-based, prospective study was conducted. Overnight fasting plasma concentrations of nesfatin-1 and obestatin were analyzed in T2DM patients before surgery, and at 3 and 12 months after laparoscopic GB (n =12) and SG (n = 6). At 12 months, reductions of body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose, and glycated hemoglobin were similar between GB and SG groups (P all > 0.05). Plasma nesfatin-1 levels in patients undergoing GB or SG significantly decreased after surgeries (P both < 0.05). In contrast, plasma obestatin concentrations significantly increased in patients after SG (P < 0.05) but without any alteration after GB. The alterations of plasma nesfatin-1 were significantly and negatively associated with the reduction of fasting blood glucose (P <0.05) at 12 months after GB and SG. In the SG group, the reduction of nesfatin-1 significantly and positively correlated with the decrease of BMI (P < 0.05). GB and SG produce differential influences with regards to circulating nesfatin-1 and obestatin levels in non-morbidly obese, T2DM patients. Circulating nesfatin-1 may modulate glucose homeostasis in two surgical procedures, and participate in regulating body weight in SG.",10.2174/13816128113198880010,,,,1329
191,Cardiac fat pat change after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Cardiac fat pad is a metabolically active organ that plays a role in energy homeostasis and cardiovascular diseases and generates inflammatory cytokines. Many studies have shown remarkable associations between cardiac fat thickness and cardiovascular diseases, making it a valuable target for interventions. Our meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effects of the 2 most popular bariatric surgeries (sleeve gastrectomy [SG] and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [RYGB]) in cardiac fat pad reduction. A systematic review of the literature was done by searching in Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, and PubMed for articles published by September 16, 2022. This review followed the meta-analysis rules based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria out of 128 potentially useful studies, including a total number of 822 patients. The results of subgroup analysis on the type of surgery showed that bariatric surgeries decreased the mean fat pad diameter, but the reduction was greater in SG than in RYGB. Epicardial and pericardial fat type showed a significant decrease of fat pad diameter. The results of subgroup analysis indicated RYGB had a significant reduction in mean fat pad volume. Computed tomography scan and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed a significant reduction of the mean cardiac fat pad volume. Epicardial and paracardial fat type showed a significant decrease in volume. The cardiac fat pad diameter and volume were significantly reduced after bariatric surgeries. SG showed greater reduction in fat pad diameter in comparison with RYGB, and RYGB had a significant reduction in mean fat pad volume.",10.1016/j.soard.2022.12.016,,,,1330
742,"Effect of calcium citrate vs calcium carbonate on elevated parathyroid hormone after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. A double-blinded, randomized trial.","Following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels potentially harmful to bone health are commonly observed. Owing to assumed superior absorption, calcium citrate is often recommended over calcium carbonate following RYGB for the treatment of elevated PTH. We aimed to investigate the impact of either calcium carbonate or calcium citrate (1200Â mg elementary calcium) in patients with elevated PTH levels following RYGB. Clinical, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial of a 12-week duration at a Danish University Hospital. Thirty-nine (no drop out) RYGB operated patients with elevated PTH levels (PTHÂ >Â 6.9Â pmol/L) and normal plasma levels of calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were randomized to either calcium carbonate or calcium citrate (1200Â mg elementary calcium/daily). We assessed change in PTH as the primary outcome. The effect of the two calcium formulations on change in PTH was comparable and neutral: -1.9% (calcium citrate) vs +0.9% (calcium carbonate), PÂ =Â 0.680. Compared to the carbonate-treated group, the following bone turnover markers decreased significantly in the citrate-treated group: procollagen I N-terminal propeptide (-16.6% vs -3.2%, PÂ =Â 0.021), osteocalcin (-17.2% vs -4.3%, PÂ =Â 0.007) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (-5.9% vs 3.7%, PÂ =Â 0.027) and remained significantly decreased after multivariable adjustment. Increasing the dose of calcium supplementation in RYGB operated patients with slightly elevated PTH levels does not normalize PTH levels, regardless of the type of supplement. Our results do not support recommending supplementation with calcium citrate over calcium carbonate in RYGB patients.",10.1111/cen.13836,,,,1331
706,The importance of the biliopancreatic limb length in gastric bypass: A systematic review.,"Bariatric surgery has proven to be the most durable treatment for obesity, and it also provides improvement of obesity's associated co-morbidities. Although several mechanisms for its metabolic effects have been studied, the implications of the surgically constructed anatomy on its functioning physiology have not been elucidated. This leaves some uncertainty regarding the recommended limb lengths in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The alimentary limb length and function has been studied extensively, but few have studied the influences of the biliopancreatic limb length. To present a systematic review of the literature comparing variations in length of BP limb and results in order to determine BP limb length influence. Academic Hospital, United States. We present a systematic review of all the articles comparing variations of the biliopancreatic limb length and their results. Thirteen articles were identified and analyzed. Most of the articles are prospective studies. Weight loss was superior in longer limbs. Based on our review of the subject, we can conclude that the release of enterohormones in response to a food load in the distal small bowel seems to play an important role in the remission of co-morbidities. Hence, the length of the biliopancreatic limb might affect this process.",10.1016/j.soard.2018.10.013,,,,1332
1650,Pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular function in morbid obesity in relation to gastric bypass surgery.,"To investigate right ventricular function (RVF) during gastric bypass surgery in morbidly obese patients. To study the influence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome on hemodynamics and RVF as a preoperative evaluation in morbidly obese patients. Prospective study. Surgical patients at a university hospital. 14 morbidly obese patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery. Hemodynamic changes and RVF were investigated using a thermodilution ejection fraction volumetric catheter and the REF-1 computer. Hemodynamic parameters and RVF were measured: (1) before induction of anesthesia, awake, (2) after induction of anesthesia, (3) after opening the abdomen, and (4) after closing the abdomen. Esophageal pressure was measured in the midesophagus after induction of anesthesia with a camino catheter and its device. Morbidly obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome had significantly lower PaO2, higher PaCO2, and higher pulmonary artery (PA) pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) compared with patients without sleep apnea (p < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences in heart rate, mean blood pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF), and right ventricular end-diastolic volume. During gastric bypass procedure, PA pressure, PCWP, and PVR decreased significantly after opening the abdomen (p < 0.05). There were no significant changes in RVEF and cardiac index during gastric bypass procedure. The presence of chronic hypoxemia and hypercarbia in our morbidly obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome while awake, causes significant increases in PA pressure and PVR. We also demonstrated that RVEF did not change significantly during gastric bypass procedure despite significant decreases in PA pressure, PCWP, and PVR after opening the abdomen. This decrease in PA pressure and PVR may be caused by decreases in pleural pressure reflected by a concomitant decrease in esophageal pressure.",10.1016/0952-8180(95)00231-6,,,,1333

1080,Drug disposition and modelling before and after gastric bypass: immediate and controlled-release metoprolol formulations.,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the disposition of metoprolol after oral administration of an immediate and controlled-release formulation before and after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery in the same individuals and to validate a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for predicting oral bioavailability following RYGB. A single-dose pharmacokinetic study of metoprolol tartrate 200â€‰mg immediate release and controlled release was performed in 14 volunteers before and 6-8â€‰months after RYGB. The observed data were compared with predicted results from the PBPK modelling and simulation of metoprolol tartrate immediate and controlled-release formulation before and after RYGB. After administration of metoprolol immediate and controlled release, no statistically significant difference in the observed area under the curve (AUC(0-24â€‰h)) was shown, although a tendency towards an increased oral exposure could be observed as the AUC(0-24â€‰h) was 32.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36, 63.5] and 55.9% (95% CI 5.73, 106) higher following RYGB for the immediate and controlled-release formulation, respectively. This could be explained by surgery-related weight loss and a reduced presystemic biotransformation in the proximal gastrointestinal tract. The PBPK values predicted by modelling and simulation were similar to the observed data, confirming its validity. The disposition of metoprolol from an immediate-release and a controlled-release formulation was not significantly altered after RYGB; there was a tendency to an increase, which was also predicted by PBPK modelling and simulation.",10.1111/bcp.12666,,,,1335
391,Does the non-absorbable suture closure of the jejunal mesenteric defect reduce the incidence and severity of internal hernias after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass?,"Internal hernias (IH) are frequent complications after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). Closure of the jejunal mesenteric and the Petersen defect reduces IH incidence in prospective and retrospective trials. This study investigates whether closing the jejunal mesenteric space alone by non-absorbable suture and splitting the omentum can be beneficial to prevent IH after LRYGB. Observational cohort study of 785 patients undergoing linear LRYGB including omental split at a single institution, with 493 patients without jejunal mesenteric defect closure and 292 patients with closure by non-absorbable suture, and a minimal follow-up of 2 years. Patients were assessed for appearance and severity of IH. Additionally, open mesenteric gaps without herniated bowel as well as early obstructions due to kinking of the entero-enterostomy (EE) were explored. Through primary mesenteric defect closure, the rate of manifest jejunal mesenteric and Petersen IH could be reduced from 6.5 to 3.8%, but without reaching statistical significance. The most common location for an IH was the jejunal mesenteric space, where defect closure during primary surgery reduced the rate of IH from 5.3 to 2.4%. Higher weight loss seemed to increase the risk of developing an IH. The closure of the jejunal mesenteric defect by non-absorbable suture may reduce the rate of IH at the jejunal mesenteric space after LRYGB. However, the beneficial effect in our collective is smaller than expected, particularly in patients with good weight loss. The Petersen IH rate remained low by consequent T-shape split of the omentum without suturing of the defect.",10.1007/s00423-021-02180-2,,,,1336
1306,Gastric bypass surgery for obesity decreases the reward value of a sweet-fat stimulus as assessed in a progressive ratio task.,"Obesity is among the leading causes of disease and death. Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment of obesity. There is increasing evidence that after gastric bypass surgery, patients and animal models show a decreased preference for sweet and fatty foods. The underlying mechanism may include alterations in taste function. We hypothesize that a gastric bypass reduces the reward value of sweet and fat tastes. In this prospective case-control study, 11 obese patients who were scheduled to undergo a gastric bypass and 11 normal-weight control subjects in the fed state clicked a computer mouse to receive a sweet and fatty candy on a progressive ratio schedule 10 wk apart (in patients, testing took place 2 wk before and 8 wk after gastric bypass surgery). Subjects worked progressively harder to obtain a food reward (reinforcer) until they stopped clicking (ie, the breakpoint), which was a measure of the reinforcer value. Breakpoints were assessed by the number of mouse clicks in the last completed ratio. The experiment was repeated in a different cohort by using vegetable pieces as the reinforcer. Breakpoints in the test sessions of control subjects correlated highly for both reinforcers. The median breakpoint for candies, but not vegetables, was reduced by 50% in the obese group after gastric bypass. Patients with the largest reduction in the breakpoint had the largest decrease in BMI. Gastric bypass surgery resulted in the selective reduction of the reward value of a sweet and fat tastant. This application of the progressive ratio task provided an objective and reliable evaluation of taste-driven motivated behavior for food stimuli after obesity surgery.",10.3945/ajcn.112.036921,,,,1337
876,Dumping symptoms is triggered by fat as well as carbohydrates in patients operated with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Dumping syndrome after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is traditionally associated with the consumption of refined carbohydrates, but the role of dietary fat is unclear. This study compares symptoms after consumption of a carbohydrate-rich or fat-rich beverage to determine perceived symptoms, glycemic control, and pulse rate. University hospital. We assessed perceived symptoms (Sigstad's Dumping Index) and glycemic control (P-glucose and S-insulin) as well as autonomic nervous system activity (reflected by arterial pulse rate) after a standardized liquid meal test (440 kcal/300 mL carbohydrates [CARB] or fat [FAT]) in a randomized crossover blinded setting. Blood samples were drawn before and 1, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after finishing each meal and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Twelve patients 42Â±10 months after undergoing RYGB were studied. AUC differed between drinks for glucose (P = .003) and insulin (P = .005). Pulse rate increased more after CARB than after FAT (P = .01). AUC for perceived symptoms in the Sigstad's Dumping Index were similar after meals (P = .79), yet the pattern of type of symptoms differed. In patients with RYGB, a meal with predominant fat content resulted in as much perceived dumping symptoms as a carbohydrate-profiled meal. As expected, an increase in glucose and insulin levels were found only after carbohydrate intake and the pulse rise was more pronounced for carbohydrates than fat. Dietary counseling in patients undergoing RYGB should address dietary fat as well as traditional information about carbohydrates to avoid dumping symptoms.",10.1016/j.soard.2017.02.020,,,,1338
754,AIRWAY POSITIVE PRESSURE VS. EXERCISES WITH INSPIRATORY LOADING FOCUSED ON PULMONARY AND RESPIRATORY MUSCULAR FUNCTIONS IN THE POSTOPERATIVE PERIOD OF BARIATRIC SURGERY.,"Bariatric surgery can trigger postoperative pulmonary complications due to factors inherent to the procedure, mainly due to diaphragmatic dysfunction. To evaluate and compare the effects of two levels of positive pressure and exercises with inspiratory load on lung function, inspiratory muscle strength and respiratory muscle resistance, and the prevalence of atelectasis after gastroplasty. Clinical, randomized and blind trial, with subjects submitted to bariatric surgery, allocated to two groups: positive pressure group, who received positive pressure at two levels during one hour and conventional respiratory physiotherapy and inspiratory load group, who performed exercises with load linear inspiratory pressure, six sets of 15 repetitions, in addition to conventional respiratory physiotherapy, both of which were applied twice in the immediate postoperative period and three times a day on the first postoperative day. Spirometry was performed for pulmonary function analysis, nasal inspiratory pressure for inspiratory muscle strength and incremental test of respiratory muscle resistance for sustained maximal inspiratory pressure, both preoperatively and on hospital discharge on the second postoperative day. There was no significant difference (p> 0.05) in the expiratory reserve volume and in the tidal volume in the pre and postoperative periods when compared intra and intergroup. There was no significant difference (p>0.05) in the nasal inspiratory pressure and the maximal inspiratory pressure maintained in the inspiratory load group in the intragroup evaluation, but with a significant difference (p<0.05) compared to the positive pressure group. The prevalence of atelectasis was 5% in both groups with no significant difference (p>0.05) between them. Both groups, associated with conventional respiratory physiotherapy, preserved expiratory reserve volume and tidal volume and had a low atelectasis rate. The inspiratory loading group still maintained inspiratory muscle strength and resistance of respiratory muscles.",10.1590/0102-672020180001e1363,,,,1339
1489,Lipid mobilization following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass examined by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy.,"Recent developments of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy have made it possible to quantify lipid deposited in different tissues. To what extent an improvement of glucose tolerance shortly after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGBP) is reflected in lipid levels in liver and skeletal muscle, markers of insulin resistance, has not been clarified. Whole-body MRI and MR spectroscopy (MRS) of liver and muscle and measurements of biochemical markers of glucose and lipid metabolism were performed at baseline and 1, 6, and 12 months following surgery in seven morbidly obese women. Volumes of adipose tissue depots and liver and muscle lipids were assessed from the MRI/MRS data. At 1 month postoperatively, body mass index and visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues were reduced by 9%, 26%, and 10%, respectively, whereas no reductions in intrahepatocellular or skeletal intramyocellular lipid concentrations were found. Free fatty acid and beta-hydroxybutyrate levels were elevated two- and sixfold, respectively; glucose and insulin levels were lowered, indicating increased insulin sensitivity. Further weight loss up to 1 year was associated with reductions in all investigated lipid depots investigated, with the exception of the intramyocellular compartment. RYGBP causes rapid lipid mobilization from visceral and subcutaneous adipose depots and enhanced free fatty acid flux to the liver. An exceptional disconnection between liver fat and insulin sensitivity occurs in the early dynamic phase after surgery. However, in the late phase, the energy restriction imposed by the surgical procedure also reduces the liver lipids, but not the intramyocellular lipids.",10.1007/s11695-008-9484-0,,,,1340
1224,Effect of bariatric surgery on liver glucose metabolism in morbidly obese diabetic and non-diabetic patients.,"Bariatric surgery reduces weight and improves glucose metabolism in obese patients. We investigated the effects of bariatric surgery on hepatic insulin sensitivity. Twenty-three morbidly obese (nine diabetic and fourteen non-diabetic) patients and ten healthy, lean control subjects were studied using positron emission tomography to assess hepatic glucose uptake in the fasting state and during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed to measure liver fat content and magnetic resonance imaging to obtain liver volume. Obese patients were studied before bariatric surgery (either sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) and six months after surgery. Insulin-induced hepatic glucose uptake was increased by 33% in non-diabetic and by 36% in diabetic patients at follow-up compared with baseline, but not totally normalized. The liver fat content was reduced by 76%, liver volume by 26% and endogenous glucose production by 19% in non-diabetic patients. The respective changes in diabetic patients were 73%, 24%, and 25%. Postoperatively, liver fat content and endogenous glucose production were almost normalized to lean controls, but liver volume remained greater than in control subjects. This study shows that bariatric surgery leads to a significant improvement in hepatic insulin sensitivity: insulin-stimulated hepatic glucose uptake was improved and endogenous glucose production reduced when measured, six-months, after surgery. These metabolic effects were accompanied by a marked reduction in hepatic volume and fat content. Overall, the gain in hepatic insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients was quite similar to non-diabetic patients for the same weight reduction.",10.1016/j.jhep.2013.09.012,,,,1341
1241,Cognitive function is linked to adherence to bariatric postoperative guidelines.,"Impairment in cognitive function is found in a significant subset of individuals undergoing bariatric surgery, and recent work shows this impairment is associated with smaller postoperative weight loss. Reduced cognitive function could contribute to poorer adherence to postoperative guidelines, although this has not been previously examined. The present study examined the relationship between cognitive function and adherence to bariatric postoperative guidelines. We expected that higher cognitive function would be associated with better adherence to postoperative guidelines. Thirty-seven bariatric surgery patients completed cognitive testing and a self-report measure of adherence to postoperative bariatric guidelines during their 4- to 6-week postoperative appointment. Strong correlations were observed between adherence to postoperative guidelines and cognitive indices of attention, executive function, and memory. Results show that cognitive performance is strongly associated with adherence to postoperative guidelines shortly after bariatric surgery. Further work is needed to clarify whether this relationship is present at later postoperative stages and the degree to which this relationship mediates postoperative weight loss outcomes.",10.1016/j.soard.2013.04.007,,,,1342
805,Sleeve gastrectomy surgery: when 2 alcoholic drinks are converted to 4.,"While it is well established that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) causes a rapid and heightened peak blood alcohol concentration (BAC), results from previous studies on the effects of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) on alcohol pharmacokinetics are conflicting. Data from 2 studies found SG did not affect BAC, whereas another study found SG caused a heightened peak BAC after alcohol ingestion. Moreover, these 3 studies estimated BAC from breathalyzers, which might not reliably estimate peak BAC. The aims of this study were to evaluate (1) the effect of SG, relative to RYGB and a presurgery group, on alcohol pharmacokinetics and subjective effects, and (2) whether breathalyzers are reliable in this population. Single-center prospective nonrandomized trial. We performed alcohol challenge tests in 11 women who had SG surgery 1.9 Â± .1 years ago (body mass index = 35.1 Â± 6.6 kg/m2), 8 women who had RYGB surgery 2.2 Â± .4 years ago (body mass index = 30.0 Â± 5.2 kg/m2), and 9 women who were scheduled for bariatric surgery (body mass index = 44.1 Â± 4.0 kg/m2). BACs were estimated from breath samples and measured by gas chromatography at various times after consuming approximately 2 standard drinks. BAC increased faster, peak BAC was approximately 2-fold higher, and feelings of drunkenness were heightened in both SG and RYGB groups relative to the presurgery group (P values<.001). BAC estimated from breath samples underestimated BAC by 27% (standard deviation = 13%) and missed peak BACs postsurgery. SG, similar to RYGB, causes marked alterations in the response to alcohol ingestion manifested by a faster and higher peak BAC. The breathalyzer is invalid to assess effects of gastric surgeries on pharmacokinetics of ingested alcohol.",10.1016/j.soard.2017.11.010,,,,1343
1454,Comparison of the absorption of calcium carbonate and calcium citrate after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) restricts food intake. Consequently, patients consume less calcium. In addition, food no longer passes through the duodenum, the main site of calcium absorption. Therefore, calcium absorption is significantly impaired. The goal of this study is to compare two common calcium supplements in gastric bypass patients. Nineteen patients were enrolled in a randomized, double-blinded, crossover study comparing the absorption of calcium from calcium carbonate and calcium citrate salts. Serum and urine calcium levels were assessed for peak values (C (max)) and cumulative calcium increment (area under the curve [AUC]). Serum PTH was assessed for minimum values (PTH(min)) and cumulative PTH decrement (AUC). Statistical analysis was performed using a repeated analysis of variance model. Eighteen subjects completed the study. Calcium citrate resulted in a significantly higher serum C (max) (9.4 + 0.4 mg/dl vs. 9.2 + 0.3 mg/dl, p = 0.02) and serum AUC (55 + 2 mg/dl vs. 54 + 2 mg/dl, p = 0.02). Calcium citrate resulted in a significantly lower PTH(min) (24 + 11 pg/ml vs. 30 + 13 pg/ml, p = 0.01) and a higher AUC (-32 + 51 pg/ml vs. -3 + 56 pg/ml, p = 0.04). There was a non-significant trend for higher urinary AUC in the calcium citrate group (76.13 + 36.39 mg/6 h vs. 66.04 + 40.82, p = 0.17). Calcium citrate has superior bioavailability than calcium carbonate in RYGB patients.",10.1007/s11695-009-9850-6,,,,1344
1601,Different plasma ghrelin levels after laparoscopic gastric bypass and adjustable gastric banding in morbid obese subjects.,"Gastric bypass has been reported to be associated with markedly suppressed plasma ghrelin levels, suggesting that it is one of the possible weight-reducing factors related to this procedure. The aim of this study was the evaluation of plasma ghrelin levels in patients who had undergone laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP) and laparoscopic adjustable silicone gastric banding (LASGB). Normoweight, obese subjects and patients who had undergone total gastrectomy were used as controls. In this cross-sectional study, we selected 10 subjects who underwent LASGB, 11 subjects with LRYGBP, 10 obese subjects, eight patients with total gastrectomy, and eight normoweight subjects. Plasma ghrelin, insulin, and glucose profiles were determined before and after breakfast and lunch. Obese subjects showed a ghrelin plasma level significantly lower than normoweight subjects (407.3 +/- 21.6 vs. 813 +/- 72.4 pg/ml, P < 0.01). Patients with LRYGBP showed baseline ghrelin levels lower than LASGB (213.5 +/- 73.9 vs. 314.2 +/- 84.3 pg/ml, P = 0.04). Both groups of patients who underwent bariatric surgical procedures also had ghrelin lower than normoweight and obese subjects (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Patients with total gastrectomy showed plasmatic ghrelin levels extremely lower than those in all other groups (32.6 +/- 18.7 pg/ml, P < 0.001 for all). The ghrelin profile in both groups of subjects who underwent LRYGBP and LASGB did not show any meal-related changes as observed in obese and normoweight control groups. Significant difference in plasma ghrelin levels between LRYGBP and LASGB was found, suggesting that both procedures could induce weight loss by different mechanisms in which ghrelin could be involved.",10.1210/jc.2003-030133,,,,1345
1347,Factors associated with readmission after laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery.,"Studies have demonstrated that laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is associated with the greatest readmission rate among bariatric surgeries. Some readmissions might be avoidable. We sought to evaluate the risk factors for readmission in a high-volume bariatric surgery program at a university hospital in the United States. We performed a retrospective review of prospectively maintained data. Patients readmitted within 30 days of laparoscopic RYGB were randomly matched to control patients who had undergone RYGB in the same year but were not readmitted. The readmissions were categorized as technical complications (leak), wound infections, or malaise (nausea, dehydration, or benign abdominal pain). Patients with a wound infection treated in an outpatient setting were also evaluated and compared with the patients admitted with a wound infection. From July 2002 to July 2008, 450 patients underwent RYGB. Readmission occurred in 42 patients (9%). Of these 42 patients, 6 were admitted with wound infections (14%), 18 (43%) with malaise, and 18 (43%) with technical complications. The patients admitted with wound infections were similar to their controls, except that they were more likely to have publicly funded insurance (Medicare or Medicaid) and more likely to present for medical attention to the emergency department after clinic hours. The patients admitted with malaise reported a greater pain score at discharge and were also more likely to have public health insurance than controls. The patients with technical complications did not differ from the control patients in any examined variable. Patients with publicly funded insurance are at increased risk of readmission after RYGB. Outpatient mechanisms for managing wound infections and malaise might result in decreased readmissions.",10.1016/j.soard.2011.05.019,,,,1346
1603,Surgery as an intervention for obesity. Results from the Swedish obese subjects study.,"The prevalence of obesity is increasing dramatically all over the world, leading to suffering as well as high health care costs due to obesity-related co-morbidity. Long-term results from weight loss studies are hard to attain due to the difficulties in sustaining weight losses. Gastric surgery results in large and maintainable weight reductions. The Swedish obese subjects (SOS) study offers a unique possibility for investigating the effects of weight loss as compared with weight stability in obese subjects over a long period of time.",10.1016/s1096-6374(03)00049-2,,,,1347

27,A Systematic Review to Summarise and Appraise the Reporting of Surgical Innovation: a Case Study in Robotic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.,"Robotic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RRYGB) is an innovative alternative to traditional laparoscopic approaches. Literature has been published investigating its safety/efficacy; however, the quality of reporting is uncertain. This systematic review used the Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment and Long-term follow-up (IDEAL) framework to assess the reporting quality of available literature. A narrative summary was formulated, assessing how comprehensively governance/ethics, patient selection, demographics, surgeon expertise/training, technique description and outcomes were reported. Forty-seven studies published between 2005 and 2024 were included. There was incomplete/inconsistent reporting of governance/ethics, patient selection, surgeon expertise/training and technique description, with heterogenous outcome reporting. RRYGB reporting was poor and did not align with IDEAL guidance. Robust prospective studies reporting findings using IDEAL/other guidance are required to facilitate safe widespread adoption of RRYGB and other surgical innovations.",10.1007/s11695-024-07329-8,,,,1349
582,Roux-en-Y-Bariatric Surgery Reduces Markers of Metabolic Syndrome in Morbidly Obese Patients.,"Obesity is closely linked to increased markers of metabolic syndrome and development of diabetes. Roux-en-Y bariatric surgery reduces hyperinsulinemia and improves insulin sensitivity and hence benefits morbidly obese patients. To determine changes in markers of metabolic syndrome, pancreatic function, and hepatic insulin sensitivity in patients before and 1Â year after undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. We enrolled 43 consecutive patients in a single center. Markers for metabolic syndrome included proinsulin, insulin, C-peptide, liver enzymes, and serum levels of selected microRNAs hsa-miR-122, hsa-miR-130, hsa-miR-132, and hsa-miR-375. After surgery, all patients showed a significant 37% drop of body mass index (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Furthermore, proinsulin (59% reduction, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), insulin (76% reduction, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and C-peptide (56% reduction, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) were all reduced 1Â year after surgery. Using the hepatic insulin clearance score, we determined a significant increase in hepatic insulin clearance after surgery (76% increase, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Especially diabetic patients showed a marked 2.1-fold increase after surgery. Hepatic enzymes ALT (35% reduction, pâ€‰=â€‰0.002) and Î³GT (48% reduction, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) were significantly reduced in all patients with similar improvement in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. miRNAs hsa-miR-122, hsa-miR-130, and hsa-miR-132 were all significantly reduced whereas hsa-miR-375 was increased after gastric bypass surgery (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001 for all miRNAs). Both liver and pancreatic stress parameters were reduced significantly 1Â year after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery suggesting an overall amelioration of the metabolic syndrome in all patients regardless of previous health status.",10.1007/s11695-019-04190-y,,,,1350
1379,C-reactive protein decrease after postbariatric abdominoplasty.,"In a prospective study, indices of glucose homeostasis, lipid profile, and systemic inflammation were monitored after an aesthetic abdominoplasty, aiming to scrutinize the possible metabolic benefits for abdominal fat removal. Premenopausal females with substantial weight loss (N=40) undergoing circumferential abdominoplasty (index group, n=20) or augmentation mammoplasty with mastopexy (controls, n=20) were recruited. All of them originally underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Variables included BMI, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, hemoglobin, total cholesterol and fractions, triglycerides, glucose, and HbA1c. Follow-up reached 20.3 Â± 13.6 months for index cases and 29.5 Â± 17.4 months for controls. The metabolic and inflammatory indices improved after the bariatric surgery. Subsequent monitoring indicated a stable body weight and biochemical profile in both groups. The exceptions were HDL cholesterol and C-reactive protein, which respectively increased and diminished after the abdominoplasty, consistent with an inflammatory and metabolic advantage for this operation. This is the first long-term study in a weight-stable population to point out such a pattern after abdominoplasty.",10.1007/s10753-011-9321-9,,,,1351
1258,Effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding on branched-chain amino acid metabolism.,"It has been hypothesized that a greater decline in circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) after weight loss induced by Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery than after calorie restriction alone has independent effects on glucose homeostasis, possibly by decreased signaling through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). We evaluated plasma BCAAs and their C3 and C5 acylcarnitine metabolites, muscle mTOR phosphorylation, and insulin sensitivity (insulin-stimulated glucose Rd) in obese subjects before and after ~20% weight loss induced by RYGB (n = 10, BMI 45.6 Â± 6.7 kg/m(2)) or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) (n = 10, BMI 46.5 Â± 8.8 kg/m(2)). Weight loss increased insulin-stimulated glucose Rd by ~55%, decreased total plasma BCAA and C3 and C5 acylcarnitine concentrations by 20-35%, and did not alter mTOR phosphorylation; no differences were detected between surgical groups (all P values for interaction >0.05). Insulin-stimulated glucose Rd correlated negatively with plasma BCAAs and with C3 and C5 acylcarnitine concentrations (r values -0.56 to -0.75, P < 0.05). These data demonstrate that weight loss induced by either LAGB or RYGB causes the same decline in circulating BCAAs and their C3 and C5 acylcarnitine metabolites. Plasma BCAA concentration is negatively associated with skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity, but the mechanism(s) responsible for this relationship is not known.",10.2337/db13-0185,,,,1352
1277,"Visceral fat resection in humans: effect on insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, adipokines, and inflammatory markers.","The visceral fat is linked to insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and an increased cardiovascular risk, but it is not clear whether it has a causative role. Surgical resection of this fat depot is a research model to address this issue. Twenty premenopausal women with metabolic syndrome and grade III obesity were randomized to undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) either alone or combined with omentectomy. Insulin sensitivity (IS; euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp), acute insulin response to glucose (AIR; intravenous glucose tolerance test), disposition index (DI = AIR Ã— IS measured by clamp), lipid profile, adipokine profile (leptin, adiponectin, resistin, visfatin, interleukin-6, TNF-Î±, MCP-1), ultra-sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP), body composition, and abdominal fat echography were assessed prior to surgery and 1, 6, and 12 months post-surgery. Omentectomy was associated with greater weight loss at all time points. IS improved similarly in both groups. Omentectomy was associated to lower CRP after 12 months, but it did not influence adipokines and other metabolic parameters. Among non-diabetic subjects, omentectomy was associated with a preservation of baseline AIR after 12 months (as opposed to deterioration in the control group) and a greater DI after 6 and 12 months. Although omentectomy did not enhance the effect of RYGBP on insulin sensitivity and adipokines, it was associated with a preservation of insulin secretion, a greater weight loss, and lower CRP.",10.1002/oby.20030,,,,1353
914,Critical role for GLP-1 in symptomatic post-bariatric hypoglycaemia.,"Post-bariatric hypoglycaemia (PBH) is a rare, but severe, metabolic disorder arising months to years after bariatric surgery. It is characterised by symptomatic postprandial hypoglycaemia, with inappropriately elevated insulin concentrations. The relative contribution of exaggerated incretin hormone signalling to dysregulated insulin secretion and symptomatic hypoglycaemia is a subject of ongoing inquiry. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that PBH and associated symptoms are primarily mediated by glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). We conducted a double-blinded crossover study wherein eight participants with confirmed PBH were assigned in random order to intravenous infusion of the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1r) antagonist. Exendin (9-39) (Ex-9), or placebo during an OGTT on two separate days at the Stanford University Clinical and Translational Research Unit. Metabolic, symptomatic and pharmacokinetic variables were evaluated. Results were compared with a cohort of BMI- and glucose-matched non-surgical controls (NSCs). Infusion of Ex-9 decreased the time to peak glucose and rate of glucose decline during OGTT, and raised the postprandial nadir by over 70%, normalising it relative to NSCs and preventing hypoglycaemia in all PBH participants. Insulin AUC and secretion rate decreased by 57% and 71% respectively, and peak postprandial insulin was normalised relative to NSCs. Autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms were significantly reduced during Ex-9 infusion. GLP-1r blockade prevented hypoglycaemia in 100% of individuals, normalised beta cell function and reversed neuroglycopenic symptoms, supporting the conclusion that GLP-1 plays a primary role in mediating hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia in PBH. Competitive antagonism at the GLP-1r merits consideration as a therapeutic strategy. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02550145.",10.1007/s00125-016-4179-x,,,,1354
635,"Safety of radiofrequency ablation in patients with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer: A phase II study.","Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been proposed as a new treatment option for locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer (LAPC). In preparation of a randomized controlled trial (RCT), the aim of this phase II study was to assess the safety of RFA for patients with LAPC. Patients diagnosed with LAPC confirmed during surgical exploration between November 2012 and April 2014 were eligible for inclusion. RFA probes were placed under ultrasound guidance with a safety margin of at least 10â€¯mm from the duodenum and 15â€¯mm from the portomesenteric vessels. During RFA, the duodenum was continuously perfused with cold saline to reduce risk for thermal damage. Primary outcome was defined as the amount of major complications (Clavien-Dindo gradeâ€¯â‰¥III). RFA-related complications were predefined as: pancreatic fistula, pancreatitis, thermal damage to the portomesenteric vessels and duodenal perforation. In total, 17 patients underwent RFA. Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) requiring endoscopic feeding tube placement occurred in 4 patients (24%) as only major complication. Five patients (29%) had a major complication other than DGE. One (6%) RFA-related major complications occurred. One patient (6%) died due to complications from a biliary leak following hepaticojejunostomy. After evaluation of the first 5 patients, gastrojejunostomy was no longer performed routinely. Since then severe DGE seemed to occur less (3/5 vs. 3/12 grade C DGE). RFA is a major, but safe procedure for patients with LAPC if performed with strict predefined safety criteria. A RCT is currently investigating the true effectiveness of RFA in patients with LAPC.",10.1016/j.ejso.2019.06.008,,,,1355
1206,Gastrojejunostomy in patients with unresectable pancreatic head cancer - the use of Roux loop significantly shortens the hospital length of stay.,"To evaluate the use of the Roux loop on the postoperative course in patients submitted for gastroenteroanastomosis (GE). Non-jaundiced patients (n = 41) operated on in the Department of General and Transplant Surgery in Lodz, between January 2010 and December 2011 were enrolled. The tumor was considered unresectable when liver metastases or major vascular involvement were confirmed. Patients were randomized to receive Roux (n = 21) or conventional GE (n = 20) on a prophylactic basis. The mean time to nasogastric tube withdrawal in Roux GE group was shorter (1.4 Â± 0.75 vs 2.8 Â± 1.1, P < 0.001). Time to starting oral liquids, soft diet and regular diet were decreased (2.3 Â± 0.86 vs 3.45 Â± 1.19; P < 0.001; 3.3 Â± 0.73 vs 4.4 Â± 1.23, P < 0.001 and 4.5 Â± 0.76 vs 5.6 Â± 1.42, P = 0.002; respectively). The Roux GE group had a lower use of prokinetics (10 mg thrice daily for 2.2 Â± 1.8 d vs 3.7 Â± 2.6 d, P = 0.044; total 62 Â± 49 mg vs 111 Â± 79 mg, P = 0.025). The mean hospitalization time following Roux GE was shorter (7.7 d vs 9.6 d, P = 0.006). Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) was confirmed in 20% after conventional GE but in none of the patients following Roux GE. Roux gastrojejunostomy during open abdomen exploration in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer is easy to perform, decreases the incidence of DGE and lowers hospitalization time.",10.3748/wjg.v19.i45.8321,,,,1356
265,Changes in volumetric bone mineral density and bone quality after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: A meta-analysis with meta-regression.,"This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on three-dimensionally assessed volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) with the effect of time on these changes, on bone quality, and the agreement of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) with quantitative computed tomography (QCT) or high-resolution peripheral QCT (HR-pQCT) estimates of bone loss. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, Scopus, and EBSCO. Longitudinal studies on adults undergoing RYGB in which vBMD was assessed by QCT or HR-pQCT with â‰¥6â€‰months follow-up were included. Total hip (TH) changes were reported in four studies, lumbar spine (LS) in eight, radius in eight, and tibia in seven. Significant post-RYGB vBMD reductions occurred at all skeletal sites analyzed. Meta-regression revealed that time post-RYGB was significantly associated with vBMD deterioration in all skeletal sites except at the TH. RYGB also led to significant deterioration on bone quality. DXA underestimated LS and overestimated TH bone losses post-RYGB. In conclusion, RYGB was associated with significant vBMD loss, which makes screening of bone mass progression by three-dimensional technology a crucial clinical issue to prevent fracture risk and osteoporosis.",10.1111/obr.13479,,,,1357

This systematic review aims to evaluate the incidence, cause, treatment, and outcome of ChP and ChT after bariatric surgery. This review investigates published English language scientific literature systematically in an attempt to answer these questions. Our literature search revealed 66 studies, of which 23 were included. There were a total of 40 patients (38, ChP; 2, ChT). Eighteen of 40 (43.9%) patients were treated laparoscopically, and one patient (2.44%) underwent thoracoscopy and ligation of the thoracic duct.

1514,Once-daily insulin glargine versus 6-hour sliding scale regular insulin for control of hyperglycemia after a bariatric surgical procedure: a randomized clinical trial.,"To determine whether once-daily insulin glargine could provide better glycemic control after an abdominal surgical procedure than the traditional use of sliding scale regular insulin (SSRI). Because 20% to 30% of patients undergoing gastric bypass have a history of overt diabetes and another 5% to 10% are estimated to have impaired glucose tolerance, we chose to study these patients. We treated 81 patients with postoperative blood glucose levels of more than 144 mg/dL after a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgical procedure. They were randomized to receive either SSRI or insulin glargine either directly or after initial intravenous insulin infusion in the intensive care unit (ICU). Overall, the mean blood glucose level after SSRI therapy was 154 +/- 33 mg/dL, and the mean blood glucose value after insulin glargine treatment was 134 +/- 30 mg/dL (P<0.01). The mean blood glucose level for patients first treated with intravenous insulin infusion in the ICU was 125 mg/dL, in comparison with 145 mg/dL in the non-ICU patients whose treatment began directly with 0.3 U/kg of insulin glargine. Of 926 blood glucose measurements, only 3 were less than 60 mg/dL. In this study, control of postoperative hyperglycemia was significantly better with use of insulin glargine in comparison with SSRI therapy, and hypoglycemia was very infrequent.",10.4158/EP.13.3.225,,,,1359

We review the diagnosis and treatment of dysautonomia after bariatric surgery and the limited treatment options available. We summarize the suggested mechanisms and explain why a complete understanding of the etiology has yet to be determined. In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review was performed. Of 448 studies identified in the literature search, 4 studies were reviewed, describing 87 patients diagnosed with dysautonomia. We present a patient who developed severe dysautonomia following conversion of sleeve gastrectomy to gastric bypass. Treatment needs to focus on optimizing nutrition, avoiding hypoglycemia, and optimizing volume status.",10.1007/s11695-022-05960-x,,,,1360
75,Healthcare payment mechanism: Execution results of bundled payment program for bariatric surgery diagnosis in its first year of implementation in Chile.,"More than 600 thousand people in Chile live with morbid obesity. Effective, safe, cost-effective therapeutic interventions are critical for healthcare systems and insurance schemes. In 2022, two bundled payment codes for bariatric surgery (gastric bypass and gastric sleeve) were incorporated into the National Health Fund's free-choice modality fee scheme. The objective was to characterize the execution of this payment mechanism program associated with bariatric surgery diagnosis in its first year of implementation.More than six hundred thousand people in Chile are estimated to live with morbid obesity. Effective, safe, cost-effective therapeutic interventions are critical for health systems and insurance schemes. In 2022, FONASA incorporated two Bariatric Surgery codes into the Free Choice Modality: Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy. Our objective was to characterize the execution of the Bariatric Surgery Bundled Payment Program in its first year of implementation. Descriptive and observational study of the pragmatic approach of the national execution of the payment associated with diagnosis in bariatric surgery. We examined sociodemographic variables (sex, age brackets, and National Health Fund tranches) and characterization of surgeries by code broken down by public or private provider, period of issue, unit cost, co-payment, and medical loans between March and December 2022. We recorded n = 13 118 surgeries (45.81% bypass versus 54.19% sleeve), of which n = 2424 (18.48%) used medical loans. A total of 85.01% (p = 0.01) of the procedures were in women, in people between 35 and 39 years of age (20.15%), and 45.12% in beneficiaries of tranche B. Private providers performed a total of 99.21% of the surgeries. Ten accounted for 50% of the activity (range n = 1200 to 426 surgeries per year; n = 4.8 to 1.7 surgeries per working day). Total program expenditure was $71 626 948 350 CLP, accounting for 5.04% of the total activity of the national Diagnosis Associated Payment Program. The implementation of this bariatric surgery voucher benefited more than 13 thousand people living with obesity, mostly women of productive ages and with purchasing capacity. As an equity strategy, regardless of the access route through the voucher, it will be important to safeguard the activity in the public network.",10.5867/medwave.2024.01.2762,,,,1361
532,Postprandial Hypoglycemia in Patients after Gastric Bypass Surgery Is Mediated by Glucose-Induced IL-1Î².,"Postprandial hypoglycemia is a disabling complication of the treatment of obesity by gastric bypass surgery. So far, no therapy exists, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we hypothesized that glucose-induced IL-1Î² leads to an exaggerated insulin response in this condition. Therefore, we conducted a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover study with the SGLT2-inhibitor empagliflozin and the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra (clinicaltrials.govNCT03200782; nÂ = 12). Both drugs reduced postprandial insulin release and prevented hypoglycemia (symptomatic events requiring rescue glucose: placeboÂ = 7/12, empagliflozinÂ = 2/12, and anakinraÂ = 2/12, pvallikelihood ratio test (LRT) = 0.013; nadir blood glucose for placeboÂ = 2.4Â mmol/L, 95% CIÂ 2.18-2.62, empagliflozinÂ = 2.69Â mmol/L, 95% CI 2.31-3.08, and anakinraÂ = 2.99Â mmol/L, 95% CI 2.43-3.55, pvalLRTÂ = 0.048). Moreover, analysis of monocytes exÂ vivo revealed a hyper-reactive inflammatory state that has features of an exaggerated response to a meal. Our study proposes a role for glucose-induced IL-1Î² in postprandial hypoglycemia after gastric bypass surgery and suggests that SGLT2-inhibitors and IL-1 antagonism may improve this condition.",10.1016/j.cmet.2020.02.013,,,,1362
540,Economic evaluation of surgical treatment of obesity.,"Obesity surgery is the best treatment for extreme obesity, with demonstrated long-term positive outcomes. The potential cost-savings generated by the improvement of comorbidities after surgery can justify the allocation of more resources in the surgical treatment of obesity. This was an observational, descriptive, longitudinal and retrospective study. Eligible patients underwent Roux-en-YÂ gastric bypass surgery at the Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias between 2003 and 2012. The established minimum follow-up period was two years. We calculated the individualized cost per patient treated (bottom-up) as well as per Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) codes (top-down). Our study included 307 patients. The average cost per hospitalization calculated by DRG codes was â‚¬6,545.90, and the average cost per patient was â‚¬10,572.20. DRG 288 represented 91% of the series, with a value of â‚¬4,631. The number of medications also decreased during this period, from 2.86 to 0.78 per medically treated patient, representing a cost reduction of â‚¬4,433 per patient with all the obesity-related comorbidities analyzed. Two years after Roux-en-YÂ gastric bypassÂ conducted at Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, the savings in drug costs for patients with multiple pathologies would compensate the inherent costs of the surgical treatment itself. Our results showed that DRG-related costs was insufficient to make a correct economic evaluation, so we recommend an individualized cost calculating method.",10.1016/j.ciresp.2020.01.001,,,,1363
1070,Post-Gastric Bypass Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia: Fructose is a Carbohydrate Which Can Be Safely Consumed.,"Postprandial hypoglycemia after gastric bypass surgery is a serious problem. Available treatments are often ineffective. The objective was to test the hypotheses that injection of rapid-acting insulin before a high-carbohydrate meal or replacement of other carbohydrates with fructose in the meal would prevent hypoglycemia. This was a randomized, crossover trial comparing a high-carbohydrate meal with premeal saline injection (control), a high-carbohydrate meal with premeal insulin injection, and a high-fructose meal with total carbohydrate content similar to the control meal. The setting was an academic medical center. Ten patients with post-gastric bypass hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia participated. Interventions included lispro insulin injected before test meals and replacement of other carbohydrates with fructose in test meals. The main outcome measure was plasma glucose < 60 mg/dL after test meals. After the control meal, mean peak glucose and insulin were 173 Â± 47 mg/dL and 134 Â± 55 mU/L, respectively; mean glucose nadir was 44 Â± 15 mg/dL; and eight of 10 subjects demonstrated glucose < 60 mg/dL. Five subjects demonstrated a glucose nadir < 40 mg/dL. There were no significant differences in the corresponding values after premeal insulin treatment, except that the mean glucose nadir of 34 Â± 10 mg/dL was lower (P < .05). After the fructose meal, mean peak postprandial glucose and insulin were 117 Â± 20 mg/dL and 45 Â± 31 mU/L, respectively (both P < .001 for comparison with control), mean glucose nadir was 67 Â± 10 mg/dL (P < .001), and two of 10 subjects demonstrated glucose < 60 mg/dL (P < .05). People with post-gastric bypass hypoglycemia can consume a meal sweetened with fructose with little risk of hypoglycemia. Treatment with rapid-acting insulin before a carbohydrate-containing meal did not prevent hypoglycemia.",10.1210/jc.2015-1283,,,,1364
48,Short-term effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or gastric sleeve on bone mineral density and calciotropic hormones: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and gastric sleeve (GS) have been associated with significant reductions in bone mineral density (BMD) and fluctuations in serum levels of calciotropic hormones. These changes pose a risk to bone health. The study assessed the short-term (12 and 24 months) effects of RYGB and GS on BMD and calciotropic hormones. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. Analyses considered follow-up (12 and 24 months) with BMD as main outcome at three sites (femoral neck, total hip, and lumbar spine) and one for each calciotropic hormone (25 OH vitamin D and parathyroid hormone [PTH]). Estimated effect sizes were calculated as standardized mean differences (SMD), confidence interval of 95%, and P value. Nine studies totaling 473 participants (RYGB = 261 and GS = 212) were included. RYGB resulted in lower BMD than GS at 12 months for femoral neck (SMD = -0.485, 95% CI [-0.768, -0.202], P = .001), lumbar spine (SMD = -0.471, 95% CI [-0.851, -0.092], P = .015), and total hip (SMD = -0.616, 95% CI [-0.972, -0.259], P = .001), and at 24 months for total hip (SMD = -0.572, 95% CI [-0.907, -0.238], P = .001). At 24 months, 25 OH vitamin D was lower in RYGB than GS (SMD = -0.958 [-1.670, -0.245], P = .008) and PTH levels were higher in RYGB than in GS (SMD = 0.968 [0.132, 1.804, P = .023]). RYGB demonstrated significant reduction in regional BMD. It also induces lower serum 25 OH vitamin D and higher PTH levels than GS. The results support the need for preventive bone health measures in the short-term postoperative period, especially in the case of RYGB.",10.1016/j.soard.2024.03.007,,,,1365
1091,Comprehensive Surgical Coaching Enhances Surgical Skill in the Operating Room: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"The aim of the study was to determine whether individualized coaching improved surgical technical skill in the operating room to a higher degree than current residency training. Clinical training in the operating room is a valuable opportunity for surgeons to acquire skill and knowledge; however, it often remains underutilized. Coaching has been successfully used in various industries to enhance performance, but its role in surgery has been insufficiently investigated. This randomized controlled trial was conducted at one surgical training program. Trainees undergoing a minimally invasive surgery rotation were randomized to either conventional training (CT) or comprehensive surgical coaching (CSC). CT included ward and operating room duties, and regular departmental teaching sessions. CSC comprised performance analysis, debriefing, feedback, and behavior modeling. Primary outcome measures were technical performance as measured on global and procedure-specific rating scales, and surgical safety parameters, measured by error count. Operative performance was assessed by blinded video analysis of the first and last cases recorded by the participants during their rotation. Twenty residents were randomized and 18 completed the study. At posttraining the CSC group (n = 9) scored significantly higher on a procedure-specific skill scale compared with the CT group (n = 9) [median, 3.90 (interquartile range, 3.68-4.30) vs 3.60 (2.98-3.70), P = 0.017], and made fewer technical errors [10 (7-13) vs 18 (13-21), P = 0.003].

1242,Postprandial metabolite profiles reveal differential nutrient handling after bariatric surgery compared with matched caloric restriction.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery results in exaggerated postprandial insulin and incretin responses and increased susceptibility to hypoglycemia. We examined whether these features are due to caloric restriction (CR) or altered nutrient handling. We performed comprehensive analysis of postprandial metabolite responses during a 2-hour mixed-meal tolerance (MMT) test in 20 morbidly obese subjects with type 2 diabetes who underwent RYGB surgery or matched CR. Acylcarnitines and amino acids (AAs) were measured using targeted mass spectrometry. A linear mixed model was used to determine the main effect of interventions and interaction term to assess the effect of interventions on postprandial kinetics. Two weeks after these interventions, several gut hormones (insulin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, and glucagon-like peptide 1), glucose, and multiple AAs, including branched-chain and aromatic species, exhibited a more rapid rate of appearance and clearance in RYGB surgery subjects than in CR subjects during the MMT test. In the RYGB surgery group, changes in leucine/isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, and glucagon-like peptide 1 response were associated with changes in insulin response. Levels of alanine, pyruvate, and lactate decreased significantly at the later stages of meal challenge in RYGB surgery subjects but increased with CR. RYGB surgery results in improved metabolic flexibility (ie, greater disposal of glucose and AAs and more complete Î²-oxidation of fatty acids) compared with CR. The changes in the AA kinetics may augment the hormonal responses seen after RYGB surgery. The reduction in key gluconeogenic substrates in the postprandial state may contribute to increased susceptibility to hypoglycemic symptoms in RYGB surgery subjects.",10.1097/SLA.0b013e318296633f,,,,1367
672,Four Weeks of Preoperative Omega-3 Fatty Acids Reduce Liver Volume: a Randomised Controlled Trial.,"Weight loss before bariatric surgery with a low-calorie diet (LCD) has several advantages, including reduction of liver volume and an improved access to the lesser sac. Disadvantages include performing surgery in a state of undernutrition, side effects, costs and patient compliance. Omega-3 fatty acids may serve as an alternative to reduce liver steatosis. A randomised controlled open-label trial was done to compare the effects of a LCD with Modifast (800Â kcal/day) during 2Â weeks with 2Â g of omega-3 fatty acids a day and a normal diet (2000Â kcal/day) during 4Â weeks. Total liver volume (TLV) and volume of the left liver lobe (LLL), visceral fat area (VFA) and muscle area (SMA) at the L3-L4 level were measured with MRI before and after preoperative treatment. Sixty-two morbidly obese women undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (LRYGB) were recruited. In both groups, there was a significant decrease in LLL, TLV and VFA. For LLL and TLV reduction, the LCD had a significantly larger effect (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Only in the LCD group was there a significant decrease in SMA with significantly more side effects and worse compliance. Both the LCD and omega-3 diet reduced LLL, TLV and VFA. The LCD outperformed the omega-3 diet in LLL and TLV reduction, but induced significant loss of SMA and had worse compliance due to more side effects. Omega-3 fatty acids may provide a safe and more patient-friendly alternative for a LCD and further research is indicated. The study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02206256).",10.1007/s11695-019-03814-7,,,,1368
1576,The efficacy of fibrin sealant in prevention of anastomotic leak after laparoscopic gastric bypass.,"Anastomotic leak after laparoscopic gastric bypass (GBP) can result in significant morbidity, mortality, and consumption of healthcare resources. Fibrin sealant has been used clinically in the prevention of leak; however, its efficacy has not been clearly demonstrated. The aims of this study were to (1) develop an iatrogenic leak model in swine, (2) examine the efficacy of fibrin sealant in sealing iatrogenic anastomotic leak, and (3) review our experience with the use of fibrin sealant in 66 patients who underwent laparoscopic GBP. This study was performed in three phases. In phase 1, laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy was performed in adult swine with iatrogenic disruption of the anastomotic staple line. The size of disruption was sequentially increased (6- to 12-F opening) until a leak model was developed. In phase 2, 16 animals underwent laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy with a 12-F disruption of the anastomosis; 10 animals (study group) had fibrin sealant (Tisseel VH) applied on the disrupted anastomosis and 6 animals (control group) did not receive fibrin sealant. Animals were sacrificed on postoperative day 5 or earlier if peritonitis developed and were examined for sealing of the anastomotic disruption and the presence of intraabdominal abscess. In phase 3, the outcome of 66 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic GBP with fibrin sealant applied at the gastrojejunostomy was reviewed. In phase 1, an anastomotic leak model was developed with a 12-F disruption of the staple line. In phase 2, two control animals required early sacrifice for bile peritonitis; three control animals had intraabdominal abscess discovered at sacrifice and one animal did not have any evidence of intraabdominal abscess or leak. Of the 10 animals in the study group, all survived until sacrifice and none of these animals had evidence of intraabdominal abscess or persistent leak. Therefore, 83% of animals in the control group developed either leak or abscess compared to 0% in the study group (P < 0.01, Fisher's exact test). Clinically, no leak or intraabdominal abscess developed in 66 patients who underwent laparoscopic GBP with the use of fibrin sealant. An anastomotic leak model was developed in swine with disruption of the stapled gastrojejunostomy to a 12-F opening. The use of fibrin sealant significantly reduces leak and abscess complication. Our results support the tissue sealing property of fibrin sealant and its use on high-risk gastrointestinal anastomosis.",10.1016/j.jss.2004.05.005,,,,1369
1252,Calorie restriction is a major determinant of the short-term metabolic effects of gastric bypass surgery in obese type 2 diabetic patients.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and restrictive weight loss interventions, such as gastric banding (GB) and very-low-calorie diets (VLCD) directly impact glucose metabolism, possibly by calorie restriction and/or altered secretion of gut hormones. We aimed to establish the direct endocrine and metabolic effects of RYGB compared to restrictive interventions in obese glucose-tolerant (NGT) subjects and subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Controlled, nonrandomized observational trial. Four groups of obese females received a mixed meal at baseline and 3 weeks after intervention; NGT-GB (n = 11), NGT-RYGB (n = 16), T2DM-RYGB (n = 15) and T2DM-VLCD (n = 12). Normal weight controls (n = 12) were studied once. At baseline, all obese subjects were hyperinsulinemic. T2DM was associated with hyperglycaemia and decreased GLP-1 levels. RYGB and VLCD reduced glucose levels to a similar extent in T2DM, insulin levels decreased only after VLCD. Comparison of restrictive intervention vs RYGB showed a more pronounced decrease in glucose and insulin AUC after restriction. In NGT and T2DM subjects, RYGB increased GLP-1 and PYY levels and decreased ghrelin levels, whereas VLCD and GB only increased GIP levels. These data indicate that deterioration of glucose metabolism in T2DM is associated with a decline of GLP-1 levels. Calorie restriction facilitates glucose metabolism and blunts hyperinsulinemia in obese (diabetic) humans. Additional duodenal exclusion through RYGB induces gut hormone release and hyperinsulinemia but does not improve postprandial glucose levels any further. Our data thus strongly suggest that calorie restriction underlies the short-term metabolic benefits of RYGB in obese T2DM patients.",10.1111/cen.12254,,,,1370
1588,Health-related quality-of-life in patients with morbid obesity after gastric banding for surgically induced weight loss.,"Physical, emotional, and social functioning are impaired in obesity. It is unknown whether and, if so, to what extent and in which domain obese subjects who lose weight may catch up to normal-weight levels. Our objective was to compare the health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) of obese subjects with that of a normal-weight reference group before and 1 year after a weight loss program that centered around laparoscopic and open gastric banding. An HRQL questionnaire consisting of a battery of both generic and specific measures was administered to 50 morbidly obese subjects on 2 occasions and to 100 healthy, normal-weight subjects, matched for age, gender, education, and vocational training. In addition to weight loss and health gain, the influences of achieved weight loss goals, satisfaction with outcome and operative approach (laparoscopy/laparotomy) were assessed. Quality-of-life was significantly impaired in obese subjects. With a substantial weight loss of 35 kg and 42% loss of excessive weight, and correction of disturbed metabolic parameters, they significantly improved in general well-being, health distress, and perceived attractiveness, approaching halfway the values of a normal-weight reference group. Improvement in values for depression and self-regard lagged behind. In physical activity, they bypassed the reference group. Days of sick leave decreased to the level of the reference group. Improvements in HRQL paralleled the rate of weight loss. Personal satisfaction and surgical approach were of minor influence. The obese subjects' impaired physical and social functioning improved considerably, catching up midway to normal-weight reference values after weight loss. Psychologic amelioration lagged behind. Whether the latter will catch up later and physical/social improvements will be maintained is the subject of further studies.",10.1016/j.surg.2004.01.007,,,,1371

1281,Weight loss independently predicts urinary albumin excretion normalization in morbidly obese type 2 diabetic patients undergoing bariatric surgery.,"Despite obesity being closely associated with two common risk factors for albuminuria, namely type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension, information on the impact of weight loss on albumin excretion rate in morbidly obese (MO) subjects is scarce. To evaluate the independent contribution of weight loss following bariatric surgery (BS) to the improvement of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in MO subjects with T2DM. Observational prospective study, including consecutive (n = 255) patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GBP) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) of whom 37.6 % (n = 96) presented with T2DM. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to assess the contribution of T2DM-related, hypertension-related, and weight loss-related variables, and type of surgery to normalization of ACR (<30 mg/g) at 12 and 24 months follow-up. In T2DM subjects, baseline ACR was 85.7 Â± 171 mg/g with ACR â‰¥ 30 mg/g being present in 45.7 % of the cohort. At 12 months, the ACR significantly decreased in T2DM subjects (42.2 Â± 142.8 mg/g; p < 0.005) with no further reduction at 24 months after surgery (44.4 Â± 227.7; p = 0.862). Among T2DM subjects with ACR â‰¥ 30 mg/g at baseline, the ACR became <30 mg/g in 58.5 % and 76.9 % at 12 and 24 months, respectively (p < 0.001 relative to baseline). Body mass index (BMI) change from baseline was the only independent predictor of ACR normalization at 12 months [Exp(B) 1.373, 95 % confidence interval 1.075-1.703; p < 0.05]. None of the evaluated variables appeared as an independent predictor of ACR normalization at 24 months. Our data suggest that, in MO subjects with T2DM, interventions aiming at slowing the progression of nephropathy should not only focus on optimization of glucose and blood pressure control but also include effective weight loss strategies.",10.1007/s00464-012-2708-3,,,,1373
489,Fecal metagenomics and metabolomics reveal gut microbial changes after bariatric surgery.,"Evidence from longitudinal patient studies regarding gut microbial changes after bariatric surgery is limited. To examine intraindividual changes in fecal microbiome and metabolites among patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or vertical sleeve gastrectomy. Observational study. Twenty patients were enrolled and provided stool samples before and 1 week, 1 month, and/or 3 months after surgery. Shallow shotgun metagenomics and untargeted fecal metabolomics were performed. Zero-inflated generalized additive models and linear mixed models were applied to identify fecal microbiome and metabolites changes, with adjustment for potential confounders and correction for multiple testing. We enrolled 16 women and 4 men, including 16 white and 4 black participants (median age = 45 years; presurgery body mass index = 47.7 kg/m2). Ten patients had Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 10 had vertical sleeve gastrectomy, and 14 patients provided postsurgery stool samples. Of 47 samples, median sequencing depth was 6.3 million reads and 1073 metabolites were identified. Microbiome alpha-diversity increased after surgery, especially at 3 months. Significant genus-level changes included increases in Odoribacter, Streptococcus, Anaerotruncus, Alistipes, Klebsiella, and Bifidobacterium, while decreases in Bacteroides, Coprocosccus, Dorea, and Faecalibacterium. Large increases in Streptococcus, Akkermansia, and Prevotella were observed at 3 months. Beta-diversity and fecal metabolites were also changed, including reduced caffeine metabolites, indoles, and butyrate. Despite small sample size and missing repeated samples in some participants, our pilot study showed significant postsurgery changes in fecal microbiome and metabolites among bariatric surgery patients. Future large-scale, longitudinal studies are warranted to investigate gut microbial changes and their associations with metabolic outcomes after bariatric surgery.",10.1016/j.soard.2020.06.032,,,,1374
456,Identification and Metabolic Profiling of a Novel Human Gut-derived LEAP2 Fragment.,"The mechanisms underlying Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery-induced weight loss and the immediate postoperative beneficial metabolic effects associated with the operation remain uncertain. Enteroendocrine cell (EEC) secretory function has been proposed as a key factor in the marked metabolic benefits from RYGB surgery. To identify novel gut-derived peptides with therapeutic potential in obesity and/or diabetes by profiling EEC-specific molecular changes in obese patients following RYGB-induced weight loss. Genome-wide expression analysis was performed in isolated human small intestinal EECs obtained from 20 gut-biopsied obese subjects before and after RYGB. Targets of interest were profiled for preclinical and clinical metabolic effects. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass consistently increased expression levels of the inverse ghrelin receptor agonist, liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP2). A secreted endogenous LEAP2 fragment (LEAP238-47) demonstrated robust insulinotropic properties, stimulating insulin release in human pancreatic islets comparable to the gut hormone glucagon-like peptide-1. LEAP238-47 showed reciprocal effects on growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) activity, suggesting that the insulinotropic action of the peptide may be directly linked to attenuation of tonic GHSR activity. The fragment was infused in healthy human individuals (n = 10), but no glucoregulatory effect was observed in the chosen dose as compared to placebo. Small intestinal LEAP2 expression was upregulated after RYGB. The corresponding circulating LEAP238-47 fragment demonstrated strong insulinotropic action in vitro but failed to elicit glucoregulatory effects in healthy human subjects.",10.1210/clinem/dgaa803,,,,1375
286,Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy induce substantial and persistent changes in microbial communities and metabolic pathways.,"Bariatric surgery induces significant microbial and metabolomic changes, however, links between microbial and metabolic pathways have not been fully elucidated. The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the microbial, metabolomic, and inflammatory changes that occur following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). A prospective clinical trial was conducted with participants undergoing RYGB, SG, and non-operative controls (CTRL). Clinical parameters, blood samples, and fecal samples were collected pre-intervention and at 3 and 9 months. A multi-omics approach was used to perform integrated microbial-metabolomic analysis to identify functional pathways in which weight loss and metabolic changes occur after surgery. RYGB led to profound microbial changes over time that included reductions in alpha-diversity, increased Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobiota, decreased Firmicutes, and numerous changes at the genera level. These changes were associated with a reduction in inflammation and significant weight loss. A reduction in Romboutsia genera correlated strongly with weight loss and integrated microbial-metabolomic analysis revealed the importance of Romboutsia. Its obliteration correlated with improved weight loss and insulin resistance, possibly through decreases in glycerophospholipids. In contrast, SG was associated with no changes in alpha-diversity, and only a small number of changes in microbial genera. A cluster of Firmicutes genera including Butyriciccocus, Eubacterium ventriosum, and Monoglobus was decreased, which correlated with decreased weight, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation. This work represents comprehensive analyses of microbial-metabolomic changes that occur following bariatric surgery and identifies several pathways that are associated with beneficial metabolic effects of surgery.",10.1080/19490976.2022.2050636,,,,1376
71,Long-term changes in lung function after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in patients with severe obesity.,"Obesity can decrease the lung function. The proposed mechanisms of reduced lung function in persons with obesity have been altered mechanical properties in the lung and chest wall, airway narrowing and increased respiratory resistance. The aim of this current study was to analyse the long-term results after gastric bypass surgery in patients with reduced lung function. The bariatric surgery observation study invited patients to a follow up 10â€‰years after gastric bypass surgery. We compared the spirometry results before surgery to the spirometry 10â€‰years after surgery. Thirty percent of 198 participants had reduced lung function before surgery. There was no significant relation between body mass index before surgery and lung function. Seventy-three percent of the participants with reduced lung function had normal lung function 10â€‰years after surgery. There was no significant relation between the degree of weight loss and the improvement in lung function. Most participants with reduced lung function had normal lung function 10â€‰years after gastric bypass surgery. There was no significant correlation between weight loss and improvement in lung function.",10.1111/cob.12640,,,,1377
528,Comparison of methodological approaches to human gut microbiota changes in response to metabolic and bariatric surgery: A systematic review.,"Substantial differences in the response of gut microbial composition to metabolic and bariatric surgery have been reported. Therefore, the goal of the present review is to evaluate if methodological differences could be driving this lack of consistency. A search was conducted using PUBMED, Web of Science, Science Direct and COCHRANE using the following inclusion criteria: human studies written in English with a baseline sampling point, using gut microbiota as an outcome and either Roux-n-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. Sixteen articles were selected (total 221 participants). Roux-n-Y gastric bypass caused more alterations in gut microbial composition in comparison with sleeve gastrectomy. Substantial variability was found in study designs, data collection and analyses across studies. Increases in several families and genera from the phylum Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, the family Streptococcaceae, the species Akkermansia muciniphila and Streptococcus salivarius and a decrease in the phylum Firmicutes and the family Bifidobacteriaceae were reported. There is a need for standardization not only of microbial analysis but also of study designs when analysing the effect of bariatric surgery on the human gut microbiome. In addition, outcomes from different surgical procedures should not be combined as they produce distinctive effects on gut microbial composition.",10.1111/obr.13025,,,,1378
1130,Intrahepatic fat content correlates with soluble CD163 in relation to weight loss induced by Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Soluble CD163 (sCD163) is a new marker of obesity-related metabolic complications. sCD163 and CD163 mRNA were investigated in relation to the fat distribution at baseline and 12 months after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Thirty-one obese subjects (BMI: 42.3â€‰Â±â€‰4.7 kg/m(2)) were enrolled. Subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) volume were determined by MRI, intrahepatic lipid content (IHL) by MR-spectroscopy, and body composition by DXA. Fasting blood samples and adipose tissue samples were obtained, and ELISA and RT-PCR were performed. RYGB-induced weight loss (36â€‰Â±â€‰11 kg) was accompanied by a significant reduction in sCD163 (2.1â€‰Â±â€‰0.8 mg/l vs. 1.7â€‰Â±â€‰0.7 mg/l), SAT, VAT, and IHL (all, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). At baseline, sCD163 was associated with VAT (râ€‰=â€‰0.40, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) but not with SAT or IHL. Moreover, CD163 mRNA was significantly upregulated in VAT compared with SAT at baseline (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) and significantly downregulated in SAT after RYGB (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Î”sCD163 was significantly associated with Î”IHL after RYGB compared with baseline (râ€‰=â€‰0.40, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). RYGB-induced weight loss results in a reduction of sCD163 and CD163 mRNA. The association between Î”sCD163 and Î”IHL may reflect a reduction in sCD163-producing Kupffer cells in the liver. Moreover, sCD163 may be a marker of ""unhealthy"" fat distribution in obese subjects.",10.1002/oby.20942,,,,1379
1032,Effects of Gastric Bypass and Gastric Banding on Bone Remodeling in Obese Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) leads to high-turnover bone loss, but little is known about skeletal effects of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) or mechanisms underlying bone loss after bariatric surgery. To evaluate effects of RYGB and LAGB on fasting and postprandial indices of bone remodeling. Ancillary investigation of a prospective study at 2 academic institutions. Obese adults aged 21-65 years with type 2 diabetes who underwent RYGB (n = 11) or LAGB (n = 8). Serum C-terminal telopeptide (CTX), procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), and PTH were measured during a mixed meal tolerance test at baseline, 10 days and 1 year after surgery. Changes in 25-hydroxyvitamin D, polypeptide YY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, and insulin were also assessed. Fasting CTX increased 10 days after RYGB but not LAGB (+69 Â± 23% vs +12Â±12%, P < .001), despite comparable weight loss at that time. By 1 year, fasting CTX and P1NP increased more after RYGB than LAGB (CTX +221 Â± 60% vs +15 Â± 6%, P<0.001; P1NP +93 Â± 25% vs -9 Â± 10%, P < .001) and weight loss was greater with RYGB. Changes in CTX were independent of PTH and 25-hydroxyvitamin D but were associated with increases in fasting PYY. Postprandial suppression of CTX was more pronounced after RYGB than LAGB at 10 days and 1 year postoperatively. RYGB is accompanied by early increases in fasting indices of bone remodeling, independent of weight loss or changes in PTH or 25-hydroxyvitamin D. LAGB did not affect bone markers. PYY and other enterohormonal signals may play a role in RYGB-specific skeletal changes.",10.1210/jc.2015-3437,,,,1380
1631,Energy economy hampers body weight loss after gastric bypass.,"The impact of energy economy on body weight loss was investigated in 20 obese women, submitted to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Resting energy expenditure (REE), substrate oxidation rates, plasma glucose, free fatty acid, and insulin and leptin levels were measured before and 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Predicted REE was obtained from linear regression analysis of REE and fat free mass, in a group of 85 women, whose body mass index ranged between 20 and 60 kg/m(2). The deviation from predicted REE, calculated as area under the curve (AUC) over the 12-month period for each patient, was considered as the expression of energy economy. Energy economy AUC was significantly (P: < 0.005) negatively related to the weight lost during 12 months after surgery. Energy intake, calculated from self-reported food consumption, was also expressed as AUC. Energy intake AUC showed a significant (P: < 0.002) positive correlation with weight loss. Lipid oxidation rate, also calculated as AUC, significantly correlated, negatively, with energy economy (P: < 0. 001) and, positively, with energy intake (P: < 0.002). Preoperative leptin values were significantly (P: < 0.01) linked to individual energy economy capacity. In conclusion, after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, energy economy hampers the weight loss process, probably through a low fat oxidation rate.",10.1210/jcem.85.12.7083,,,,1381
1150,Water with food intake does not influence caloric intake after gastric bypass (GBP): a cross-over trial.,"Bariatric patients seeking information meet very different recommendations on postoperative diet and eating behaviour. A reason for variability may be lack of hard evidence. A national survey on current dietary advice was conducted to serve as background for the present study on how drinking during a meal influenced caloric consumption. A standardised questionnaire was sent to all units in the Scandinavian Obesity surgery registry (SOReg) in order to obtain information regarding current diet advice after gastric bypass. Twenty-eight patients, 14 in each group, were studied either 2 months or 1 year after a standard gastric bypass (GBP). A standardised lunch was served on two separate days with or without water in randomised order. Meal and water weights were measured before and after. Hunger/satiety scores were obtained using visual analogue scales. Response rate for surgeons was low, for dieticians 75 %. No clear consensus for liquid intake during meals was found; few surgeons advised patients whether or not to drink with meals. All patients ate to full satiety. Two months post-GBP, 7/14 patients consumed more solid food when allowed drinking water; the increase in caloric consumption was not significant. One year post-GBP, 5/14 patients consumed more solid food when allowed drinking water, the difference not reaching statistical significance. Our study does not indicate that patients should refrain from drinking during meals the first year after a GBP, at least not from a caloric intake point of view.",10.1007/s11695-014-1401-0,,,,1382
1596,Prospective randomized comparison of linear staplers during laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"The development of laparoscopic linear staplers has enabled minimally invasive approaches to bariatric surgery, but there have been no comparison studies of the two current 6-row devices. We report our experience with a prospective randomized comparison of 6-row linear staplers during laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP). From January to March 2003, 100 patients were randomly assigned to undergo LRYGBP with either an Endo-GIA Universal 6-row stapler (USSC) or the ETS-Flex 6-row stapler (Ethicon). Mean preoperative BMI was 49+/-8 for 50 Endo-GIA patients, and 49+/-7 for 50 ETS-Flex patients. Parameters measured included quantity of cartridges, handles, hemoclips, estimated blood loss, misfires, OR time, postoperative leaks and bleeds, and cost. Mean follow-up was 135 days (range 90- 180). The ETS-Flex group experienced significantly more misfires (28% vs 2%, P <.001), hemoclips applied (30+/-9 vs 21+/-7, P <.001), estimated blood loss (132+/-56 vs 100+/-32 ml, P <.001) and OR time (66+/-19 vs 58+/-13 mins, P <.02) compared with the Endo-GIA group respectively. There was one postoperative leak associated with the ETS-Flex group and two postoperative bleeds with the Endo-GIA group, which were not a significant differences. The Endo-GIA group averaged $319 more per case for staple cost. While the ETS-Flex stapler was less expensive, it was associated with more technical failures requiring surgeon intervention to reduce potential patient morbidity, compared with the Endo-GIA.",10.1381/096089203322618641,,,,1383
1159,Postoperative changes in body composition--comparison of bioelectrical impedance analysis and magnetic resonance imaging in bariatric patients.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) result in a marked reduction of body fat and also visceral fat (VF) decrease up to 36 % in 16 weeks. This leads to positive effects on cardiometabolic risks, which are known to be correlated with the occurrence of VF. This study analyzed the validity of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) for determining VF in the postoperative course. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for prediction of whole VF in bariatric patients on the basis of a single slice. Eighteen patients, who underwent RYGB (18), were included in this study. MRI and BIA measurements were performed 1 day before surgery, as well as 6, 12, and 24 weeks after surgery. During the postoperative observation period, we found a significant decrease of both subcutaneous fat (SF) and VF. SF measured by MRI was highly correlated with the level of body fat shown by BIA. In contrast, the VF volume, as determined by MRI, showed no correlation with the body fat measured by BIA. In addition, we were able to show a significant correlation between MRI measured VF volume and the particular single-layer fat area. Compared to the widely used bioelectrical impedance analysis to measure changes in body composition after bariatric procedures, a single-layer MRI was superior in determining VF. Single-layer MRI may be a better tool to recognize changes of VF after bariatric procedures.",10.1007/s11695-014-1382-z,,,,1384
153,Mesenteric Defect Closure and the Rate of Internal Hernia in Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Internal hernias are a worrying complication from laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRGB), with potential small bowel necrosis and obstruction. An electronic database search of Medline, Embase, and Pubmed was performed. All studies investigating the internal hernia rates in patients whose mesenteric defects were closed vs. not closed during LRGB were analysed. Odds ratios were calculated to assess the difference in internal hernia rate. A total of 14 studies totalling 20,553 patients undergoing LRGB were included. Internal hernia rate (220/12,445 (2%) closure vs. 509/8108 (6%) non-closure) and re-operation for small bowel obstruction (86/5437 (2%) closed vs. 300/3132 (10%) non-closure) were reduced when defects were closed. There was no difference observed when sutures were used to close the defects compared to clips/staples.",10.1007/s11695-023-06597-0,,,,1385
106,"Dumping syndrome after bariatric surgery: prevalence, pathophysiology and role in weight reduction - a systematic review.","Dumping syndrome is a frequent and wellknown adverse event after bariatric surgery and covers a dynamic spectrum of early and late dumping. Accelerated gastric emptying is generally considered to be the cause of gastrointestinal and vasomotor complaints. However, there is much uncertainty regarding the exact pathophysiology of dumping. It has been speculated that the syndrome is a desired consequence of bariatric surgery and contributes to more efficient weight loss, but supporting data are scarce. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed in July-August 2021. The prevalence of dumping after the most frequently performed bariatric procedures was analyzed, as well as underlying pathophysiology and its role in weight reduction. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is associated with the highest postoperative prevalence of dumping. The fast transit induces neurohumoral changes which contribute to an imbalance between postprandial glucose and insulin levels, resulting in hypoglycemia which is the hallmark of late dumping. Early dumping can, when received in a positive way, become a tool to maintain a strict dietary pattern, but no significant relationship to the degree of weight loss has been shown. However, late dumping is detrimental and promotes overall higher caloric intake. Dumping syndrome is common after bariatric surgery, especially after RYGB. The pathophysiology is complex and ambiguous. Currently available data do not support dumping as a necessary condition to induce weight loss after bariatric surgery.",10.51821/86.3.11476,,,,1386
966,Simple Reshaping of the Breast in Massive Weight Loss Patients: Promising Preliminary Results.,"The challenging breast reshaping after massive weight loss (MWL) has been increasingly performed as the number of bariatric surgery procedures increase worldwide. The breasts often appear wide, lateralized, and deflated, with significant ptosis. The aim of this article is to share our initial experience using the lower pole subglandular advancement mastoplasty (LOPOSAM) technique to reshape the breasts in MWL patients and to elaborate the technical details and simplicity of the method in the attached video. We performed 30 LOPOSAM procedures in 15 MWL women aged 24 to 63 years from February to September 2015. We used a wise pattern mark-up and a superior based pedicle for the relocation of the nipple areola complex. The key step for the autoaugmentation was an inferior and central mound based parabola-shaped flap, which was placed in a subglandular pocket to reshape the breast and lift the inframammary crease. The median operation time for the LOPOSAM procedure was 81 minutes (range, 35-160 minutes) by 2 surgeons. The median weight loss was 64 kg (range, 45-103) and 22 body mass index units (range, 16-33) per patient. The median follow-up was 240 days (range, 105 Powered by Editorial Manager and ProduXion Manager from Aries Systems Corporation to 345). The surgical goal was achieved in all cases. Four complications occurred in 3 patients, 1 major, a hematoma-requiring surgery and 3 minor wound dehiscence. The self-reported patient satisfaction was high, 13 were very satisfied with the result, 1 satisfied, and 1 less satisfied. The LOPOSAM technique is quick and simple to perform, and the preliminary results are promising. However, a longer follow-up is needed to confirm this.",10.1097/SAP.0000000000000816,,,,1387
770,Systematic review of operative outcomes of robotic surgical procedures performed with endoscopic linear staplers or robotic staplers.,"A comprehensive review of operative outcomes of robotic surgical procedures performed with the da Vinci robotic system using either endoscopic linear staplers (ELS) or robotic staplers is not available in the published literature. We conducted a literature search to identify publications of robotic surgical procedures in all specialties performed with either ELS or robotic staplers. Twenty-nine manuscripts and six abstracts with relevant information on operative outcomes published from January 2011 to September 2017 were identified. Given the relatively recent market release of robotic staplers in 2014, comparative perioperative clinical outcomes data on the performance of ELS vs. robotic staplers in robotic surgery is very sparse in the published literature. Only three comparative studies of surgeries with the da Vinci robotic system plus ELS vs. da Vinci plus robotic staplers were identified; two in robotic colorectal surgery and the other in robotic gastric bypass surgery. These comparative studies illustrate some nuances in device design and usability, which may impact outcomes and cost, and therefore may be important to consider when selecting the appropriate stapling technologies/technique for different robotic surgeries. Comparative perioperative data on the use of ELS vs. robotic staplers in robotic surgery is scarce (three studies), and current literature identifies both types of devices as safe and effective. Given the longer clinical history of ELS and its relatively more robust evidence base, there may be trade-offs to consider before switching to robotic staplers in certain robotic procedures. However, this literature review may serve as an initial reference for future research.",10.1007/s11701-018-0822-5,,,,1388
707,Systematic review of olfactory shifts related to obesity.,"The modern food environment is a key driver of rising levels of obesity. While olfaction is known to play a major role in food choice; however, its relationship to obesity is yet to be understood. This review assesses current knowledge of the interaction between obesity and olfaction. This review is based on observational studies comparing olfactory abilities across weight groups (NÂ =Â 10) and clinical studies evaluating olfactory changes following bariatric surgery (NÂ =Â 9). Meta-analyses were performed on data collected by a standard olfactory assessment tool (SniffinÎ„ Sticks), to test whether olfaction has any association with body weight or bariatric surgery. This review synthesizes findings derived from 38 datasets, with a total of 1432 individual olfactory assessments. The meta-analyses suggest that olfactory function is negatively correlated with body weight. In addition, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients frequently report olfactory changes, yet more pronounced and immediate shifts have been observed among sleeve gastrectomy recipients. Our review finds strong evidence for the link between olfaction and obesity and indicates that bariatric surgery (particularly the sleeve gastrectomy) is effective in reversing olfactory decline associated with obesity. In conclusion, we present mechanistic models to underpin the observed relationship between olfaction and obesity.",10.1111/obr.12800,,,,1389
622,Exercise Mitigates Bone Loss in Women With Severe Obesity After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Bone loss after bariatric surgery potentially could be mitigated by exercise. To investigate the role of exercise training (ET) in attenuating bariatric surgery-induced bone loss. Randomized, controlled trial. Referral center for bariatric surgery. Seventy women with severe obesity, aged 25 to 55 years, who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Supervised, 6-month, ET program after RYGB vs. standard of care (RYGB only). Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) was the primary outcome. Bone microarchitecture, bone turnover, and biochemical markers were secondary outcomes. Surgery significantly decreased femoral neck, total hip, distal radius, and whole body aBMD (P < 0.001); and increased bone turnover markers, including collagen type I C-telopeptide (CTX), procollagen type I N-propeptide (P1NP), sclerostin, and osteopontin (P < 0.05). Compared with RYGB only, exercise mitigated the percent loss of aBMD at femoral neck [estimated mean difference (EMD), -2.91%; P = 0.007;], total hip (EMD, -2.26%; P = 0.009), distal radius (EMD, -1.87%; P = 0.038), and cortical volumetric bone mineral density at distal radius (EMD, -2.09%; P = 0.024). Exercise also attenuated CTX (EMD, -0.20 ng/mL; P = 0.002), P1NP (EMD, -17.59 ng/mL; P = 0.024), and sclerostin levels (EMD, -610 pg/mL; P = 0.046) in comparison with RYGB. Exercise did not affect biochemical markers (e.g., 25(OH)D, calcium, intact PTH, phosphorus, and magnesium). Exercise mitigated bariatric surgery-induced bone loss, possibly through mechanisms involving suppression in bone turnover and sclerostin. Exercise should be incorporated in postsurgery care to preserve bone mass.",10.1210/jc.2019-00074,,,,1390
1338,Effects of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase activity in obese type 2 diabetics.,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway that provides the majority of NADPH required for lipid biosynthesis. G6PD overexpression has been implicated in insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and increased oxidative stress in animals. This study examines G6PD expression in obese diabetic and nondiabetic subjects pre- and post-laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). Patients undergoing LRYGB were recruited for the IRB-approved study and placed in either the diabetic (n = 11) or nondiabetic group (n = 16) (diabetic, HbA1c > 6.5%; nondiabetic, HbA1c < 6.0%). Blood samples were collected at baseline and throughout the first 3 postoperative months. Liver, adipose, and omental samples were taken during surgery. Results are expressed as mean Â± SEM and were compared statistically using the Mann-Whitney test. The two groups were not significantly different at baseline except for fasting glucose and HbA1c. G6PD activity (nm/min/mg protein) was significantly higher in red blood cells (RBCs) (3.12 Â± 1.39 vs. 0.67 Â± 0.14) and liver (17.23 Â± 2.40 vs. 9.74 Â± 2.18) in diabetics compared to nondiabetics. There was good correlation between increased liver G6PD activity and the severity of diabetes as measured by HbA1c (r (2) = 0.525) and fasting glucose (r (2) = 0.542). No significant difference was found in the adipose or omental G6PD expression. Both groups experienced a significant increase in G6PD blood activity shortly following surgery (1 week) followed by a reduction 3 months after surgery. These results are the first ever seen in human subjects and demonstrate increased G6PD activity in diabetics compared to nondiabetics. These results suggest a correlation between G6PD activity and the severity of type 2 diabetes. The early increases in G6PD activity after LRYGB were unexpected and longer follow-up is needed to determine the effects of LRYGB on G6PD activity.",10.1007/s00464-011-1959-8,,,,1391
380,The impact of tube replacement timing during LCIG therapy on PEG-J associated adverse events: a retrospective multicenter observational study.,"Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) treatment, a unique drug delivery system for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), is covered by health insurance in Japan since September 2016. Various LCIG procedure/device-associated adverse events (AEs) have been reported; however, reports on their treatment have been limited. This is the first multicenter study to clarify the frequency and timing of device-related AEs. Between September 2016 and December 2018, 104 patients introduced to the LCIG treatment for advanced PD in 11 hospitals were included. The patients' characteristics, AEs incidence, AEs time, and tube exchange time were investigated. The median follow-up period was 21.5Â months. Minor AE cases were 29.4%, whereas major AE cases were 43.1%. Majority of major AEs (nâ€‰=â€‰55, 94.8%) were managed with endoscopic treatment, such as tube exchange. Few severe AEs required surgical treatment (nâ€‰=3, 5.2%). The mean (range) exposure to percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy (PEG-J) was 14.7 (0-33) months. One year after the LCIG treatment introduction, 55 patients (54.0%) retained the original PEG-J tube. The mean PEG-J tube exchange time was 10.8â€‰Â±â€‰7.0Â months in all patients, 11.6â€‰Â±â€‰4.7 and 10.5â€‰Â±â€‰7.7Â months in patients with scheduled exchange and who underwent exchange due to AEs, respectively. Some device-related AEs occurred during the LCIG treatment; however, only few were serious, most of which could be treated with simple procedures or tube replacement with endoscopy. Therefore, the LCIG treatment is feasible and safe and is a unique treatment option for PD, requiring endoscopists' understanding and cooperation.",10.1186/s12883-021-02269-7,,,,1392
1187,Continuous positive airway pressure/pressure support pre-oxygenation of morbidly obese patients.,"Morbidly obese patients are more prone to desaturation of arterial blood during apnea with induction of anesthesia than are non-obese. This study aimed to assess the effect of low-pressure continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with pressure support ventilation (PSV) during pre-oxygenation on partial oxygen pressure in arterial blood (PaO2 ) immediately after tracheal intubation (post-intubation PaO2). Forty-four adult patients scheduled for laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery were pre-oxygenated with 80% O2 for 2 min, randomized either to CPAP 5 cm H2O + PSV 5 cm H2O (CPAP/PSV, n = 22) or neutral-pressure breathing without CPAP/PSV (control, n = 22). Anesthesia was induced in a rapid-sequence protocol and the trachea was intubated without prior mask ventilation. Arterial blood gases were measured before pre-oxygenation, before induction of anesthesia, and immediately following intubation, before the first positive pressure breath. After pre-oxygenation, partial carbondioxide pressure was significantly lower in the CPAP/PSV group (4.9 Â± 0.5 kPa), (mean Â± standard deviation) than in the control group (5.2 Â± 0.7 kPa) (P = 0.025). Post-preoxygenation PaO2 did not differ between the groups, but post-intubation PaO2 was significantly higher in the CPAP/PSV group (32.2 Â± 4.1 kPa) than in the control group (23.8 Â± 8.8 kPa) (P < 0.001). In the control group, nadir oxygen saturation was lower (median 98%, range 83-99%) than in the CPAP/PSV group (median 99%, range 97-99%, P = 0.011). In morbidly obese patients, low-pressure CPAP combined with low-pressure PSV during pre-oxygenation resulted in better oxygenation, compared with neutral-pressure breathing, and prevented desaturation episodes.",10.1111/aas.12317,,,,1393
1563,Lipid peroxidation in bariatric candidates with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) -- preliminary findings.,"Pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains incompletely known, and oxidative stress is one of the mechanisms incriminated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of liver oxidative stress in NAFLD affecting morbidly obese patients. 39 consecutive patients with BMI >40 kg/m2 submitted to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were enrolled, and wedge liver biopsy was obtained during operation. Oxidative stress was measured by concentration of hydroperoxides (CEOOH) in liver tissue. Female gender was dominant (89.7%) and median age was 43.6 +/- 11.1 years. Histology showed fatty liver in 92.3%, including 43.6% with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), 48.7% with isolated steatosis and just 7.7% with normal liver. Liver cirrhosis was present in 11.7% of those with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Concentration of CEOOH was increased in the liver of patients with NASH when compared to isolated steatosis and normal liver (0.26+/- 0.17, 0.20+/- 0.01 and 0.14+/- 0.00 nmol/mg protein, respectively) (P < 0.01). Liver biochemical variables were normal in 92.3% of all cases, and no difference between NASH and isolated steatosis could be demonstrated. 1) Nonalcoholic steatosis, steatohepatitis and cirrhosis were identified in substantial numbers of morbidly obese patients; 2) Concentration of hydroperoxides was increased in steatohepatitis, consistent with a pathogenetic role for oxidative stress in this condition.",10.1381/0960892053723493,,,,1394
933,Difficult Tracheal Intubation in Obese Gastric Bypass patients.,"Endotracheal intubation is commonly perceived to be more difficult in obese patients than in lean patients. Primarily, we investigated the association between difficult tracheal intubation (DTI) and obesity, and secondarily, the association between DTI and validated scoring systems used to assess the airways, the association between DTI and quantities of anesthetics used to induce general anesthesia, and the association between DTI and difficulties with venous and arterial cannulation. This is a monocentric prospective observational clinical study of a consecutive series of 539 obese patients undergoing gastric bypass. Tracheal intubation was done preoperatively together with scoring of Intubation Score (IS), Mallampati (MLP), and Cormack-Lehane classification (CLC) and registration of the quantities of anesthetics and total attempts on cannulation. The overall proportion of patients with DTI was 3.5Â % and the patients with DTI were more frequently males, had higher CLC, higher American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification (ASA), and noticeably, a lower BMI compared to the patients with easy tracheal intubation. After adjustment with multivariable analyses body mass index (BMI) <40, CLC >2, ASA scores >2, and male gender were risk factors of DTI. Males generally had higher CLC, MLP, and ASA scores compared to females, but no difference in BMI. There was no difference in quantities of anesthetics used between the two groups with or without DTI. Intra-venous and intra-arterial cannulation was succeeded in first attempt in 85 and 86Â % of the patients, respectively, and there were no association between BMI and difficult vascular access. We found no association between increasing BMI and DTI.",10.1007/s11695-016-2141-0,,,,1395
709,Effect of Bariatric Surgery on Semen Parameters: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND The present systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to explore the possible effect of bariatric surgery on semen parameters. MATERIAL AND METHODS Studies on the effect of bariatric surgeries on semen parameters were collected by searching Cochrane Library, PUBMED, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and CNKI databases. We extracted information on essential data and outcome measures, including study design, bariatric surgery, and semen parameters at baseline and after the surgery from the included studies, and STATA 12.0 software was applied to conduct the meta-analysis. Predefined subgroup analyses were also conducted by study design and bariatric surgical procedures. The standard mean difference (SMD) was calculated to estimate the effect on semen parameters. RESULTS After the literature search, 6 articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included in the present meta-analysis. The results revealed that patients who had undergone gastric bypass surgery had an increase in semen volume (SMD (95%CI)=0.583 (0.121-1.045), p=0.013). However, the seminal concentration (overall, SMD (95%CI)=-0.123 (-0.418-0.173), p=0.416) and the semen progressive motility (overall SMD (95%CI)=0.148 (-0.148-0.444), p=0.328) remained unchanged after the bariatric surgery. Nevertheless, semen normal morphology experienced an increase in the subgroup of prospective design and sleeve gastrectomy (prospective study, SMD (95%CI)= 0.385 (0.074-0.697), p=0.015, sleeve gastrectomy, SMD (95%CI)=0.880 (0.465-1.296), p=0.000; overall, SMD (95%CI)=0.372 (0.068-0.677), p=0.017). CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, based on the limitations of the present meta-analysis, definite conclusions cannot be reached regarding the possible effect of bariatric surgery on semen parameters.",10.12659/MSMBR.910862,,,,1396
1521,Influence of liver biopsy heterogeneity and diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in subjects undergoing gastric bypass.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic condition that can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer. The most progressive form of NAFLD is nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Currently, the only method to diagnose NASH is with a liver biopsy; however. sampling error may limit diagnostic accuracy. We investigated the discordance of paired liver biopsies in individuals undergoing gastric bypass. Two liver biopsies, composite size of > or = 25 mm and > or = 8 portal tracts (PTs), were obtained from the left lobe in 31 subjects. Group 1 included specimens at least 15 mm in length with > or = 4 PTs compared to a second biopsy of at least 10 mm and > or = 4 PTs (Group 2). The mean specimen size (number of PTs) for group 1 was 20.4 +/- 4.2 mm (11.7 +/- 5.5 PTs) and group 2 was 16.1 +/- 5.3 mm (8.2 +/- 4.1 PTs). Prevalence of NASH was 26% in Group 1 and 32% in Group 2. Sampling discordance was greatest for portal fibrosis (26%), followed by zone 3 fibrosis (13%) and ballooning degeneration (3%). The negative predictive values from Group 1 liver biopsies for NASH and portal fibrosis were only 83% and 67%, respectively. The results demonstrate that significant sampling variability exists in class 2 and 3 obese individuals undergoing screening liver biopsies for NAFLD. The degree and histopathological discordance is dependent upon zonal location and types of injury. Nevertheless, a 25-mm biopsy specimen without zone 3 cellular ballooning or fibrosis appears adequate to exclude the diagnosis of NASH.",10.1007/s11695-007-9041-2,,,,1397
1049,Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Vertical Banded Gastroplasty Induce Long-Term Changes on the Human Gut Microbiome Contributing to Fat Mass Regulation.,"Bariatric surgery is currently the most effective procedure for the treatment of obesity. Given the role of the gut microbiota in regulating host metabolism and adiposity, we investigated the long-term effects of bariatric surgery on the microbiome of patients randomized to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or vertical banded gastroplasty and matched for weight and fat mass loss. The two surgical procedures induced similar and durable changes on the gut microbiome that were not dependent on body mass index and resulted in altered levels of fecal and circulating metabolites compared with obese controls. By colonizing germ-free mice with stools from the patients, we demonstrated that the surgically altered microbiota promoted reduced fat deposition in recipient mice. These mice also had a lower respiratory quotient, indicating decreased utilization of carbohydrates as fuel. Our results suggest that the gut microbiota may play a direct role in the reduction of adiposity observed after bariatric surgery.",10.1016/j.cmet.2015.07.009,,,,1398
884,Gastric bypass surgery with exercise alters plasma microRNAs that predict improvements in cardiometabolic risk.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery improves insulin sensitivity (SI) and Î²-cell function in obese non-diabetic subjects. Exercise also improves SI and may be an effective adjunct therapy to RYGB surgery. However, the mechanisms by which exercise or weight loss improve peripheral SI after RYGB surgery are unclear. We hypothesized that microRNAs (miRNAs) mediate at least some of the regulatory processes driving such mechanisms. Consequently, this work aimed at profiling plasma miRNAs in participants of the Physical Activity Following Surgery Induced Weight Loss study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00692367), to assess whether miRNA levels track with improvements in SI and cardiometabolic risk factors. Ninety-four miRNAs implicated in metabolism were profiled in plasma samples from 22 severely obese subjects who were recruited 1-3 months after RYGB surgery and followed for 6 months of RYGB surgery-induced weight loss, with (exercise program (EX), N=11) or without (CON, N=11) an exercise training intervention. The subjects were selected, considering a priori sample size calculations, among the participants in the parent study. Mixed-effect modeling for repeated measures and partial correlation analysis was implemented in the R environment for statistical analysis. Mirroring results in the parent trial, both groups experienced significant weight loss and improvements in cardiometabolic risk. In the CON group, weight loss significantly altered the pattern of circulating miR-7, miR-15a, miR-34a, miR-106a, miR-122 and miR-221. In the EX group, a distinct miRNA signature was altered: miR-15a, miR-34a, miR-122, miR-135b, miR-144, miR-149 and miR-206. Several miRNAs were significantly associated with improvements in acute insulin response, SI, and other cardiometabolic risk factors. These findings present novel insights into the RYGB surgery-induced molecular changes and the effects of mild exercise to facilitate and/or maintain the benefits of a 'comprehensive' weight-loss intervention with concomitant improvements in cardiometabolic functions. Notably, we show a predictive value for miR-7, miR-15a, miR-106b and miR-135b.",10.1038/ijo.2017.84,,,,1399
51,Does routine upper gastrointestinal swallow study after metabolic and bariatric surgery lead to earlier diagnosis of leak?,"It is unclear whether routine upper gastrointestinal swallow study (SS) in the immediate postoperative period is associated with earlier diagnosis of gastrointestinal leak after bariatric surgery. To investigate the relationship between routine SS and time to diagnosis of postoperative gastrointestinal leak. MBSAQIP-accredited hospitals in the United States and Canada. We conducted an observational cohort study of adults who underwent laparoscopic primary Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) (n = 82,510) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) (n = 283,520) using the MBSAQIP 2015-2019 database. Propensity scores were used to match patient cohorts who underwent routine versus no routine SS. Primary outcome was time to diagnosis of leak. Median days to diagnosis of leak were compared. The Nelson-Aalen estimator was used to determine the cumulative hazards of leak. In our study, 36,280 (23%) RYGB and 135,335 (33%) SG patients received routine SS. Routine SS was not associated with earlier diagnosis of leak (RYGB routine SS median 7 [IQR 3-12] days v. no routine SS 6 [2-11] days, P = .9; SG routine SS 15 [9-22] days v. no routine SS 14 [8-21] days, P = .06) or lower risk of developing leak (RYGB HR 1.0, 95%-CI .8-1.2; SG HR 1.1, 95%-CI 1.0-1.4). More routine SS patients had a length of stay 2 days or greater (RYGB 78.3% v. 61.1%; SG 48.6% v. 40.3%). Routine SS was not associated with earlier diagnosis of leaks compared to the absence of routine SS. Surgeons should consider abandoning the practice of routine SS for the purpose of obtaining earlier diagnosis of postoperative leaks.",10.1016/j.soard.2024.02.005,,,,1400
394,Impact of gastric resection and enteric anastomotic configuration on delayed gastric emptying after pancreaticoduodenectomy: a network meta-analysis of randomized trials.,"Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) is frequent after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). Several RCTs have explored operative strategies to minimize DGE, however, the optimal combination of gastric resection approach, anastomotic route, configuration and the use of enteroenterostomy remains unclear. MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL databases were systematically searched for RCTs comparing gastric resection (classic Whipple, pylorus-resecting, pylorus-preserving), anastomotic route (antecolic, retrocolic), configuration (loop gastroenterostomy/Billroth II, Roux-en-Y), and use of enteroenterostomy (Braun). A random-effects, Bayesian network meta-analysis with non-informative priors was conducted to determine the optimal combination of approaches to PD for minimizing DGE. Twenty-four RCTs, including 2526 patients and 14 approaches were included. There was some heterogeneity, although inconsistency was low. The overall incidence of DGE was 25.6 per cent (647 patients). Pylorus-resecting, antecolic, Billroth II with Braun enteroenterostomy was associated with the lowest rates of DGE and ranked the best in 35 per cent of comparisons. Classic Whipple, retrocolic, Billroth II with Braun ranked the worst for DGE in 32 per cent of comparisons. Pairwise meta-analysis of retrocolic versus antecolic route for gastrojejunostomy found increased risk of DGE with the retrocolic route (odds ratio 2.10, 95 per cent credibility interval (cr.i.) 0.92 to 4.70). Pairwise meta-analysis of enteroenterostomy found a trend towards lower DGE rates when this was used (odds ratio 1.90, 95 per cent cr.i. 0.92 to 3.90). Having a Braun enteroenterostomy ranked the best in 96 per cent of comparisons. Based on existing RCT evidence, a pylorus-resecting, antecolic, Billroth II with Braun enteroenterostomy seems to be associated with the lowest rates of DGE. PROSPERO submitted 23 December 2020.

687,Adequate Multivitamin Supplementation after Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass Results in a Decrease of National Health Care Costs: a Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.,"Patients with morbid obesity undergoing metabolic surgery are prone to develop vitamin and mineral deficiencies, which may worsen in time. In order to prevent these deficiencies after metabolic surgery, all patients are advised to take daily multivitamin supplementation. The aim of the study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of specially developed multivitamins (WLS ForteÂ®) for metabolic surgery and over-the-counter (standard) multivitamin supplementation (sMVS). This cost-effectiveness analysis was preformed alongside an RCT for the Netherlands. Between June 2011 and March 2012, a total of 148 patients were randomized to one tablet daily of either WLS ForteÂ® or sMVS. The patients were followed for 12Â months. Data on costs within the health sector and outside the health sector were collected. The primary outcome is financial and logistic advantages, in terms of less patient visits to the outpatient department and the relevant costs to the employer due to absenteeism. In total, 10 (14%) patients in the WLS ForteÂ® group versus 23 (30%) patients in the sMVS group developed a deficiency. The costs for the WLS forteÂ® supplement were â‚¬38 versus â‚¬23 for sMVS. Additional return visits and associated costs for medical staff were the largest costs, up to 43% in the sMVS group. Total costs for supplementation with sMVS were â‚¬243 versus â‚¬134 for WLS ForteÂ®. Preventing deficiencies with WLS ForteÂ® seem initially more expensive than sMVS. However, treatment with WLS ForteÂ® resulted in less vitamin and mineral deficiencies, which eventually resulted in less overall costs.",10.1007/s11695-019-03750-6,,,,1402
695,"Mechanisms of action of a carbohydrate-reduced, high-protein diet in reducing the risk of postprandial hypoglycemia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.","Postprandial hypoglycemia is a risk after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). We speculated that a carbohydrate-reduced, high-protein (CRHP) diet might reduce the risk of hypoglycemia and therefore compared the acute effects of a conventionally recommended (CR) diet and CRHP diet [55/30 energy percent (E%) carbohydrate and 15/30 E% protein, respectively] in RYGB patients. Ten individuals (2 males, 8 females, meanÂ Â±Â SD age 47Â Â±Â 7 y; stable body mass index 31Â Â±Â 6 kg/m2; 6Â Â±Â 3 y post-RYGB) with recurrent postprandial hypoglycemia documented by plasma glucose (PG) â‰¤3.4 mmol/L were examined on 2 d with isoenergetic CRHP or CR diets comprising a breakfast and subsequent lunch meal. Peak PG was significantly reduced on the CRHP diet after breakfast and lunch by 11% and 31% compared with the CR diet. Nadir PG increased significantly on CRHP (by 13% and 9%). Insulin secretion was reduced, and glucagon secretion increased on the CRHP diet after both meals. Glucagon-like peptide 1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide secretion were lower after lunch but unaltered after breakfast on CRHP; Î²-cell function and insulin clearance were unchanged. The CRHP diet lowered glucose excursions and reduced insulin secretion and incretin hormone responses, but enhanced glucagon responses compared with the CR diet. Taken together, the results may explain the decreased glucose variability and lower risk of postprandial hypoglycemia.

1436,Surgical gastrojejunostomy or endoscopic stent placement for the palliation of malignant gastric outlet obstruction (SUSTENT study): a multicenter randomized trial.,"Both gastrojejunostomy (GJJ) and stent placement are commonly used palliative treatments of obstructive symptoms caused by malignant gastric outlet obstruction (GOO). Compare GJJ and stent placement. Multicenter, randomized trial. Twenty-one centers in The Netherlands. Patients with GOO. GJJ and stent placement. Outcomes were medical effects, quality of life, and costs. Analysis was by intent to treat. Eighteen patients were randomized to GJJ and 21 to stent placement. Food intake improved more rapidly after stent placement than after GJJ (GOO Scoring System score > or = 2: median 5 vs 8 days, respectively; P < .01) but long-term relief was better after GJJ, with more patients living more days with a GOO Scoring System score of 2 or more than after stent placement (72 vs 50 days, respectively; P = .05). More major complications (stent: 6 in 4 patients vs GJJ: 0; P = .02), recurrent obstructive symptoms (stent: 8 in 5 patients vs GJJ: 1 in 1 patient; P = .02), and reinterventions (stent: 10 in 7 patients vs GJJ: 2 in 2 patients; P < .01) were observed after stent placement compared with GJJ. When stent obstruction was not regarded as a major complication, no differences in complications were found (P = .4). There were also no differences in median survival (stent: 56 days vs GJJ: 78 days) and quality of life. Mean total costs of GJJ were higher compared with stent placement ($16,535 vs $11,720, respectively; P = .049 [comparing medians]). Because of the small study population, only initial hospital costs would have been statistically significant if the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing had been applied. Relatively small patient population. Despite slow initial symptom improvement, GJJ was associated with better long-term results and is therefore the treatment of choice in patients with a life expectancy of 2 months or longer. Because stent placement was associated with better short-term outcomes, this treatment is preferable for patients expected to live less than 2 months.

1363,Variations in circulating inflammatory factors are related to changes in calorie and carbohydrate intakes early in the course of surgery-induced weight reduction.,"Obesity is considered a low-grade inflammatory state that improves with weight loss. In addition to acute-phase proteins, other cytokines might contribute to systemic inflammation. Our objective was to compare serum concentrations of a large panel of inflammation-related factors in obese and normal-weight subjects and to determine kinetic changes induced by caloric restriction. The cohort comprised 14 normal-weight women and 51 obese women who were followed over 2 y after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Multiplexed proteomics were used to simultaneously assay 27 cytokines and growth factors in serum. Concentrations of interleukin (IL)-9, IL-1-receptor antagonist, IL-10, interferon-Î³-inducible protein 10, macrophage inflammatory protein 1Î², monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, IL-8, RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), monokine induced by interferon-Î³, and vascular endothelial growth factor were found to be elevated in obesity. IL-10 was further elevated in diabetic obese patients, whereas eotaxin was found to be higher only in diabetic subjects. After surgery, many factors showed a biphasic pattern of variation, decreasing sharply at month 3 before rising back to presurgical values at month 6; these changes closely tracked similar kinetic changes in calorie and carbohydrate intake. After 1 y, an overall reduction in cytokines accompanied the reduction in body mass index and an amelioration in metabolic status. Obesity is associated with elevated circulating concentrations of a large panel of cytokines. Coordinated kinetic changes during weight loss suggest an early influence of calorie and carbohydrate intakes, whereas a longer-term reduction in corpulence might prevail in regulating circulating cytokine concentrations.

329,High-throughput mediation analysis of human proteome and metabolome identifies mediators of post-bariatric surgical diabetes control.,"To improve the power of mediation in high-throughput studies, here we introduce High-throughput mediation analysis (Hitman), which accounts for direction of mediation and applies empirical Bayesian linear modeling. We apply Hitman in a retrospective, exploratory analysis of the SLIMM-T2D clinical trial in which participants with type 2 diabetes were randomized to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or nonsurgical diabetes/weight management, and fasting plasma proteome and metabolome were assayed up to 3 years. RYGB caused greater improvement in HbA1c, which was mediated by growth hormone receptor (GHR). GHR's mediation is more significant than clinical mediators, including BMI. GHR decreases at 3 months postoperatively alongside increased insulin-like growth factor binding proteins IGFBP1/BP2; plasma GH increased at 1 year. Experimental validation indicates (1) hepatic GHR expression decreases in post-bariatric rats; (2) GHR knockdown in primary hepatocytes decreases gluconeogenic gene expression and glucose production. Thus, RYGB may induce resistance to diabetogenic effects of GH signaling.Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01073020.",10.1038/s41467-021-27289-2,,,,1408

This systematic review aimed to identify and critique the evidence for vitamin A, B1, C or E deficiencies associated with bariatric surgery. This review utilised PRISMA and MOOSE frameworks with NHMRC evidence hierarchy and the American Dietetic Association bias tool to assess the quality of articles. Twenty-one articles were included and once critiqued all studies were of level IV grade and neutral or negative in quality.

1311,Effects of aerobic exercise training on variability and heart rate kinetic during submaximal exercise after gastric bypass surgery--a randomized controlled trial.,"This study aimed to determine whether morbidly obese women have an alteration of heart rate (HR) kinetics and HR variability (HRV) during the 6-min walk test (6MWT) and if an aerobic exercise training can modify these indexes after gastric bypass surgery (GBS). Nineteen morbidly obese women were randomized to a trained (TG) or control group and 12 women of eutrophic group (EG) were also evaluated. The obese women were tested on two occasions: 1 week before and 4 months after GBS through record of HR and R-R intervals during 6MWT for analysis HR kinetics. The TG underwent an aerobic exercise training program on a treadmill (1-h session, totaling 36 sessions over 12-week). Both obese groups demonstrated a significant reduction of rMSSD and slower HR kinetics during the 6MWT when compared to the EG. In addition, only the TG demonstrated a significant improvement in HRV indexes, walking distance, faster time constant and mean response time of HR during 6MWT after training (p < 0.05). Morbidly obese women have slower HR kinetics and altered cardiac modulation during submaximal exercise. However, aerobic exercise training can produce beneficial adaptations in HRV and faster HR kinetics following GBS.",10.3109/09638288.2012.694575,,,,1410
869,Heterogeneity of proliferative markers in pancreatic Î²-cells of patients with severe hypoglycemia following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Severe postprandial hypoglycemia with neuroglycopenia is an increasingly recognized, debilitating complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. Increased secretion of insulin and incretin hormones is implicated in its pathogenesis. Histopathologic examination of pancreas has demonstrated increased islet size and/or nuclear diameter in post-RYGB patients who underwent pancreatectomy for severe refractory hypoglycemia with neuroglycopenia (RYGBÂ +Â NG). We aimed to determine whether Î²-cell proliferation or apoptosis is altered in RYGBÂ +Â NG. We performed an observational study to analyze markers of proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and transcription factor expression in pancreatic tissue from affected RYGBÂ +Â NG patients (nÂ =Â 12), normoglycemic patients undergoing pancreatic surgery for benign lesions (controls, nÂ =Â 6), and individuals with hypoglycemia due to insulinoma (nÂ =Â 52). Proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression was increased in insulin-positive cells in RYGBÂ +Â NG patients (4.5-fold increase, pÂ <Â 0.001 vs. controls) and correlated with Î²-cell mass. Ki-67 immunoreactivity was low in both RYGBÂ +Â NG and controls, but did not differ between groups. Phospho-histone H3 levels did not differ between RYGBÂ +Â NG and controls. PCNA and Ki-67 were both significantly lower in both controls and RYGBÂ +Â NG than insulinomas. Markers of apoptosis and cell cycle (M30, p27, and p21) did not differ between groups. PDX1 and menin exhibited similar expression patterns, while FOXO1 appeared to be more cytosolic in RYGBÂ +Â NG. Markers of proliferation are heterogeneous in patients with severe post-RYGB hypoglycemia. Increased Î²-cell proliferation in some individuals may contribute to increased Î²-cell mass observed in severely affected patients.",10.1007/s00592-017-1001-2,,,,1411
417,Changes in Circulating Cytokines and Adipokines After RYGB in Patients with and without Type 2 Diabetes.,"This study aimed to compare cytokine and adipokine levels in patients with obesity with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) at baseline and 6 months after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) with healthy controls. A total of 34 patients (21 with T2D) with BMI of 30 to 45 kg/m2 were compared with 25 healthy controls without obesity. Cytokines, adipokines, and peptides of relevance for inflammation and metabolism were analyzed in plasma. Significant decreases in weight and glycated hemoglobin A1c were observed. At baseline, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IFN-Î², IL-18, leptin, and hepatocyte growth factor were higher in all patients with obesity compared with healthy controls. In patients without T2D, TNF-Î±, IL-1Î±, IL-2, IL-15, and visfatin were also increased, whereas bone morphogenic protein-4 was decreased. Following RYGB, IL-6 and hepatocyte growth factor were still increased in both groups compared with controls. In T2D patients, IFN-Î², IL-27, IL-1Î±, IL-2, regenerating islet-derived protein 3A, visfatin, and osteopontin were found to be increased. In patients without T2D, TNF-Î±, IL-1Î±, IL-2, IL-15, leptin, and visfatin remained increased. The altered cytokine profile of patients with obesity persisted after RYGB despite large weight loss and improved metabolic status, thus reflecting an inherent inflammatory state.",10.1002/oby.23093,,,,1412
931,"Incretin effects, gastric emptying and insulin responses to low oral glucose loads in patients after gastric bypass and lean and obese controls.","After laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), many patients suffer from dumping syndrome. Oral glucose tolerance tests are usually carried out with 50-75 g of glucose. The aim of this study was to examine whether minimal glucose loads of 10 g and 25 g induce a reliable secretion of satiation peptides without dumping symptoms after LRYGB. In addition, lean and obese controls were examined. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of low oral glucose loads on incretin release and gastric emptying. All surgical procedures were performed by the same surgeon (RP) at the St. Claraspital Basel in Switzerland. Oral glucose challenges were carried out at the University Hospital of Basel (Phase 1 Research Unit). Eight patients 10Â±.4 weeks after LRYGB (PostOP; body mass index [BMI]: 38.6 kg/m2Â±1.7) as well as 12 lean controls (LC; BMI: 21.8 kg/m2Â±.6) and 12 obese controls (OC; BMI 38.7 kg/m2Â±1.3) received 10 g and 25 g of oral glucose. We examined clinical signs of dumping syndrome; plasma glucose, insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, and peptide tyrosine tyrosine concentrations; and gastric emptying with a 13 C-sodium acetate breath test. No signs of dumping were seen in PostOP. Compared with OC, LC showed lower fasting glucose, insulin, and C-peptide, and lower homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and AUC-180 for insulin and C-peptide. In PostOP, fasting insulin, HOMA and AUC-180 for insulin was lower and no difference was found in fasting C-peptide or AUC-180 for C-peptide compared to OC. There was no significant difference in fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide, HOMA and AUC-180 for insulin in PostOP compared to LC, but AUC-180 for C-peptide was higher in PostOP. AUC-60 for gut hormones was similar in OC and LC and higher in PostOP compared to OC or LC. gastric emptying was slower in LC and OC compared with PostOP. After LRYGB, 25 g oral glucose is well tolerated and leads to reliable secretion of gut hormones. Fasting glucose, insulin and C-peptide are normalized, while glucagon-like peptide 1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and peptide tyrosine tyrosine are overcorrected. Pouch emptying is accelerated after LRYGB.",10.1016/j.soard.2015.11.022,,,,1413

219,Duodenal Switch vs. Single-Anastomosis Duodenal Switch (SADI-S) for the Treatment of Grade IV Obesity: 5-Year Outcomes of a Multicenter Prospective Cohort Comparative Study.,"The aims were to compare the 5-year outcomes of duodenal switch (DS) and single-anastomosis duodenal switch (SADI-S) in terms of weight loss; remission of comorbidities; nutritional status short- and long-term complications; postoperative mortality; and need for revisional surgery. Multicenter prospective observational study of all consecutive patients undergoing DS or SADI-S in three high-volume hospitals. A total of 87 patients were included in the study, 43 submitted to DS and 44 to SADI-S, with similar basal characteristics, nutritional parameters, and BMI (52.9Â kg/m2 DS vs. 52.5Â kg/m2 SADI-S). Operative time was 152Â min (Â±â€‰32.6) in DS vs. 116Â min (Â±â€‰21.9) in SADI-S (pâ€‰=â€‰0.043). Short-term complications were similar for DS and SADI-S, both overall (11.8% vs. 11.6%), and ranged as Clavien-Dindoâ€‰>â€‰II (4.5% vs. 4.7%), with no mortality. At 5Â years, DS and SADI-S results were as follows: BMI 30.6 vs. 33.3Â kg/m2 (pâ€‰=â€‰0.023); %EWL 80.5% vs. 68.6% (pâ€‰=â€‰0.006); and %TWL 42.1 vs. 36.0 (pâ€‰=â€‰0.006). Comorbidity remission rates for DS and SADI-S were as follows: for diabetes, 92.8% vs. 85.7% (n.s.); for hypertension, 95.2% vs. 85.1% (n.s.); for sleep apnea, 75% vs. 73.3% (n.s.); and for dyslipidemia, 76.4% vs. 73.3% (n.s.). DS showed lower levels of vitamin B12, iron, vitamin E, and zinc than SADI-S (pâ€‰=â€‰â€‰<â€‰0.005). In the long term, there were 4 surgical reinterventions (due to 1 internal hernia in the DS group and 1 internal hernia and 2 biliary refluxes in the SADI-S group) with no cases of persistent diarrhea or malnutrition. Both DS and SADI-S allowed good weight control and resolution of comorbidities. DS achieved a greater weight loss compared to SADI-S, at the expense of longer operative time and lower vitamin and mineral levels.",10.1007/s11695-022-06317-0,,,,1415
1618,Systemic stress response after laparoscopic and open gastric bypass.,"The magnitude of the systemic stress response is proportional to the degree of operative trauma. We hypothesized that laparoscopic gastric bypass (GBP) is associated with reduced operative trauma compared with open GBP, resulting in a lower systemic stress response. Forty-eight patients with a body mass index of 40 to 60 were randomly assigned to laparoscopic (n = 26) or open (n = 22) GBP Blood samples were measured at baseline and at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively. Metabolic (insulin, glucose, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, ACTH, cortisol), acute phase (C-reactive protein), and cytokine (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) responses were measured. Catabolic response was also measured by calculating the nitrogen balance at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. The two groups of patients were similar in terms of age, gender, and preoperative body mass index. The mean operative time was longer for laparoscopic GBP than for open GBP (229 +/- 50 versus 207 43 minutes). After laparoscopic and open GBP, plasma concentrations of insulin, glucose, epinephrine, dopamine, and cortisol increased; IL-8 and TNF-alpha remained unchanged; and negative nitrogen balances occurred at 24 and 48 hours. There was no significant difference in these parameters between groups. Concentrations of norepinephrine, ACTH, C-reactive protein, and IL-6 levels also increased, but these levels were significantly lower after laparoscopic GBP than after open GBP (p < 0.05). Systemic stress response after laparoscopic GBP is similar to that after open GBP, except that concentrations of norepinephrine, ACTH, C-reactive protein, and IL-6 are lower after laparoscopic than after open GBP. These findings may suggest a lower degree of operative injury after laparoscopic GBP.",10.1016/s1072-7515(02)01132-8,,,,1416
1255,Effects of ingestion routes on hormonal and metabolic profiles in gastric-bypassed humans.,"Gastric bypass surgery (GBP) results in the rapid resolution of type 2 diabetes. Most studies aiming to explain the underlying mechanisms are limited to data obtained after a postsurgical recovery period, making assessment of confounding influences from, for example, weight loss and altered nutrient intake difficult. To examine the impact of GBP on hormonal and metabolite profiles under conditions of identical nutrient intake independent of weight loss, we studied GBP patients fitted with a gastrostomy tube to enable the administration of nutrients to bypassed segments of the gut. Thus, this model allowed us to simulate partially the preoperative condition and compare this with the postoperative situation in the same patient. Patients (n = 4) were first given a mixed meal test (MMT) orally and then via the gastrostomy tube, preceded by overnight and 2-hour fasting, respectively. Blood samples were assessed for hormones and metabolites. The oral MMT yielded 4.6-fold increase in plasma insulin (P < .05), 2-fold in glucagon-like peptide-1 (P < .05), and 2.5-fold in glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (P < .05) plasma levels, compared with the gastrostomy MMT. The changes in hormone levels were accompanied by elevated branched-chain amino acid levels (1.4-2-fold, P < .05) and suppressed fatty acid levels (âˆ¼50%, P < .05). These data, comparing identical nutrient delivery, demonstrate markedly higher incretin and insulin responses after oral MMT than after gastric MMT, thereby providing a potential explanation for the rapid remission of type 2 diabetes observed after GBP. The simultaneous increase in branched-chain amino acid questions its role as a marker for insulin resistance.",10.1210/jc.2012-3996,,,,1417
1564,Nitrous oxide and laparoscopic bariatric surgery.,"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is frequently used to supplement more potent anesthetic agents. One side-effect of N2O is its ability to expand an air-containing space. We investigated if N2O adversely affected operating conditions by distending normal bowel during laparoscopic bariatric procedures. 50 morbidly obese patients were divided into 2 study groups. Group 1 patients were ventilated with a halogenated anesthetic/oxygen/air mixture, while Group 2 received a halogenated anesthetic/oxygen/N2O mixture. At 30, 60, and 90 min intervals during the operation, the surgeon was asked if N2O was being used. The surgeons responded correctly only 42% (30 min), 50% (60 min), and 48% (90 min) of the time. In Group 2 (N2O) patients, they incorrectly answered that N2O was not being used 88% (30 min), 68% (60 min), and 68% (90 min); and in Group 1 (air) patients, they incorrectly answered that N2O was being used 28% (30 min), 32% (60 min), and 36% (90 min) of the time. We found that using N2O did not cause noticeable bowel distention during laparoscopic bariatric procedures of relatively short duration.",10.1381/0960892053723286,,,,1418
1481,The decline in hip bone density after gastric bypass surgery is associated with extent of weight loss.,"Bariatric surgery is common and may be associated with deleterious effects on the skeleton. Our objective was to assess bone metabolism and bone mineral density (BMD) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. We conducted a 1-yr prospective longitudinal study at a university hospital bariatric surgery practice and metabolic bone disease unit. Participants included 23 obese (mean body mass index 47 kg/m(2)) men and women, aged 20-64 yr. Serum PTH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, osteocalcin, and urinary N-telopeptide, and BMD were assessed. Patients lost 45 +/- 2 kg 1 yr postoperatively (P < 0.01). PTH increased early (3 months, 43-50 pg/ml; P < 0.001) and urinary calcium dropped (161-92 mg/24 h; P < 0.01), despite doubling of calcium intake (1318-2488 mg/d; P < 0.001). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were unchanged (23-26 ng/ml), although vitamin D intake increased by 260% (658 IU/d at baseline to 1698 IU/d at 12 months; P < 0.05). Markers of bone remodeling rose (P < 0.01 for both urinary N-telopeptide and osteocalcin), whereas BMD decreased at the femoral neck (9.2%, P < 0.005) and at the total hip (8.0%, P < 0.005). These declines were strongly associated with the extent of weight loss (femoral neck: r = 0.90, P < 0.0001; and total hip: r = 0.65, P = 0.02). Lumbar spine and distal radius sites did not change. After Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, there was evidence of calcium and vitamin D malabsorption. Bone turnover increased, and hip bone density rapidly declined. The decline in hip BMD was strongly associated with weight loss itself. Vigilance for nutritional deficiencies and bone loss in patients both before and after bariatric surgery is crucial.",10.1210/jc.2008-0481,,,,1419
1383,Altered plasma response to zinc and iron tolerance test after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"The duodenum and proximal jejunum are excluded after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass but these intestinal sites are where iron and zinc are most absorbed. Therefore, they are among the nutrients whose digestive and absorptive process can be impaired after surgery. The aim of the present study was to investigate the iron and zinc plasma response to a tolerance test before and after bariatric surgery. The study was performed at SÃ£o Paulo University School of Medicine of RibeirÃ£o Preto, Brazil. In a longitudinal paired study, 9 morbidly obese women (body mass index â‰¥40 kg/m(2)) underwent an iron and zinc tolerance test before and 3 months after surgery. The iron and zinc levels were determined at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after a physiologic unique oral dose. The mineral concentrations in the plasma and 24-hour urine sample were assayed using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The anthropometric measurements and 3-day food record were also evaluated. A linear mixed model was used to compare the plasma concentration versus interval after the oral dose, before and after surgery. The pre- and postoperative test results revealed a significantly lower plasma zinc response (P <.01) and a delayed response to iron intake after surgery. The total plasma iron concentration area, during the 4 hours, was not different after surgery (P >.05). The 24-hour urinary iron and zinc excretion did not differ between the pre- and postoperative phases. The present data showed a compromised response to the zinc tolerance test after gastric bypass surgery, suggesting an impaired absorption of zinc. More attention must be devoted to zinc nutritional status after surgery.",10.1016/j.soard.2011.01.041,,,,1420
1407,Skin vasodilator function and vasomotion in patients with morbid obesity: effects of gastric bypass surgery.,"Obesity-associated microvascular dysfunction (MVD) involves different body tissues, including skin, and concurs to increased cardiovascular risk in obese patients (Ob-P). Generalized improvement of MVD is an important goal in obesity treatment. Since skin MVD mirrors generalized systemic MVD, skin microvascular investigation in prospective studies in Ob-P may surrogate microvascular investigation in organs more important for cardiovascular risk of the studied patients. In this prospective study, we measured forearm skin post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia (PORH), as percentage flow increase from baseline, and skin vasomotion in 37 Ob-P before Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and in 24 of them about 1 year after RYGB, using laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). The spectral contribution of skin LDF signal oscillations in the frequency intervals of 0.01-0.02 Hz, 0.02-0.06 Hz, and 0.06-0.2 Hz--corresponding to endothelial-, sympathetic-, and myogenic-dependent vasomotion, respectively, was measured by means of spectral Fourier analysis. The same measurements were also performed in 28 healthy, lean subjects (HLS). Before RYGB, Ob-P had a significant reduction in PORH and in the all vasomotion parameters investigated, compared with HLS. After RYGB, Ob-P who completed the follow-up, had a significant weight loss (âˆ¼40 kg on average), together with a full normalisation in PORH and in vasomotion parameters, regardless of diabetes status. Surgically induced sustained weight loss resulted in full normalisation of skin microvascolar function in Ob-P about 1 year after RYGB. This result suggests a beneficial effect of sustained weight loss on generalized MVD of the studied Ob-P.",10.1007/s11695-010-0286-9,,,,1421
1439,Atomised lidocaine for airway topical anaesthesia in the morbidly obese: 1% compared with 2%.,"Airway anaesthesia using atomised lidocaine for awake oral fibreoptic intubation in morbidly obese patients was evaluated using two doses of local anaesthetic. In this randomised, blinded prospective study, 40 ml of atomised 1% (n = 11) or 2% (n = 10) lidocaine was administered with high oxygen flow as carrier. Outcomes included time for intubation, patient tolerance to airway manipulation, haemodynamic parameters, the bronchoscopist's overall satisfaction, and serial serum lidocaine concentrations. Patients receiving lidocaine 1% had a longer mean (SD) time from the start of topicalisation to tracheal tube cuff inflation than those receiving lidocaine 2% (8.6 (0.9) min vs 6.9 (0.5) min, respectively; p < 0.05). Patients in the 1% cohort demonstrated increased responses to airway manipulation (p < 0.0001), reflecting lower bronchoscopist's satisfaction scores (p < 0.03). Haemodynamic responses to topicalisation and airway manipulation were similar in both groups. Peak plasma concentration was lower in the 1% group (mean (SD) 1.4 (0.3) and 3.8 (0.5) microg.ml(-1), respectively; p < 0.001). Airway anaesthesia using atomised lidocaine for awake oral fibreoptic intubation in the morbidly obese is efficacious, rapid and safe. Compared with lidocaine 1%, the 2% dose provides superior intubating conditions.",10.1111/j.1365-2044.2009.06126.x,,,,1422
565,Diagnostic and Therapeutic Management of Post-Gastric Bypass Chronic Diarrhea: a Systematic Review.,"There is a lack of recommendation regarding exploration and treatment of chronic diarrhea following gastric bypass, while it is a common side effect of this surgery. The electronic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched until July 2018. Of the 553 articles identified, 35 articles were included. Intestinal bacterial overgrowth and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency are the main etiologies of diarrhea following gastric bypass. The diagnostic approach must begin by eliminating infectious causes of diarrhea. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency can be diagnosed with fecal fat quantification or fecal elastase 1 level evaluation. A positive lactulose breath test confirms suspicion of small intestine bacterial overgrowth. In conclusion, we propose sequential exploration and treatment of the possible etiologies of diarrhea depending on clinical symptoms.",10.1007/s11695-019-04253-0,,,,1423
1598,Effects of pneumoperitoneum on intraoperative pulmonary mechanics and gas exchange during laparoscopic gastric bypass.,"Hypercarbia and elevated intraabdominal pressure resulting from carbon dioxide (CO2) pneumoperitoneum can adversely affect respiratory mechanics. This study examined the changes in mechanical ventilation, CO2 homeostasis, and pulmonary gas exchange in morbidly obese patients undergoing a laparoscopic or open gastric bypass (GBP) procedure. In this study, 58 patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 to 60 kg/m2 were randomly allocated to laparoscopic ( n = 31) or open ( n = 27) GBP. Minute ventilation was adjusted to maintain a low normal arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2), low normal end-tidal partial pressure of CO2 (ETCO2), and low airway pressure. Respiratory compliance, ETCO2, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), total exhaled CO2 per minute (VCO2), and pulse oximetry (SO2) were measured at 30-min intervals. The acid-base balance was determined by arterial blood gas analysis at 1-h intervals. The pulmonary gas exchange was evaluated by calculation of the alveolar dead space-to-tidal volume ratio (V(Dalv)/V(T)) and alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (PAO2-PaO2). The two groups were similar in age, gender, and BMI. As compared with open GBP, laparoscopic GBP resulted in higher ETCO2, PIP, and VCO2, and a lower respiratory compliance. Arterial blood gas analysis demonstrated higher PaCO2 and lower pH during laparoscopic GBP than during open GBP ( p < 0.05). The V(Dalv)/V(T) ratio and PAO2-PaO2 gradient did not change significantly during laparoscopic GBP. Intraoperative oxygen desaturation (SO2 < 90%) did not develop in any of the patients in either group. Laparoscopic GBP alters intraoperative pulmonary mechanics and acid-base balance but does not significantly affect pulmonary oxygen exchange. Changes in pulmonary mechanics are well tolerated in morbidly obese patients when proper ventilator adjustments are maintained.",10.1007/s00464-002-8786-x,,,,1424
179,Tripeptide gut hormone infusion does not alter food preferences or sweet taste function in volunteers with obesity and prediabetes/diabetes but promotes restraint eating: A secondary analysis of a randomized single-blind placebo-controlled study.,"To investigate whether the elevation in postprandial concentrations of the gut hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), oxyntomodulin (OXM) and peptide YY (PYY) accounts for the beneficial changes in food preferences, sweet taste function and eating behaviour after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). This was a secondary analysis of a randomized single-blind study in which we infused GLP-1, OXM, PYY (GOP) or 0.9% saline subcutaneously for 4â€‰weeks in 24 subjects with obesity and prediabetes/diabetes, to replicate their peak postprandial concentrations, as measured at 1 month in a matched RYGB cohort (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01945840). A 4-day food diary and validated eating behaviour questionnaires were completed. Sweet taste detection was measured using the method of constant stimuli. Correct sucrose identification (corrected hit rates) was recorded, and sweet taste detection thresholds (EC50s: half maximum effective concencration values) were derived from concentration curves. The intensity and consummatory reward value of sweet taste were assessed using the generalized Labelled Magnitude Scale. Mean daily energy intake was reduced by 27% with GOP but no significant changes in food preferences were observed, whereas a reduction in fat and increase in protein intake were seen post-RYGB. There was no change in corrected hit rates or detection thresholds for sucrose detection following GOP infusion. Additionally, GOP did not alter the intensity or consummatory reward value of sweet taste. A significant reduction in restraint eating, comparable to the RYGB group was observed with GOP. The elevation in plasma GOP concentrations after RYGB is unlikely to mediate changes in food preferences and sweet taste function after surgery but may promote restraint eating.",10.1111/dom.15028,,,,1425
1469,Treatment of vitamin D depletion after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a randomized prospective clinical trial.,"A high prevalence (60%) of vitamin D (VitD) depletion, defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of < or =20 ng/mL, is present in preoperative morbidly obese patients. Despite daily supplementation with 800 IU VitD and 1500 mg calcium after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), VitD depletion persists in almost one half (44%) of patients. However, the optimal management of VitD depletion after RYGB and the potential benefits of such treatment are currently unknown. A total of 60 VitD-depleted morbidly obese women were randomly assigned to receive 50,000 IU of VitD weekly after RYGB (group 1; n = 30) or no additional VitD after RYGB (group 2; n = 30). All patients received a daily supplement of 800 IU VitD and 1500 mg calcium. The serum calcium, parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, urinary N-telopeptide, and bone mineral density were measured preoperatively and 1 year after RYGB. Questionnaires were used to assess other potential sources of VitD, including sunlight exposure and ingestion of VitD-containing foods/liquids. At 1 year after RYGB, VitD depletion and mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D level had improved significantly in group 1 (14% and 37.8 ng/mL, respectively) compared with the values in group 2 (85% and 15.2 ng/mL, respectively; P <.001 for both). A significant 33% retardation in hip bone mineral density decline (P = .043) and a significantly greater resolution of hypertension was seen in group 1 (75% versus 32%; P = .029). No significant adverse effects were encountered from pharmacologic VitD therapy. The results of our study have shown that 50,000 IU of VitD weekly after RYGB safely corrects VitD depletion in most women, attenuates cortical bone loss, and improves resolution of hypertension.",10.1016/j.soard.2008.08.004,,,,1426
199,Exercise modifies hypothalamic connectivity and brain functional networks in women after bariatric surgery: a randomized clinical trial.,"Obesity is a disease that may involve disrupted connectivity of brain networks. Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for obesity, and the positive effects on obesity-related conditions may be enhanced by exercise. Herein, we aimed to investigate the possible synergistic effects of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) and exercise training on brain functional networks. Thirty women eligible for bariatric surgery were randomly assigned to a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB: nâ€‰=â€‰15, ageâ€‰=â€‰41.0â€‰Â±â€‰7.3 years) or RYGB plus Exercise Training (RYGBâ€‰+â€‰ET: nâ€‰=â€‰15, ageâ€‰=â€‰41.9â€‰Â±â€‰7.2 years). Clinical, laboratory, and brain functional connectivity parameters were assessed at baseline, and 3 (POST3) and 9 months (POST9) after surgery. The 6-month, three-times-a-week, exercise intervention (resistance plus aerobic exercise) was initiated 3 months post-surgery (for RYGBâ€‰+â€‰ET). Exercise superimposed on bariatric surgery (RYGBâ€‰+â€‰ET) increased connectivity between hypothalamus and sensorial regions (seed-to-voxel analyses of hypothalamic connectivity), and decreased default mode network (DMN) and posterior salience (pSAL) network connectivity (ROI-to-ROI analyses of brain networks connectivity) when compared to RYGB alone (all p-FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Increases in basal ganglia (BG) network connectivity were only observed in the exercised training group (within-group analyses). Exercise training is an important component in the management of post-bariatric patients and may improve the hypothalamic connectivity and brain functional networks that are involved in controlling food intake.

302,Is mechanical bowel preparation necessary in bariatric surgery?,"Historically, mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) is performed prior to bariatric procedures; but our counter parts in colorectal surgery have shown that no-MBP is non-inferior to MBP, in regard to post-operative complications. The purpose of our study was to show that no-MBP prior to bariatric surgery is also non-inferior to MBP. A prospective, randomized, controlled trial was conducted on patients undergoing bariatric surgical procedures (Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass, or Sleeve Gastrectomy). We randomized patients to MBP and no-MBP. Number of post-operative complications (intraabdominal abscess, anastomotic leak, acute kidney injury, dehydration), readmission, and wound infection for 30 days post-procedure was recorded. A total of 139 patients were enrolled with 71 in the MBP group and 68 in the no-MBP group. Complication rates were similar between the MBP and no-MBP (12.7% vs. 10.2%, respectively; pÂ =Â 0.660). Median hospital length of stay was similar for MBP and no-MBP (1 vs. 1 day, respectively; pÂ =Â 0.782). Hospital readmissions for MBP vs. no-MBP was, 4.4% vs. 5.6%, respectively (pÂ =Â 1.000). Mechanical bowel preparation is likely not necessary prior to bariatric procedures.",10.1016/j.amjsurg.2022.01.021,,,,1428
899,Type 2 Diabetes Remission After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: Evidence for Increased Expression of Jejunal Genes Encoding Regenerating Pancreatic Islet-Derived Proteins as a Potential Mechanism.,"Intestinal expression of regenerating pancreatic islet-derived protein-encoding genes (REG) would be enhanced after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and would affect postoperative type 2 diabetes remission (T2Dr). Intestinal biopsy samples were collected from 20 adult obese women with T2D before and 3Â months after RYGB. Levels of REG expression and the gene encoding its putative receptor (EXTL3) were assessed by microarray and validated by quantitative RT-PCR. T2Dr was assessed according to ADA criteria 1Â year after RYGB. After RYGB, only patients with T2Dr had significantly increased REG1Î± and REG3Î³ expression in the jejunum, as validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Our data provide support for the hypothesis that increased jejunal expression of REG genes after RYGB affects T2Dr, possibly by playing an endocrine function.",10.1007/s11695-017-2602-0,,,,1429
278,Changes of Circulating Irisin and High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein Levels in Morbidly Obese Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.,"Background: Irisin has been recently reported to provide beneficial effects in obesity and diabetes. Elevation of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) reflects the inflammatory state that has been shown to play a key role in obesity and its comorbidities. Objective: Our study aimed to compare the changes of circulating irisin levels in an obese diabetic population who underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) versus a control-matched population who underwent usual medical care plus diabetes support education (DSE) program. In addition, we aimed to explore the association between circulating irisin and hs-CRP levels after the interventions. Methods: In a prospective controlled trial, we studied 58 obese individuals with type 2 diabetes before and 12 months after intervention. Twenty-nine subjects underwent LRYGB and 29 subjects received DSE. Results: At 12-month follow-up, compared with the DSE group, patients who underwent LRYGB lost more weight (LRYGB; -33.4â€‰Â±â€‰11.2, and DSE; 0.2â€‰Â±â€‰4.9â€‰kg; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001), fat mass (Pâ€‰<â€‰.001), and fat-free mass (Pâ€‰<â€‰.05). Circulating irisin (Pâ€‰<â€‰.05) and hs-CRP level (Pâ€‰<â€‰.05) were also significantly lower. Within the LRYGB group, the reduction of irisin level was positively associated with the changes of hs-CRP levels (râ€‰=â€‰0.39, Pâ€‰<â€‰.05). Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing that LRYGB significantly reduces circulating irisin levels compared with usual medical care and DSE, in an obese diabetic population. After LRYGB, the irisin reduction significantly correlates with the reduction of hs-CRP. The elevation of circulating irisin levels suggests irisin resistance in the obese state and its decrease after LRYGB might reflect the resolution of irisin resistance. Future investigations are needed to confirm and explore the mechanisms of irisin resistance in obesity, its resolution after LRYGB, and the pathophysiological significance.",10.1089/lap.2021.0558,,,,1430
1019,"Differential Acute Impacts of Sleeve Gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery and Matched Caloric Restriction Diet on Insulin Secretion, Insulin Effectiveness and Non-Esterified Fatty Acid Levels Among Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.","Bariatric surgery is an increasingly common option for control of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Mechanisms underlying rapid improvement of T2D after different types of bariatric surgery are not clear. Caloric deprivation and altered levels of non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) have been proposed. This study examines how sleeve gastrectomy (SG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GBP) or matched hypocaloric diet (DT) achieves improvements in T2D by characterising components of the glucose metabolism and NEFA levels before and 3Â days after each intervention. Plasma samples at five time points during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) from subjects with T2D undergoing GBP (Nâ€‰=â€‰11) or SG (Nâ€‰=â€‰12) were analysed for C-peptide, insulin and glucose before surgery and 3-day post-intervention or after DT (Nâ€‰=â€‰5). Fasting palmitic, linoleic, oleic and stearic acid were measured. C-peptide measurements were used to model insulin secretion rate (ISR) using deconvolution. Subjects who underwent GBP surgery experienced the greatest improvement in glycaemia (median reduction in blood glucose (BG) from basal by 29Â % [IQR -57, -18]) and the greatest reduction in all NEFA measured. SG achieved improvement in glycaemia with lower ISR and reduction in all but palmitoleic acid. DT subjects achieved improvement in glycaemia with an increase in ISR, 105Â % [IQR, 20, 220] and stearic acid. GBP, SG and DT each improve glucose metabolism through different effects on pancreatic beta cell function, insulin sensitivity and free fatty acids.",10.1007/s11695-015-2038-3,,,,1431
1355,Myocardial oxygen consumption change predicts left ventricular relaxation improvement in obese humans after weight loss.,"Obesity adversely affects myocardial metabolism, efficiency, and diastolic function. Our objective was to determine whether weight loss can ameliorate obesity-related myocardial metabolism and efficiency derangements and that these improvements directly relate to improved diastolic function in humans. We studied 30 obese (BMI >30 kg/m2) subjects with positron emission tomography (PET) (myocardial metabolism, blood flow) and echocardiography (structure, function) before and after marked weight loss from gastric bypass surgery (N = 10) or moderate weight loss from diet (N = 20). Baseline BMI, insulin resistance, hemodynamics, left ventricular (LV) mass, systolic function, myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2), and fatty acid (FA) metabolism were similar between the groups. MVO2/g decreased after diet-induced weight loss (P = 0.009). Total MVO2 decreased after dietary (P = 0.02) and surgical weight loss (P = 0.0006) and was related to decreased BMI (P = 0.006). Total myocardial FA utilization decreased (P = 0.03), and FA oxidation trended lower (P = 0.06) only after surgery. FA esterification and LV efficiency were unchanged. After surgical weight loss, LV mass decreased by 23% (Doppler-derived) E/E' by 33%, and relaxation increased (improved) by 28%. Improved LV relaxation related significantly to decreased BMI, insulin resistance, total MVO2, and LV mass but not FA utilization. Decreased total MVO(2) predicted LV relaxation improvement independent of BMI change (P = 0.02). Weight loss can ameliorate the obesity-related derangements in myocardial metabolism and LV structure and diastolic function. Decreased total MVO2 independently predicted improved LV relaxation, suggesting that myocardial oxygen metabolism may be mechanistically important in determining cardiac relaxation.",10.1038/oby.2011.186,,,,1432
1021,The effect of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel infusion long-term therapy on motor complications in advanced Parkinson's disease: a multicenter Romanian experience.,"Chronic treatment with oral levodopa is associated with an increased frequency of motor complications in the late stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). Continuous administration of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG-Duodopa(Â®), Abbott Laboratories), which has been available in Romania since 2009, represents an option for treating patients with advanced PD. Our primary objective was to report changes in motor complications after initiation of LCIG therapy. The secondary objectives were as follows: to determine the impact of LCIG therapy on the daily levodopa dose variation before/and after LCIG, to collect patient self-assessments of quality of life (QoL), and to study the overall tolerability and safety of LCIG administration. A retrospective analysis (2009-2013) of LCIG therapy and the experience in nine neurology centers in Romania was performed. The impact of LCIG therapy was evaluated by analyzing changes in motor fluctuations, dyskinesia and the patients' QoL after initiating therapy. The safety of LCIG therapy was estimated by noting agent-related adverse events (AEs) and medical device-related AEs. In the 113 patients included, we observed a significant improvement in PD symptoms after initiation of LCIG therapy. The ""on"" period increased, with a mean value of 6.14Â h, and the dyskinesia period was reduced, with a mean value of 29.4Â %. The quantified non-motor symptoms subsided. The patients exhibited significant improvements in QoL scores. There were few AEs and few cases of LCIG therapy discontinuation. LCIG is an important and available therapeutic option for managing patients with advanced PD.",10.1007/s00702-015-1496-z,,,,1433
1450,Significantly altered systemic exposure to atorvastatin acid following gastric bypass surgery in morbidly obese patients.,"The impact of gastric bypass on atorvastatin pharmacokinetics was investigated in 12 morbidly obese patients being treated with 20-80 mg atorvastatin each morning. Eight-hour pharmacokinetic investigations were performed the day before the surgery and at a median of 5 weeks (range 3-6 weeks) after the surgery. Gastric bypass surgery produced a variable effect on individual systemic exposure to atorvastatin acid (area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve from 0 to 8 h postdose (AUC(0-8))), ranging from a threefold decrease to a twofold increase (median ratio = 1.1, P = 0.99). Patients with the highest systemic exposure to atorvastatin before surgery showed reduced exposure after surgery (n = 3, median ratio = 0.4, range = 0.3-0.5, P < 0.01), whereas those with lower systemic exposure before surgery showed a median 1.2-fold increase in atorvastatin AUC(0-8) (n = 9, range = 0.8-2.3, P = 0.03) after surgery. This study indicates that the presurgical first-pass metabolic capacity influences the effect of gastric bypass on atorvastatin bioavailability. Because individual first-pass metabolic capacity is not readily assessable clinically, retitration up to the lowest effective dose should be performed after the surgery.",10.1038/clpt.2009.82,,,,1434
1045,"Exercise and Weight Loss Improve Muscle Mitochondrial Respiration, Lipid Partitioning, and Insulin Sensitivity After Gastric Bypass Surgery.","Both Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery and exercise can improve insulin sensitivity in individuals with severe obesity. However, the impact of RYGB with or without exercise on skeletal muscle mitochondria, intramyocellular lipids, and insulin sensitivity index (SI) is unknown. We conducted a randomized exercise trial in patients (n = 101) who underwent RYGB surgery and completed either a 6-month moderate exercise (EX) or a health education control (CON) intervention. SI was determined by intravenous glucose tolerance test. Mitochondrial respiration and intramyocellular triglyceride, sphingolipid, and diacylglycerol content were measured in vastus lateralis biopsy specimens. We found that EX provided additional improvements in SI and that only EX improved cardiorespiratory fitness, mitochondrial respiration and enzyme activities, and cardiolipin profile with no change in mitochondrial content. Muscle triglycerides were reduced in type I fibers in CON, and sphingolipids decreased in both groups, with EX showing a further reduction in a number of ceramide species. In conclusion, exercise superimposed on bariatric surgery-induced weight loss enhances mitochondrial respiration, induces cardiolipin remodeling, reduces specific sphingolipids, and provides additional improvements in insulin sensitivity.",10.2337/db15-0809,,,,1435

This review aims to critique the evidence on the prevalence of these nutritional deficiencies and the impact on anaemia in the first 12Â months after surgery. PRISMA and MOOSE frameworks, the NHMRC evidence hierarchy and The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics bias tool were used to systematically critique current literature. Seventeen studies reported on deficiency prevalence with the majority being of low quality. Important confounders to serum micronutrient levels were not adequately considered. Results on the prevalence of nutritional anaemias were also lacking. Further investigation into the prevalence of iron, vitamin B12, folate and copper deficiency and its impact on anaemia in bariatric surgery is needed.",10.1007/s11695-020-04872-y,,,,1436
1195,"Fast left prefrontal rTMS reduces post-gastric bypass surgery pain: findings from a large-scale, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial.","A single session of left prefrontal rTMS has been shown to have analgesic effects, and to reduce post-operative morphine use. We sought to test these findings in a larger sample, and try and see if multiple sessions had additive analgesic benefit. 108 patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery received two sessions of 10 Hz rTMS (110% of motor threshold) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (one immediately following surgery and one 4 h later). Participants were randomly assigned to receive 2 sessions of real rTMS, 2 sessions of sham, 1 real then 1 sham, or 1 sham then 1 real rTMS treatments. Patients and study staff were blind to rTMS conditions. Unlike previous rTMS trials for post-operative pain, no differences emerged between groups with respect to total patient-controlled analgesia usage (IV hydromorphone). However, despite no difference in IV analgesic usage, subjects that received 2 real rTMS sessions rated both the affective and sensory dimensions of their pain significantly lower than those in the shamâ€“sham group at several time points during the post-surgical/post-rTMS period. This study suggests that left prefrontal rTMS may produce significant analgesic effects in the perioperative setting. However, further work is needed to understand this effect and attempt to make it clinically useful in light of the lack of effect on PCA hydromorphone use.",10.1016/j.brs.2013.07.007,,,,1437
1287,Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic alterations in the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass recipients.,"We conducted a pharmacokinetic (PK) study and a pharmacodynamic (PD) study to assess whether Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery is associated with significant changes to PK and PD of oral medications. The effect of RYGB on oral drug disposition is not well understood. An oral cocktail of probe drugs for major drug-metabolizing enzymes (caffeine, tolbutamide, omeprazole, dextromethorphan, and oral and intravenous midazolam) was administered to 18 RYGB recipients and 18 controls. Timed blood and urine samples were obtained for PK analyses. Forty mg of oral furosemide was administered to 13 RYGB recipients and 14 controls, and urine and blood samples were collected for assessing furosemidePK, and urine volume and urine sodium excretion for PD analyses. Compared with controls, the RYGB group had significantly lower time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) for caffeine (0.58 Â± 0.5 vs 2.1 Â± 2.2 hours, P < 0.0001), tolbutamide (1.4 Â± 1.8 vs 2.1 Â± 2.2 hours, P = 0.0001), omeprazole (1.1 Â± 1.1 vs 4.4 Â± 1.3 hours, P < 0.0001), and oral midazolam (0.5 Â± 0.2 vs 0.7 Â± 0.4 hours, P < 0.01). However, maximum plasma concentration, half-life, area under the curve, and oral bioavailability were not different. Compared with controls, the RYGB group had brisk natriuresis, with significantly lower tmax for urine sodium (1.3 Â± 0.5 vs 3.1 Â± 2.3 hours, P < 0.02) and correspondingly lower tmax for furosemide (1.8 Â± 0.3 vs 4.2 Â± 1.2 hours, P = 0.006). However, 6-hour urine sodium and 6-hour urine volume were not different between the two groups. RYGB recipients have significantly shorter tmax for the studied orally administered medications, but otherwise no other significant changes in PK were reported.",10.1097/SLA.0b013e31827a0e82,,,,1438
86,Nutrient Deficiency After Bariatric Surgery in Adolescents: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis study aimed to estimate changes in blood nutrient concentrations and nutrient deficiencies in adolescents following bariatric surgery. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and the Web of Science to find studies published between January 2000 and August 2023. Observational studies reporting the mean blood concentration of nutrients before and after bariatric surgery or the proportion of nutrient deficiencies after the surgery in healthy adolescents were selected. Fifteen studies were included. Gastric bypass and sleeve gastrostomy were the most common types of surgery. Vitamin D, iron, or ferritin, vitamin B12, calcium, and folic acid were the most studied nutrients, respectively. Other nutrients examined in the studies included zinc, phosphorus, and albumin. The serum ferritin increased by 21 mcg/L (95% CIâ€‰=â€‰10.0, 32.0 mcg/L) after the surgery, but there were no significant alterations in other nutrients. The postoperative prevalence of low albumin, ferritin, vitamin D, and vitamin B12 levels was 10%, 49%, 41%, and 20%, respectively. Also, 23% had an iron deficiency, and 10% had a calcium deficiency after bariatric surgery. The serum ferritin level increased following bariatric surgery in adolescents. Vitamin D and ferritin deficiencies were estimated to be present in more than one-third of adolescents after the surgery.",10.1007/s11695-023-06955-y,,,,1439
1209,Limited recovery of Î²-cell function after gastric bypass despite clinical diabetes remission.,"The mechanisms responsible for the remarkable remission of type 2 diabetes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) are still puzzling. To elucidate the role of the gut, we compared Î²-cell function assessed during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and an isoglycemic intravenous glucose clamp (iso-IVGC) in: 1) 16 severely obese patients with type 2 diabetes, up to 3 years post-RYGBP; 2) 11 severely obese normal glucose-tolerant control subjects; and 3) 7 lean control subjects. Diabetes remission was observed after RYGBP. Î²-Cell function during the OGTT, significantly blunted prior to RYGBP, normalized to levels of both control groups after RYGBP. In contrast, during the iso-IVGC, Î²-cell function improved minimally and remained significantly impaired compared with lean control subjects up to 3 years post-RYGBP. Presurgery, Î²-cell function, weight loss, and glucagon-like peptide 1 response were all predictors of postsurgery Î²-cell function, although weight loss appeared to be the strongest predictor. These data show that Î²-cell dysfunction persists after RYGBP, even in patients in clinical diabetes remission. This impairment can be rescued by oral glucose stimulation, suggesting that RYGBP leads to an important gastrointestinal effect, critical for improved Î²-cell function after surgery.",10.2337/db13-1176,,,,1440
831,Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery Has Unique Effects on Postprandial FGF21 but Not FGF19 Secretion.,"Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)19 and FGF21 are secreted by the intestine and liver in response to macronutrient intake. Intestinal resection and reconstruction via bariatric surgery may alter their regulation. We tested the hypothesis that weight loss induced by Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, but not matched weight loss induced by laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), increases postprandial plasma FGF19 and FGF21 concentrations. Glucose kinetics and plasma FGF19 and FGF21 responses to mixed meal ingestion and to glucose-insulin infusion during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure, with stable isotope tracer methods, were evaluated in 28 adults with obesity before and after 20% weight loss induced by RYGB (n = 16) or LAGB (n = 12). LAGB- and RYGB-induced weight loss increased postprandial plasma FGF19 concentrations (P < 0.05). However, weight loss after RYGB, but not LAGB, increased postprandial plasma FGF21 concentrations (1875 Â± 330 to 2976 Â± 682 vs 2150 Â± 310 and 1572 Â± 265 pg/mL Ã— 6 hours, respectively). The increase in plasma FGF21 occurred âˆ¼2 hours after the peak in delivery of ingested glucose into systemic circulation. Glucose-insulin infusion increased plasma FGF21, but not FGF19, concentrations. The increase in plasma FGF21 during glucose-insulin infusion was greater after than before weight loss in both surgery groups without a difference between groups, whereas plasma FGF19 was not affected by either procedure. RYGB-induced weight loss has unique effects on postprandial FGF21 metabolism, presumably due to rapid delivery of ingested macronutrients to the small intestine and delivery of glucose to the liver.",10.1210/jc.2017-01295,,,,1441
1173,Effect of carbohydrate restriction in patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is a rare complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. Meals with a high carbohydrate (carb) content and high glycemic index (GI) may provoke these hypoglycemic attacks. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of reducing meal carb content and GI on glycemic responses in patients with post-RYGB hypoglycemia. Fourteen patients with post-RYGB hypoglycemia underwent two meal tests: a mixed meal test (MMT) with a carb content of 30 g and a meal test with the low GI supplement, Glucerna SR 1.5Â® (Glucerna meal test (GMT)). Plasma glucose and serum insulin levels were measured for a period of 6 h. Peak glucose levels were reached at T 30 during GMT and at T 60 during MMT, and they were 1.5 Â± 0.3 mmol/L lower during GMT than during MMT (7.5 Â± 0.4 vs 9.0 Â± 0.4 mmol/L, P < 0.005). GMT induced the most rapid rise in plasma insulin: at T 30 plasma, insulin was 30.7 Â± 8.5 mU/L higher during GMT than during MMT (P < 0.005). None of the carb-restricted meals induced post-prandial hypoglycemia. A 30-g carb-restricted meal may help to prevent post-prandial hypoglycemia in patients with post-RYGB hypoglycemia. The use of a liquid, low GI, supplement offers no additional advantage.",10.1007/s11695-014-1319-6,,,,1442
855,Impairment of body mass reduction-associated activation of brown/beige adipose tissue in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Backgrounds/Objectives:The activity of brown/beige adipose tissue (B/BAT) is inversely proportional to body adiposity. Studies have shown that obese subjects submitted to distinct approaches aimed at reducing body mass present an increase of B/BAT activation. However, it is unknown if this beneficial effect of body mass reduction applies to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, we evaluated the impact of massive body mass reduction obtained as a consequence of bariatric surgery in the cold-induced activation of B/BAT in obese non-diabetic (OND) and obese diabetic (OD) subjects. This is an observational study. Fourteen OND, 14 OD and 11 subjects were included in the study. All obese subjects were submitted to Roux-in-Y gastric bypass and measurements were performed before and 8 months after surgery. B/BAT was evaluated by (18F)-FDG-PET/CT scan and determination of signature transcript expression in specimens obtained in biopsies. Before surgery, mean B/BAT activity and the expression of signature transcripts were similar between OND and OD groups. Eight months after surgery, body mass reduction was similar between the obese groups. Nevertheless, the activity of B/BAT was increased in OND and unchanged in OD subjects. This effect was correlated with a more pronounced improvement of insulin resistance, as evaluated by the hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp, in OND subjects as compared with OD subjects. Body mass reduction has a more efficient effect to induce the activation of B/BAT in non-diabetic than in diabetic subjects. This effect is accompanied by more pronounced insulin sensitivity and serine 473 phosphorylation of Akt in B/BAT of non-diabetic than in diabetic subjects.",10.1038/ijo.2017.152,,,,1443
1289,Protein intake and lean tissue mass retention following bariatric surgery.,"Since current protein intake (PI) recommendations for the bariatric surgery (BS) patient are not supported by conclusive evidence, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between PI and lean tissue mass (LTM) loss following BS. Observational study including patients undergoing gastric bypass (GBP; n = 25) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG; n = 25). Dietary advice and daily PI were assessed prior to, and at 2- and 6-weeks, 4-, 8-, and 12-months after surgery. Body composition was assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). LTM loss as percent of weight loss (%LTM loss) at 4- and 12-months after surgery were the main outcome variables. A PI â‰¥ 60 g/d was associated with lower %LTM loss at 4- (p = 0.030) and 12-months (p = 0.013). Similar results were obtained when a PI â‰¥ 1.1 g/kg of ideal body weight (IBW)/d was considered. Multilinear regression showed the only independent predictor of %LTM loss at 4-months was PI (expressed as g/kg IBW/d) (OR: -0.376, p = 0.017), whereas PI (OR: -0.468, p = 0.001) and surgical technique (OR: 0.399, p = 0.006) predicted 12-months %LTM loss. Our data provide supportive evidence for the PI goals of >60 g/d or 1.1 g/kg IBW/d as a being associated with better LTM preservation in the BS patient.",10.1016/j.clnu.2012.11.007,,,,1444
1351,Zinc absorption and zinc status are reduced after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a randomized study using 2 supplements.,"Micronutrient deficiencies are common in patients undergoing gastric bypass. The effect of this type of surgery on zinc absorption and zinc status is not well known. The objective was to evaluate the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) on zinc status and zinc absorption at different stages after surgery. We hypothesized that zinc status would be significantly impaired after surgery and that this impairment would be less severe in subjects receiving increased supplemental zinc. We also hypothesized that zinc absorption would be lower after surgery. Anthropometric and body-composition variables and dietary and biochemical indexes of zinc status and zinc absorption were determined in 67 severe and morbidly obese women [mean (Â±SD) age: 36.9 Â± 9.8 y; BMI (in kg/m(2)): 45.2 Â± 4.7] who underwent RYGBP. The subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 vitamin-mineral supplementation groups. Measurements were made before and 6, 12, and 18 mo after surgery. Fifty-six subjects completed the 18-mo follow-up. Mean plasma zinc, erythrocyte membrane alkaline phosphatase activity, and the size of the rapidly exchangeable zinc pool decreased after RYGBP. Percentage zinc absorption decreased significantly from 32.3% to 13.6% at 6 mo after RYGBP and to 21% at 18 mo after surgery. No effect of supplement type was observed. Zinc status is impaired after RYGBP, despite the finding that dietary plus supplemental zinc doubled recommended zinc intakes in healthy persons. Zinc absorption capacity is significantly reduced soon after RYGBP, with no major changes until 18 mo after surgery.",10.3945/ajcn.111.018143,,,,1445
1030,Pentraxin 3 and Platelet Activation in Obese Patients After Gastric Banding.,"Circulating pentraxin 3 (PTX3), the main regulator of the inflammatory response, rapidly increases following cardiovascular events, and low PTX3 is associated with high body mass index. We conducted a 12-month longitudinal study, to test the hypothesis that laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB)-induced weight loss was associated with changes in platelet activation markers and PTX3. Twelve obese patients, scheduled to undergo LAGB, were enrolled at the University Obesity Center. Urinary 11-dehydro-thromboxane (Tx)B2excretion rate was measured on radioimmunoassay, and PTX3 and CD40L were determined on immunoassay. Plasma PTX3 increased by 178.8 and 214.9% (P<0.0001), respectively, 6 and 12 months after LAGB. High-sensitivity CRP decreased by 24 and 29.7% (P<0.0001), whereas CD40L decreased by 64.3 and 58.6% (P=0.002), respectively. Urinary 11-dehydro-TxB2decreased from 1,443 to 715 and 564 pg/mg creatinine, respectively 6 months and 12 months after LAGB (P<0.0001). PTX3 was inversely related to platelet activation markers, 11-dehydro-TxB2and CD40L. Moreover, multiple regression analysis on pooled data showed that plasma PTX3 was an independent predictor of urinary 11-dehydro-TxB2. There is an association between inflammation, platelet activation and metabolic dysfunction in obesity, and PTX3 is a key player within these circuits.",10.1253/circj.CJ-15-0721,,,,1446
1143,Bone mineral density and expression of vitamin D receptor-dependent calcium uptake mechanisms in the proximal small intestine after bariatric surgery.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass may lead to impaired calcium uptake. Therefore, operation-specific effects of gastric bypass and vertical banded gastroplasty on bone mineral density (BMD) were examined in a randomized clinical trial. Bone resorption markers and mechanisms of decreased calcium uptake after gastric bypass were investigated using blood and endoscopic samples from two additional patient cohorts. Total BMD and non-weight-bearing skull BMD were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline, and 1 and 6â€‰years after gastric bypass or vertical banded gastroplasty in patients who were not receiving calcium supplements. Bone resorption markers in serum and calcium uptake mechanisms in jejunal mucosa biopsies were analysed after gastric bypass by proteomics including radioimmunoassay, gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. One year after surgery, weight loss was similar after gastric bypass and vertical banded gastroplasty. There was a moderate decrease in skull BMD after gastric bypass, but not after vertical banded gastroplasty (Pâ€‰<â€‰0Â·001). Between 1 and 6â€‰years after gastric bypass, skull BMD and total BMD continued to decrease (Pâ€‰=â€‰0Â·001). C-terminal telopeptide levels in serum had increased twofold by 18â€‰months after gastric bypass. Proteomic analysis of the jejunal mucosa revealed decreased levels of heat-shock protein 90Î², a co-activator of the vitamin D receptor, after gastric bypass. Despite increased vitamin D receptor levels, expression of the vitamin D receptor-regulated calcium transporter protein TRPV6 decreased. BMD decreases independently of weight after gastric bypass. Bone loss might be attributed to impaired calcium absorption caused by decreased activation of vitamin D-dependent calcium absorption mechanisms mediated by heat-shock protein 90Î² and TRPV6.",10.1002/bjs.9626,,,,1447
498,Endoscopic full-thickness suturing plus argon plasma mucosal coagulation versus argon plasma mucosal coagulation alone for weight regain after gastric bypass: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Endoscopic transoral outlet reduction (TORe) has been used to manage weight regain after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. We conducted a meta-analysis to summarize the efficacy and safety of the two most commonly used techniques: full-thickness suturing plus argon plasma mucosal coagulation (ft-TORe) and argon plasma mucosal coagulation alone (APMC-TORe). A literature search of publication databases was performed from their inception to February 2020 forÂ relevant studies. The outcomes of interest were percentage total body weight loss, gastrojejunal anastomosis (GJA) diameter, and adverse events (AEs). The pooled effect estimates were analyzed using a random-effects model. Meta-regression was conducted to identify associations between GJA diameter and weight loss. Nine ft-TORe (nÂ = 737) and 7 APMC-TORe (nÂ = 888) studies were included. APMC-TORe was performed as a series of sessions (mean number of sessions ranging from 1.2 to 3), whereas ft-TORe was mostly performed as a single session. Percentage total body weight loss was 8.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.3%-9.7%), 9.5% (95% CI, 8.1%-11.0%), and 5.8% (95% CI, 4.3%-7.1%) after ft-TORe and 9.0% (95% CI, 4.1%-13.9%), 10.2% (95% CI, 8.4%-12.1%), and 9.5% (95% CI, 5.7%-13.2%) after APMC-TORe at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively, with no weight-loss difference at 3 and 6 months (P > .05). Only one severe AE was observed after APMC-TORe and none after ft-TORe. Stricture formation was the most common AE (ft-TORe 3.3% and APMC-TORe 4.8%, PÂ = .38). All were successfully treated by endoscopic dilation or conservative treatment. Smaller aperture of the post-TORe GJA and greater change in the GJA diameter correlated with greater weight loss in APMC-TORe and numerical trends in ft-TORe. This meta-analysis demonstrates that both ft-TORe and APMC-TORe offer significant and comparable weight-loss outcomes with a high and comparable safety profile. However, APMC-TORe typically required multiple endoscopic sessions. Identifying a goal for the final and change in GJA diameter could be useful treatment targets.",10.1016/j.gie.2020.07.013,,,,1448
20,Full-dose rivaroxaban in patients with a history of bariatric surgery: bridging the knowledge gap through a phase 1 study.,"Bariatric surgery (BS) induces significant changes in gastrointestinal anatomy, potentially influencing the pharmacokinetics of orally administered drugs such as rivaroxaban. This phase 1 study aimed to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of full-dose rivaroxaban in post-BS patients. The ABSORB (Rivaroxaban Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics After Bariatric Surgery and in Morbid Obesity) study was a single-center, nonrandomized, multiple-dose, parallel-design bioequivalence trial. Adult patients with stable weight after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) were compared with subjects with class III obesity and healthy controls. Participants received 20 mg of rivaroxaban daily for 8 days. Post-BS patients exhibited altered rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics, suggesting reduced absorption. Mean area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours after the first dose (RYGB, 1806.8 ng.h/mL; SG, 1648.9 ng.h/mL) was lower compared with that in controls (1893.5 ng.h/mL). At steady state, the area under the concentration-time curve values remained lower in BS groups (RYGB, 2129.9 ng.h/mL; SG, 1946.4 ng.h/mL) than in controls (2224.8 ng.h/mL). The maximum concentration after the first dose was lower in post-RYGB subjects (214.9 ng/mL) than in controls (264.1 ng/mL). This difference was less pronounced at steady state (RYGB, 256.9 ng/mL vs controls, 288.8 ng/mL). Neither BS group met bioequivalence criteria compared with controls, whereas the group with class III obesity met bioequivalence criteria compared with controls at steady state. Rivaroxaban displayed minor pharmacokinetic variations in post-BS patients. Given reported interindividual variability in the general population, these variations are unlikely to be of clinical significance. Our findings support rivaroxaban use in BS patients, emphasizing the need for further research in this area.",10.1016/j.jtha.2024.06.024,,,,1449
1361,Biochemical control of bone loss and stone-forming propensity by potassium-calcium citrate after bariatric surgery.,"Patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery are prone to developing bone loss and kidney stones. The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that an effervescent formulation of potassium calcium citrate (PCC) would avert metabolic complications by providing bioavailable calcium and alkali. A total of 24 patients with RYGB underwent a 2-phase crossover randomized trial comparing PCC and placebo. During the last 2 days of each 2-week phase, the serum and 24-hour urine samples were analyzed for calcium and bone turnover markers, acid base status, and urinary stone risk factors. Compared with placebo, PCC marginally reduced the serum parathyroid hormone level and significantly decreased urinary deoxypyridinoline by 12% (P <.001) and serum type 1 collagen C-telopeptide by 22% (P <.01). PCC significantly increased the net gastrointestinal alkali absorption, citrate, and pH and significantly lowered the urinary net acid excretion (P <.001). The urinary saturation of uric acid decreased significantly (P <.001). The supersaturation of calcium oxalate and brushite did not change despite an increase in calcium and pH. In untreated urine samples with citrate concentrations altered to mimic those of placebo and PCC, calcium oxalate agglomeration was significantly inhibited by PCC. In RYGB patients, PCC supplementation inhibited bone resorption by providing bioavailable calcium, reduced the urinary saturation of uric acid, and increased the inhibitor activity against calcium oxalate agglomeration by providing alkali that increased urinary pH and citrate.",10.1016/j.soard.2011.05.001,,,,1450
826,Elevated Postoperative Endogenous GLP-1 Levels Mediate Effects of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass on Neural Responsivity to Food Cues.,"It has been suggested that weight reduction and improvements in satiety after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) are partly mediated via postoperative neuroendocrine changes. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a gut hormone secreted after food ingestion and is associated with appetite and weight reduction, mediated via effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Secretion of GLP-1 is greatly enhanced after RYGB. We hypothesized that postoperative elevated GLP-1 levels contribute to the improved satiety regulation after RYGB via effects on the CNS. Effects of the GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin 9-39 (Ex9-39) and placebo were assessed in 10 women before and after RYGB. We used functional MRI to investigate CNS activation in response to visual food cues (pictures) and gustatory food cues (consumption of chocolate milk), comparing results with Ex9-39 versus placebo before and after RYGB. After RYGB, CNS activation was reduced in the rolandic operculum and caudate nucleus in response to viewing food pictures (P = 0.03) and in the insula in response to consumption of palatable food (P = 0.003). GLP-1 levels were significantly elevated postoperatively (P < 0.001). After RYGB, GLP-1 receptor blockade resulted in a larger increase in activation in the caudate nucleus in response to food pictures (P = 0.02) and in the insula in response to palatable food consumption (P = 0.002). We conclude that the effects of RYGB on CNS activation in response to visual and gustatory food cues may be mediated by central effects of GLP-1. Our findings provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying the weight-lowering effects of RYGB.",10.2337/dc16-2113,,,,1451
789,Early changes in vitamin B12 uptake and biomarker status following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy.,"Bariatric surgery increases the risk of micronutrient deficiencies, including vitamin B12 (B12) deficiency. We analysed early changes in biomarkers of B12 status following bariatric surgery. We prospectively included adult patients (nÂ =Â 27) referred for either Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) (nÂ =Â 19) or Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) (nÂ =Â 8). Blood samples were drawn before surgery and 2 and 6 months following surgery for measurement of B12, holotranscobalamin (holoTC), and methylmalonic acid (MMA). The B12 absorption capacity was estimated from the increase in plasma holoTC two days after a standardised oral B12 challenge. B12 status decreased following both RYBG and SG. While a decrease in plasma B12 was not evident until 6 months postoperatively, we observed a statistically significant decrease in plasma holoTC and increase in MMA already 2 months postoperatively. These changes were more pronounced at 6 months post surgery. Correspondingly, the B12 absorption capacity was decreased following surgery. HoloTC and MMA were superior to B12 to detect early changes in B12 status following bariatric surgery. Our data challenge the current concept that liver B12 stores secure long-term maintenance of B12 status. They indicate that B12 treatment in pharmacological doses may be warranted immediately after surgery.",10.1016/j.clnu.2018.02.007,,,,1452
1121,Optimization of vitamin suppletion after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery can lower postoperative deficiencies: a randomized controlled trial.,"Iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid deficiencies are among the most common deficiencies occurring after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). The present study evaluates the effectiveness of a specially designed multivitamin supplement (WLS Forte, FitForMe, Rotterdam, the Netherlands) specifically developed for LRYGB patients.A triple-blind, randomized, 12-month study was conducted comparing WLS forte with a standard multivitamin supplement (sMVS) containing approximately 100% of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid. WLS Forte contains vitamin B12 14000% RDA, iron 500% RDA, and folic acid 300% RDA.In total, 148 patients (74 in each group) underwent a LRYGB procedure. Baseline characteristics were similar for both groups. Per protocol analysis demonstrated that sMVS treatment was associated with a decline in ferritin (-24.4â€ŠÂ±â€Š70.1â€ŠÎ¼g/L) and vitamin B12 (-45.9â€ŠÂ±â€Š150.3â€Špmol/L) over 12 months, whereas in WLS Forte patients, ferritin remained stable (+3.2â€ŠÂ±â€Š93.2â€ŠÎ¼g/L) and vitamin B12 increased significantly (+55.1â€ŠÂ±â€Š144.2â€Špmol/L). The number of patients developing ferritin or vitamin B12 deficiency was significantly lower with WLS Forte compared with sMVS (Pâ€Š<â€Š0.05). Iron deficiency (ID) was reduced by 88% after WLS Forte compared with sMVS. Adverse events related to supplement use did not occur.An optimized multivitamin supplement is safe and reduces the development of iron and vitamin B12 deficiencies after LRYGB.",10.1097/MD.0000000000000169,,,,1453
1505,Pressure-controlled ventilation does not improve gas exchange in morbidly obese patients undergoing abdominal surgery.,"Morbid obesity results in marked respiratory pathophysiologic changes that may lead to impaired intraoperative gas exchange. The decelerating inspiratory flow and constant inspiratory airway pressure resulting from pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) may be more adapted to these changes and improve gas exchanges compared with volume-controlled ventilation (VCV). Forty morbidly obese patients scheduled for gastric bypass were included in this study. Total intravenous anesthesia was given using the target-controlled infusion technique. During the first intraoperative hour, VCV was used and the tidal volume was adjusted to keep end-tidal PCO(2) around 35 mmHg. After 1 h, patients were randomly allocated to 30-min VCV followed by 30-min PCV or the opposite sequence using a Siemens Servo 300. FiO(2) was 0.6. During PCV, airway pressure was adjusted to provide the same tidal volume as during VCV. Arterial blood was sampled for gas analysis every 15 min. Ventilatory parameters were also recorded. Peak inspiratory airway pressures were significantly lower during PCV than during VCV (P < 0.0001). The other ventilatory parameters were similar during the two periods of ventilation. PaO(2) and PaCO(2) were not significantly different during PCV and VCV. PCV does not improve gas exchange in morbidly obese patients undergoing gastric bypass compared to VCV.",10.1007/s11695-007-9300-2,,,,1454
1352,Alterations of sucrose preference after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (gastric bypass) patients reportedly have changes in perception and consumption of sweet-tasting foods. This study aimed to further investigate alterations in sweet food intake in rats and sucrose detection in humans after gastric bypass. Wistar rats were randomized to gastric bypass or sham-operations and preference for sucrose (sweet), sodium chloride (salty), citric acid (sour) and quinine hydrochloride (bitter) was assessed with standard two-bottle intake tests (vs. water). Intestinal T1R2 and T1R3 expression and plasma levels of glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) were measured. Furthermore, obese patients and normal weight controls were tested for sucrose taste detection thresholds pre- and postoperatively. Visual analogue scales measuring hedonic perception were used to determine the sucrose concentration considered by patients and controls as ""just about right"" pre- and postoperatively. Gastric bypass reduced the sucrose intake relative to water in rats (p<0.001). Preoperative sucrose exposure reduced this effect. Preference or aversion for compounds representative of other taste qualities in naÃ¯ve rats remained unaffected. Intestinal T1R2 and T1R3 expression was significantly decreased in the alimentary limb while plasma levels of GLP-1 and PYY were elevated after bypass in rats (p=0.01). Bypass patients showed increased taste sensitivity to low sucrose concentrations compared with controls (p<0.05), but both groups considered the same sucrose concentration as ""just about right"" postoperatively. In conclusion, gastric bypass reduces sucrose intake relative to water in sucrose-naÃ¯ve rats, but preoperative sucrose experience attenuates this effect. Changes in sucrose taste detection do not predict hedonic taste ratings of sucrose in bypass patients which remain unchanged. Thus, factors other than the unconditional affective value of the taste may also play a role in determining food preferences after gastric bypass.",10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.07.025,,,,1455
949,Increased glucose-stimulated FGF21 response to oral glucose in obese nondiabetic subjects after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"The positive metabolic outcome of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery may involve fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), in both the fasting state and postprandially. We measured the fasting levels of FGF21 before and after bariatric surgery as well as the postprandial FGF21 responses after a glucose load and after a mixed meal. Observational intervention trial. Eight obese, nondiabetic patients underwent RYGB. Plasma FGF21 was measured both before and after surgery on three different days during oral glucose loads (25 g or 50 g glucose) or a mixed meal. Blood samples were taken right before the meal and at 15-min intervals until 90 min and at 150 min and 210 min relative to the start of the meal. Overall, fasting plasma FGF21 did not change significantly before and after surgery (262 Â± 71 vs 411 Â± 119 pg/ml), but for three subjects, fasting plasma FGF21 increased significantly after surgery. Furthermore, FGF21 levels increased significantly at t = 90 and t = 150 min in response to 50 g glucose, but not after a mixed meal. In conclusion, the observed increase in postprandial plasma FGF21 in response to glucose and the lack of FGF21 response to a mixed meal may have important implications for the physiologic role of FGF21. The increase in postprandial FGF21 in response to glucose in the early postoperative period may contribute to the metabolic improvements observed after gastric bypass.",10.1111/cen.13241,,,,1456
58,"Effect of inulin on breath hydrogen, postprandial glycemia, gut hormone release, and appetite perception in RYGB patients: a prospective, randomized, cross-over pilot study.","Large intestinal fermentation of dietary fiber may control meal-related glycemia and appetite via the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY). We investigated whether this mechanism contributes to the efficacy of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) by assessing the effect of oligofructose-enriched inulin (inulin) vs. maltodextrin (MDX) on breath hydrogen (a marker of intestinal fermentation), plasma SCFAs, gut hormones, insulin and blood glucose concentrations as well as appetite in RYGB patients. Eight RYGB patients were studied on two occasions before and ~8 months after surgery using a cross-over design. Each patient received 300â€‰ml orange juice containing 25â€‰g inulin or an equicaloric load of 15.5â€‰g MDX after an overnight fast followed by a fixed portion snack served 3â€‰h postprandially. Blood samples were collected over 5â€‰h and breath hydrogen measured as well as appetite assessed using visual analog scales. Surgery increased postprandial secretion of GLP-1 and PYY (Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.05); lowered blood glucose and plasma insulin increments (Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.05) and reduced appetite ratings in response to both inulin and MDX. The effect of inulin on breath hydrogen was accelerated after surgery with an increase that was earlier in onset (2.5â€‰h vs. 3â€‰h, Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.05), but less pronounced in magnitude. There was, however, no effect of inulin on plasma SCFAs or plasma GLP-1 and PYY after the snack at 3â€‰h, neither before nor after surgery. Interestingly, inulin appeared to further potentiate the early-phase glucose-lowering and second-meal (3-5â€‰h) appetite-suppressive effect of surgery with the latter showing a strong correlation with early-phase breath hydrogen concentrations. RYGB surgery accelerates large intestinal fermentation of inulin, however, without measurable effects on plasma SCFAs or plasma GLP-1 and PYY. The glucose-lowering and appetite-suppressive effects of surgery appear to be potentiated with inulin.",10.1038/s41387-024-00267-5,,,,1457
1524,Effect of marked weight loss on adiponectin gene expression and plasma concentrations.,"Adiponectin is the most abundant protein secreted by adipose tissue and is inversely associated with adiposity and insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that marked weight loss, induced by gastric bypass surgery (GBS), would increase adiponectin gene expression in both upper and lower subcutaneous body fat and increase plasma adiponectin concentration. Adiponectin subcutaneous abdominal and femoral adipose tissue gene expression, determined by using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and adiponectin plasma concentrations, determined by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were evaluated in six extremely obese women (BMI = 57.1 +/- 4.1 kg/m2) before and 1 year after GBS. After GBS, subjects lost 36 +/- 5% of their initial body weight and showed increased insulin sensitivity, manifested by a marked decrease in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance from 10.7 +/- 4.1 to 1.4 +/- 0.3 (p < 0.05). Adiponectin gene expression increased 8- to 15-fold in subcutaneous abdominal and femoral adipose tissues (p < 0.05). Plasma adiponectin concentrations increased from 5.2 +/- 0.9 to 8.4 +/- 1.2 mug/mL (p < 0.05). These data show that marked weight loss induced by GBS increases adiponectin gene expression in both upper- and lower-body subcutaneous fat. The increase in adipose tissue adiponectin production resulted in an increase in plasma adiponectin concentrations, which likely contributed to the decrease in insulin resistance observed after weight loss.",10.1038/oby.2007.556,,,,1458
1340,The flow angle beneath the gastrojejunostomy predicts delayed gastric emptying in Roux-en-Y reconstruction after distal gastrectomy.,"Delayed gastric emptying without mechanical obstruction after Roux-en-Y reconstruction has been defined as Roux stasis syndrome. It occurs in 10-30% of patients after such reconstruction. So far, the cause of this stasis has not been completely identified. This study aimed to reduce Roux stasis using surgical techniques. From November 2007 to October 2010, we performed 101 distal gastrectomies with Roux-en-Y reconstruction. All the gastrojejunostomies were performed with end-to-end anastomoses. Roux stasis was analyzed with respect to tumor location, extent of the dissection, tumor progression, operation time, antecolic/retrocolic reconstruction, and the shape of the gastrojejunostomy. The shape of the gastrojejunostomy was evaluated by contrast gastroradiography 4 days after the operation. Roux stasis syndrome was observed in 17 of the 101 patients. There was no relationship between the extent of the dissection, tumor progression, or operation time and the occurrence of Roux stasis. There was no difference in the incidence of Roux stasis between antecolic and retrocolic reconstructions. However, the group that displayed a straight anastomotic shape on contrast radiography demonstrated an apparently lower incidence of Roux stasis (p = 0.0003). In addition, Roux-en-Y reconstruction following gastric cancer was more frequently followed by Roux stasis in the antrum than in the midstomach (p = 0.0036). Cases of Roux stasis occurred 11.8 days after surgery on average and resolved within 2 weeks on average. Our findings demonstrate the substantial benefits of a straight anastomosis of the gastrojejunostomy for the prevention of Roux stasis syndrome.",10.1007/s10120-011-0107-4,,,,1459
1016,Effects of endogenous GLP-1 and GIP on glucose tolerance after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.,"Exaggerated secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is important for postprandial glucose tolerance after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), whereas the role of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) remains to be resolved. We aimed to explore the relative importance of endogenously secreted GLP-1 and GIP on glucose tolerance and Î²-cell function after RYGB. We used DPP-4 inhibition to enhance concentrations of intact GIP and GLP-1 and the GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin-(9-39) (Ex-9) for specific blockage of GLP-1 actions. Twelve glucose-tolerant patients were studied after RYGB in a randomized, placebo-controlled, 4-day crossover study with standard mixed-meal tests and concurrent administration of placebo, oral sitagliptin, Ex-9 infusion, or combined Ex-9-sitagliptin. GLP-1 receptor antagonism increased glucose excursions, clearly attenuated Î²-cell function, and aggravated postprandial hyperglucagonemia compared with placebo, whereas sitagliptin had no effect despite two- to threefold increased concentrations of intact GLP-1 and GIP. Similarly, sitagliptin did not affect glucose tolerance or Î²-cell function during GLP-1R blockage. This study confirms the importance of GLP-1 for glucose tolerance after RYGB via increased insulin and attenuated glucagon secretion in the postprandial state, whereas amplification of the GIP signal (or other DPP-4-sensitive glucose-lowering mechanisms) did not appear to contribute to the improved glucose tolerance seen after RYGB.",10.1152/ajpendo.00471.2015,,,,1460
660,"A Pilot, Randomized Study in Women of Nutrition-Related Clinical Chemistry at 6Â Weeks after Roux en Y Gastric Bypass: Comparison of Two Nutrition Support Plans.","The current pilot study tested a twofold hypothesis: some nutrition-related chemical measures change by 6Â weeks after Roux en Y Gastric Bypass (RNYGB); one of two nutrition support plans will prevent chemical signs of nutrition problems at 6Â weeks better than the other. After RNYGB, nutrition support should begin right away. However, studies on nutritional status mostly examine subjects much later. In addition, little attention has been paid to optimizing nutrition support plans. Premenopausal females scheduled for RNYGB were given either a commercially available meal replacement product (2 servings/day)â€‰+â€‰other supplements or just a new meal replacement (2 servings/day). The latter included some nutrient versions that might enhance absorption. Blood and urine samples were taken before and 6Â weeks after surgery. In both groups, plasma vitamin D and B12 did not change, plasma osteopontin and vascular endothelial growth factor rose, while plasma retinol binding protein and a bone resorption marker declined. Copper status changes differed between groups based on plasma ceruloplasmin. Iron status improved in both groups (ferritin to c-reactive protein ratios). With the new formulation, magnesium status may have improved, urinary potassium rose, and blood sugar fell. In the other group, a liver damage marker increased, while homocysteine decreased. Nutrition-related parameters showed varying trends 6Â weeks after RNYGB. Some of the trends were affected by the type of nutritional support provided.",10.1007/s11695-019-03895-4,,,,1461
974,Energy restriction and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass reduce postprandial Î±-dicarbonyl stress in obese women with type 2 diabetes.,"Dicarbonyl compounds are formed as byproducts of glycolysis and are key mediators of diabetic complications. However, evidence of postprandial Î±-dicarbonyl formation in humans is lacking, and interventions to reduce Î±-dicarbonyls have not yet been investigated. Therefore, we investigated postprandial Î±-dicarbonyl levels in obese women without and with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, we evaluated whether a diet very low in energy (very low calorie diet [VLCD]) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) reduces Î±-dicarbonyl stress in obese women with type 2 diabetes. In lean (nâ€‰=â€‰12) and obese women without (nâ€‰=â€‰27) or with type 2 diabetes (nâ€‰=â€‰27), we measured the Î±-dicarbonyls, methylglyoxal (MGO), glyoxal (GO) and 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG), and glucose in fasting and postprandial plasma samples obtained during a mixed meal test. Obese women with type 2 diabetes underwent either a VLCD or RYGB. Three weeks after the intervention, individuals underwent a second mixed meal test. Obese women with type 2 diabetes had higher fasting and particularly higher postprandial plasma Î±-dicarbonyl levels, compared with those without diabetes. After three weeks of a VLCD, postprandial Î±-dicarbonyl levels in diabetic women were significantly reduced (AUC MGO -14%, GO -16%, 3-DG -25%), mainly through reduction of fasting plasma Î±-dicarbonyls (MGO -13%, GO -13%, 3-DG -33%). Similar results were found after RYGB. This study shows that type 2 diabetes is characterised by increased fasting and postprandial plasma Î±-dicarbonyl stress, which can be reduced by improving glucose metabolism through a VLCD or RYGB. These data highlight the potential to reduce reactive Î±-dicarbonyls in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01167959.",10.1007/s00125-016-4009-1,,,,1462
574,Chronic Pain After Gastric Bypass: Another Argument to Support Mesenteric Windows Closure.,"Chronic pain is frequent after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Recurrent internal hernias (IHs) may be responsible for chronic abdominal pain. Physical examination and computed tomography are often inconclusive. This observational retrospective study describes 11 patients who underwent elective laparoscopy for post-RYGB chronic abdominal pain of undetermined etiology after noninvasive investigations and failure of conservative treatment. Open intermesenteric and/or Peterson spaces were found in all cases; IH was present in 6 cases. Nine patients were totally relieved from symptoms after mesenteric windows closure; substantial improvement was noted in the remaining 2 cases. Peterson space was found more likely to be responsible for chronic IH. In such selected patients, laparoscopic exploration and windows closure should be discussed. These findings add support to initial windows closure during RYGB.",10.1097/SLE.0000000000000737,,,,1463
861,Pharmacokinetics in Morbid Obesity: Influence of Two Bariatric Surgery Techniques on Paracetamol and Caffeine Metabolism.,"The purpose of the study was to study the impact of the two most common bariatric surgery techniques on paracetamol pharmacokinetics (a marker of gastric emptying) and caffeine metabolism (a marker of liver function). In the present prospective study, we studied 24 morbid obese patients before, at 4Â weeks, and 6Â months after having undergone sleeve gastrectomy (nÂ =Â 10) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (nÂ =Â 14). For comparative purposes, 28 healthy controls (14 normal weights and 14 overweights) were also included in the study. Paracetamol pharmacokinetics was altered in the obese participants leading to lower bioavailability. Bariatric surgery resulted in faster absorption and normalized pharmacokinetic parameters, prompting an increase in paracetamol bioavailability. No differences were found between surgical procedures. In the case of caffeine, the ratio paraxanthine/caffeine did not differ between morbid obese and healthy individuals. This ratio remained unmodified after surgery, indicating that the liver function (assessed by cytochrome P450 1A2 activity) was unaffected by obesity or bariatric surgery. Paracetamol pharmacokinetics and caffeine plasma levels are altered in severely obese patients. The two studied bariatric surgical techniques normalize paracetamol oral bioavailability without impairing the liver function (measured by cytochrome P450 1A2 activity).",10.1007/s11695-017-2745-z,,,,1464

961,Peptide YY and glucagon-like peptide-1 contribute to decreased food intake after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.,"Exaggerated postprandial secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) may explain appetite reduction and weight loss after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), but causality has not been established. We hypothesized that food intake decreases after surgery through combined actions from GLP-1 and PYY. GLP-1 actions can be blocked using the GLP-1 receptor antagonist Exendin 9-39 (Ex-9), whereas PYY actions can be inhibited by the administration of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor preventing the formation of PYY3-36. Appetite-regulating gut hormones and appetite ratings during a standard mixed-meal test and effects on subsequent ad libitum food intake were evaluated in two studies: in study 1, nine patients with type 2 diabetes were examined prospectively before and 3 months after RYGB with and without Ex-9. In study 2, 12 RYGB-operated patients were examined in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design on four experimental days with: (1) placebo, (2) Ex-9, (3) the DPP-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin, to reduce formation of PYY3-36 and (4) Ex-9/sitagliptin combined. In study 1, food intake decreased by 35% following RYGB compared with before surgery. Before surgery, GLP-1 receptor blockage increased food intake but no effect was seen postoperatively, whereas PYY secretion was markedly increased. In study 2, combined GLP-1 receptor blockage and DPP-4 inhibitor mediated lowering of PYY3-36 increased food intake by ~20% in RYGB patients, whereas neither GLP-1 receptor blockage nor DPP-4 inhibition alone affected food intake, perhaps because of concomitant marked increases in the unblocked hormone. Blockade of actions from only one of the two L-cell hormones, GLP-1 and PYY3-36, resulted in concomitant increased secretion of the other, probably explaining the absent effect on food intake on these experimental days. Combined blockade of GLP-1 and PYY actions increased food intake after RYGB, supporting that these hormones have a role in decreased food intake postoperatively.",10.1038/ijo.2016.121,,,,1466

230,Linear and circular stapled gastrojejunal anastomoses in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: stomal diameter at onset and at long-term follow-up.,"In the laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure, the gastrojejunal stoma is constructed with either a circular (CSD) or a linear stapling device (LSD). The diameter of the stoma following stapling with the 21â€‰mm CSD is expected to be approximately 12â€‰mm (diameter of the anvil). Measuring the stoma diameter after linear stapling is a little more complex since the remaining opening in the linear anastomosis is closed by hand. The aim of this prospective randomized study was to follow up on changes in the diameter of gastrojejunal stomata after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass using either a CSD or an LSD between that at construction and at a long-term follow-up of 12-72â€‰months later. Twenty patients were randomly assigned to gastrojejunostomy with either a 21â€‰mm CSD or a 45â€‰mm LSD. Directly after completion of the surgery, the diameter of the gastrojejunal stoma was measured using a Fogarty occlusion catheter and again at follow-up 12-72â€‰months later. Five patients were lost for follow-up, and 15 patients remained. The mean diameter of the CSD stomata at construction was 19.3â€‰Â±â€‰5.3â€‰mm (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SD) and increased to 26.4â€‰Â±â€‰6.6â€‰mm at follow-up after a mean of 46â€‰months (PÂ =Â 0.02). The corresponding figures for the LSD stomata were 26.2â€‰Â±â€‰4.1â€‰mm, increasing to 32.7â€‰Â±â€‰3.0â€‰mm also after a mean follow-up of 46â€‰months (PÂ =Â 0.03). The mean diameter of the circular stapled gastrojejunostomy stomata at construction was 20â€‰mm, that is, considerably larger than the 12â€‰mm expected. After a mean of 5â€‰years, the mean diameter had increased by 37%. The mean diameter of the linear stapled stomata increased by 25%.",10.1111/ans.17988,,,,1468
413,"Effects of Gastric Bypass Surgery on the Brain: Simultaneous Assessment of Glucose Uptake, Blood Flow, Neural Activity, and Cognitive Function During Normo- and Hypoglycemia.","While Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery in obese individuals typically improves glycemic control and prevents diabetes, it also frequently causes asymptomatic hypoglycemia. Previous work showed attenuated counterregulatory responses following RYGB. The underlying mechanisms as well as the clinical consequences are unclear. In this study, 11 subjects without diabetes with severe obesity were investigated pre- and post-RYGB during hyperinsulinemic normo-hypoglycemic clamps. Assessments were made of hormones, cognitive function, cerebral blood flow by arterial spin labeling, brain glucose metabolism by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography, and activation of brain networks by functional MRI. Post- versus presurgery, we found a general increase of cerebral blood flow but a decrease of total brain FDG uptake during normoglycemia. During hypoglycemia, there was a marked increase in total brain FDG uptake, and this was similar for post- and presurgery, whereas hypothalamic FDG uptake was reduced during hypoglycemia. During hypoglycemia, attenuated responses of counterregulatory hormones and improvements in cognitive function were seen postsurgery. In early hypoglycemia, there was increased activation post- versus presurgery of neural networks in brain regions implicated in glucose regulation, such as the thalamus and hypothalamus. The results suggest adaptive responses of the brain that contribute to lowering of glycemia following RYGB, and the underlying mechanisms should be further elucidated.",10.2337/db20-1172,,,,1469
762,Accuracy of total energy expenditure predictive equations after a massive weight loss induced by bariatric surgery.,"Predictive equations remain the clinical tool of choice to estimate the energy expenditure, however, poor accuracy has been found when applied in patients with severe obesity. The aim of this study was to test the accuracy of the total energy expenditure (TEE) those obtained by predictive equations of resting energy expenditure (REE) times individual estimates of metabolic equivalents (MET), taking as reference the TEE measured by doubly labeled water (DLW), before, six and twelve months after bariatric surgery. Twenty class III obese women (age: 29.4Â Â±Â 5.1 years; BMI: 44.9Â Â±Â 2.5Â kg/m2), approved for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass participated in this study. TEE and body composition was measured after administration of a fixed dose of DLW. Predictive equations of REE were selected: Dietary Reference Intake (DRI), World Health Organization, Oxford, Harris-Benedict, Mifflin, De Lorenzo, Lazzer and Muller and their collaborators. The MET values were obtained individually by triaxial accelerometer. The patients showed 65% of excess weight loss. The body fat mass decreased 17% after 1 year of surgery. TEE (2930Â Â±Â 525Â kcal.day-1) decreased by 20% (pÂ <Â 0.05) by the sixth postoperative month (2319Â Â±Â 430Â kcal.day-1), increasing 10% by the twelfth month (2538Â Â±Â 336Â kcal.day-1). The Harris and Benedict (accuracy: 65%) and DRI equations (accuracy: 60%) yielded better results in the prediction of TEE values at pre-surgery. In the sixth month after surgery, only the equation of Harris and Benedict kept accuracy above 50%. At twelve months post-surgery, only the equation of Lazzer etÂ al. considering body composition showed better prediction (accuracy: 50%) in this period. None of the prediction equations tested was accurate for estimating TEE for the 3 periods evaluated; however, while there are no reports of specific equations for class III obese women, the Harris and Benedict x MET and DRI equations, can describe the TEE with acceptable accuracy. After surgery, the best equation to be used will depend if the patient has been treated for weight loss and in which post-treatment period it is used.

42,"Adaptive thermogenesis, at the level of resting energy expenditure, after diet alone or diet plus bariatric surgery.","The objective of this study was to compare the magnitude of adaptive thermogenesis (AT), at the level of resting energy expenditure (REE), after a very low-energy diet alone or combined with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy, as well as to investigate the association between AT and changes in appetite. A total of 44 participants with severe obesity underwent 10â€‰weeks of a very low-energy diet alone or combined with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. Body weight and composition, REE, subjective appetite feelings, and plasma concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones were measured at baseline and week 11. AT, at the level of REE, was defined as a significantly lower measured versus predicted (using a regression model with baseline data) REE. Participants lost 18.4â€‰Â±â€‰3.9â€‰kg of body weight and experienced AT, at the level of REE (-121â€‰Â±â€‰188â€‰kcal/day; pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), with no differences among groups. The larger the AT, at the level of REE, the greater the reduction in fasting ghrelin concentrations and the smaller the reduction in feelings of hunger and desire to eat in the postprandial state. Weight-loss modality does not seem to modulate the magnitude of AT, at the level of REE. The greater the AT, at the level of REE, the greater the drive to eat following weight loss.",10.1002/oby.24031,,,,1471
1389,Predictors of survival in patients with malignant gastric outlet obstruction: a patient-oriented decision approach for palliative treatment.,"Gastrojejunostomy and stentplacement are the most commonly used treatments for malignant gastric outlet obstruction (GOO). The preference for either treatment largely depends on the expected survival. Our objective was to investigate predictors of survival in patients with malignant GOO and to develop a model that could aid in the decision for either gastrojejunostomy or stentplacement. Prognostic factors for survival were collected from a literature search and evaluated in our patient population, which included 95 retrospectively and 56 prospectively followed cases. All 151 patients were treated with gastrojejunostomy or stentplacement. A higher WHO performance score was the only significant prognostic factor for survival in our multivariable analysis (HR 2.2 95%CI 1.7-2.9), whereas treatment for obstructive jaundice, gender, age, metastases, weight loss, level of obstruction and pancreatic cancer were not. A prognostic model that includes the WHO score was able to distinguish patients with a poor survival (WHO score 3-4, median survival: 31 days) from those with a relatively intermediate or good survival (WHO score 2, median survival: 69 and WHO score 0-1, median survival: 139 days, respectively). Only the WHO score is a significant predictor of survival in patients with malignant GOO. A simple prognostic model is able to guide the palliative treatment decision for either gastrojejunostomy (WHO score 0-1) or stentplacement (WHO 3-4) in patients with malignant GOO.",10.1016/j.dld.2011.01.017,,,,1472
905,Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single doses of rivaroxaban in obese patients prior to and after bariatric surgery.,"Venous thromboembolism is an important cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality in bariatric surgery. Studies of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are not available in this surgical field. The objective of this phase 1 clinical trial was to investigate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters of rivaroxaban in bariatric patients. In this single-centre study, obese patients received single oral doses of rivaroxaban (10Â mg) 1Â day prior to and 3Â days after bariatric surgery. PK and PD parameters were assessed at baseline and during 24Â h after drug ingestion. Six Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients and six sleeve gastrectomy patients completed the study. Mean rivaroxaban area under plasma concentration-time curve, peak plasma concentration, time to peak plasma concentration and terminal half-life were 971.9Â Î¼gÂ·hÂ l-1 (coefficient of variation: 10.6), 135.3Â Î¼gÂ l-1 (26.7), 1.5Â h and 13.1Â h (34.1) prior to and 1165.8 (21.9), 170.0 (15.9), 1.5 and 8.9 (44.6) postsurgery for SG patients and 933.7Â Î¼gÂ·hÂ l-1 (22.3), 136.5Â Î¼gÂ l-1 (10.7), 1.5Â h und 13.8Â h (46.6) prior to and 1029.4 (7.4), 110.8 (31.8), 2.5 and 15 (60.0) postsurgery for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients, respectively. Prothrombin fragments (F1Â +Â 2) decreased during the first 12Â hours and increased thereafter in the pre- and the postbariatric setting. Thrombin-antithrombin complexes dropped within 1-3 h in the prebariatric setting and remained low after surgery until they increased at 24Â h postdose. Rivaroxaban was well tolerated and no relevant safety issues were observed. Bariatric surgery does not appear to alter PK of rivaroxaban in a clinically relevant way.

1546,Pain and wound healing in surgical patients.,"Human and animal laboratory studies have shown that stress delays healing of standardized punch biopsy wounds. This 5-week prospective study of 17 women who underwent elective gastric bypass surgery addressed the association between postsurgical pain intensity and subsequent healing of a standard 2.0-mm punch biopsy wound. Participants were assessed 1 week before surgery, within 3 hr before surgery, 1 to 3 days postsurgery, and at weekly intervals for 4 weeks following surgery. Patient ratings of greater acute postsurgical pain, averaged over Days 1 and 2 postsurgery, and greater persistent postsurgical pain, averaged over 4 weekly postsurgery pain ratings, were significantly associated with subsequent delayed healing of the punch biopsy wound. Presence of depressive symptoms on the day of surgery, pre-existing persistent pain, and medical complications following initial discharge from the hospital were not related to wound healing. Depressive symptoms on the day of surgery and pre-existing persistent pain did predict persistent postsurgical pain intensity. These findings extend the previous laboratory models of wound healing to a surgical population, providing the first evidence that pain plays an important role in postsurgery wound healing, a key variable in postsurgical recovery.",10.1207/s15324796abm3102_8,,,,1474
1370,Differential metabolic impact of gastric bypass surgery versus dietary intervention in obese diabetic subjects despite identical weight loss.,"Glycemic control is improved more after gastric bypass surgery (GBP) than after equivalent diet-induced weight loss in patients with morbid obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. We applied metabolomic profiling to understand the mechanisms of this better metabolic response after GBP. Circulating amino acids (AAs) and acylcarnitines (ACs) were measured in plasma from fasted subjects by targeted tandem mass spectrometry before and after a matched 10-kilogram weight loss induced by GBP or diet. Total AAs and branched-chain AAs (BCAAs) decreased after GBP, but not after dietary intervention. Metabolites derived from BCAA oxidation also decreased only after GBP. Principal components (PC) analysis identified two major PCs, one composed almost exclusively of ACs (PC1) and another with BCAAs and their metabolites as major contributors (PC2). PC1 and PC2 were inversely correlated with pro-insulin concentrations, the C-peptide response to oral glucose, and the insulin sensitivity index after weight loss, whereas PC2 was uniquely correlated with levels of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). These data suggest that the enhanced decrease in circulating AAs after GBP occurs by mechanisms other than weight loss and may contribute to the better improvement in glucose homeostasis observed with the surgical intervention.",10.1126/scitranslmed.3002043,,,,1475
1595,Bone and gastric bypass surgery: effects of dietary calcium and vitamin D.,"To examine bone mass and metabolism in women who had previously undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and determine the effect of supplementation with calcium (Ca) and vitamin D. Bone mineral density and bone mineral content (BMC) were examined in 44 RYGB women (> or = 3 years post-surgery; 31% weight loss; BMI, 34 kg/m(2)) and compared with age- and weight-matched control (CNT) women (n = 65). In a separate analysis, RYGB women who presented with low bone mass (n = 13) were supplemented to a total 1.2 g Ca/d and 8 microg vitamin D/d over 6 months and compared with an unsupplemented CNT group (n = 13). Bone mass and turnover and serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were measured. Bone mass did not differ between premenopausal RYGB and CNT women (42 +/- 5 years), whereas postmenopausal RYGB women (55 +/- 7 years) had higher bone mineral density and BMC at the lumbar spine and lower BMC at the femoral neck. Before and after dietary supplementation, bone mass was similar, and serum PTH and markers of bone resorption were higher (p < 0.001) in RYGB compared with CNT women and did not change significantly after supplementation. Postmenopausal RYGB women show evidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, elevated bone resorption, and patterns of bone loss (reduced femoral neck and higher lumbar spine) similar to other subjects with hyperparathyroidism. Although a modest increase in Ca or vitamin D does not suppress PTH or bone resorption, it is possible that greater dietary supplementation may be beneficial.",10.1038/oby.2004.7,,,,1476

Tubular or single tubular stents have limited efficacy due to the particular anatomy. To assess the feasibility of a Y-shaped, fully-coated, self-expandable, metallic stent (SEMS) for anastomotic stenosis after gastrojejunostomy (Billroth II). Between January 2008 and August 2014, 14 patients (10 with gastric carcinoma and four with duodenal ulcers) had anastomotic stenoses following Billroth II reconstructions. Eight patients with gastric cancer had tumor recurrence near the anastomosis; two had benign strictures. The four duodenal ulcer patients had benign stenoses. An integrated Y-shaped, fully coated SEMS was designed to accord with the anatomy of residual gastrojejunal anastomotic strictures. Fourteen stents were inserted under fluoroscopic control. Follow-up was at 1, 3, 9, and 12 months, and then annually. All 14 stents were inserted successfully at the first attempt with a technical success rate of 100%. After stenting, abdominal symptoms resolved in all patients. All patients were followed up for 4-27 months (mean, 13.9 months). One of the eight recurrent cases died of multiple tumor metastases and liver failure after 7 months, without obstruction symptoms. In all six patients with benign anastomotic stenosis, the stents were removed successfully without complication and with no evidence of restenosis based on clinical evaluation and imaging. A Y-shaped, fully-coated SEMS proved to be a feasible and minimally invasive procedure for treating anastomotic stenosis after gastrojejunostomy (Billroth II).",10.1177/0284185116633909,,,,1477
781,Relationship between intraoperative non-technical performance and technical events in bariatric surgery.,"The operating theatre is a unique environment with complex team interactions, where technical and non-technical performance affect patient outcomes. The correlation between technical and non-technical performance, however, remains underinvestigated. The purpose of this study was to explore these interactions in the operating theatre. A prospective single-centre observational study was conducted at a tertiary academic medical centre. One surgeon and three fellows participated as main operators. All patients who underwent a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and had the procedures captured using the Operating Room Black BoxÂ® platform were included. Technical assessment was performed using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills and Generic Error Rating Tool instruments. For non-technical assessment, the Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) and Scrub Practitioners' List of Intraoperative Non-Technical Skills (SPLINTS) tools were used. Spearman rank-order correlation and N-gram statistics were conducted. Fifty-six patients were included in the study and 90 procedural steps (gastrojejunostomy and jejunojejunostomy) were analysed. There was a moderate to strong correlation between technical adverse events (rs â€‰=â€‰0Â·417-0Â·687), rectifications (rs â€‰=â€‰0Â·380-0Â·768) and non-technical performance of the surgical and nursing teams (NOTSS and SPLINTS). N-gram statistics showed that after technical errors, events and prior rectifications, the staff surgeon and the scrub nurse exhibited the most positive non-technical behaviours, irrespective of operator (staff surgeon or fellow). This study demonstrated that technical and non-technical performances are related, on both an individual and a team level. Valuable data can be obtained around intraoperative errors, events and rectifications.",10.1002/bjs.10811,,,,1478

University hospital. Between May 1999 and June 2000, 70 patients were randomly assigned to laparoscopic (n = 36) or open (n = 34) GBP. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis consisted of antiembolism stockings and sequential pneumatic compression devices. Plasminogen, thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), prothrombin fragment 1.2 (F1.2), fibrinogen, D-dimer, antithrombin III (AT), and protein C levels were measured at baseline and at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively. A venous duplex examination of both lower extremities was performed preoperatively and between the third and fifth day postoperatively. The 2 groups were similar in age, weight, and body mass index. Plasminogen levels decreased, and TAT, F1.2, and fibrinogen levels increased after laparoscopic and open GBP. There was no significant difference in these levels between groups. D-dimer levels increased in both groups, but the levels were significantly higher after open GBP than after laparoscopic GBP (P<.01). Antithrombin III and protein C levels decreased in both groups. The reduction of AT (at 1 hour) and protein C (at 72 hours) was significantly less after laparoscopic GBP than after open GBP (P<.05). Postoperative venous duplex examination revealed DVT in 1 (2.9%) of 34 patients after open GBP but in none of 36 patients after laparoscopic GBP. One patient developed pulmonary embolism after open GBP. Laparoscopic GBP induces a hypercoagulable state similar to that of open GBP. Our findings suggest that DVT prophylaxis should be used during laparoscopic GBP as in open GBP.",10.1001/archsurg.136.8.909,,,,1479
986,"Fecal Calprotectin, Elastase, and Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Levels After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass; Calprotectin Is Significantly Elevated in the Majority of Patients.","Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) causes several alterations in gastrointestinal function. We hypothesized that levels of three commonly used fecal tests change after RYGB. Fecal levels of calprotectin, elastase, and alpha-1-antitrypsin were determined in 122 patients without signs of gastrointestinal disease 1 to 2Â years after RYGB. Medians, distribution of values, and the percentage of patients with levels above or below reference values were determined. Median fecal calprotectin level was 163.5 (<30-1587) Î¼g/g; in 87Â % of patients, it was above the reference value (<50Â Î¼g/g). Median fecal elastase level was 444 (<15-647) Î¼g/g; 13Â % was below the reference value (>200Â Î¼g/g). Median fecal alpha-1-antitrypsin level was 0.51 (<0.20-2.20) mg/g, comparable to the reference values. Fecal calprotectin levels are significantly higher than the reference value in most patients after RYGB. Fecal elastase is significantly lower. This might indicate that the validity of fecal calprotectin testing is impaired after RYGB and the specificity for fecal elastase is decreased. Clinical awareness of altered fecal markers after RYGB is essential to prevent unnecessary diagnostic tests, such as colonoscopy.

1024,Equivalent Increases in Circulating GLP-1 Following Jejunal Delivery of Intact and Hydrolysed Casein: Relevance to Satiety Induction Following Bariatric Surgery.,"Both Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) decrease the latency of food delivery to the proximal small intestine. This is implicated in exaggerated post-prandial release of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which provokes early satiety and reductions in food intake. Altered stomach anatomy also creates a deficit in enzymatic pre-processing. The impact of this state effect as a modulator of gut hormone responses remains underexplored. A double-blind cross-over trial study was conducted in 13 healthy subjects assigned to receive in the fasted state and in random order at 1Â week apart, a direct jejunal infusion of either intact casein or a casein hydrolysate. Downstream effects on GLP-1 release, ratings of hunger and fullness and food and water intake on each study day were recorded when an ad libitum meal was provided 30Â min after the infusion. Circulating GLP-1 was increased 25Â min after infusions and peaked to a similar degree at 15Â min post-meal initiation. The hormone surge had no impact on ratings of hunger and fullness ahead of the ad libitum meal. The kinetic and magnitude of satiation following each infusion was not significantly different. Food and water intake were likewise not differentially impacted by the two infusion types. Protein macronutrient state upon arrival in the small intestine does not in isolation impact upon GLP-1 responses and subsequent onset of satiety. This potentially points to rate of delivery being the dominant factor in exaggerated post-prandial GLP-1 responses in patients post-RYGB and VSG.",10.1007/s11695-015-2005-z,,,,1481
1099,Roux-en-Y gastric bypass alleviates hypertension and is associated with an increase in mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide in morbid obese patients.,"To examine 24-h blood pressure (24BP), systemic haemodynamics and the effect of sodium intake on 24BP in obese patients before and after gastric bypass surgery [laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB)], and to determine whether weight loss from LRYGB might be related to an increase in plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide. Twelve hypertensive and 12 normotensive morbidly obese patients underwent LRYGB: 24BP, systemic haemodynamics and mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MRproANP) were assessed before, 6 weeks and 12 months after surgery. The effect of high versus low sodium intake on 24BP was evaluated before and 12 months after LRYGB. Six weeks after LRYGB, the average weight loss was 20â€Škg, with a further 21â€Škg weight loss 1 year after surgery. In hypertensive patients, 24BP was significantly reduced at 6 weeks, but not 1 year after LRYGB. However, antihypertensive medications were successively reduced from baseline to 1 year after surgery. In normotensive patients, there was no change in 24BP 6 weeks after LRYGB, but a tendency towards a reduction 1 year after the operation. Plasma concentrations of MRproANP were subnormal prior to surgery in hypertensive patients and increased by 77% 1 year after the operation. In normotensive patients, preoperative concentrations were normal and increased only by 6%. High sodium intake induced plasma volume expansion, increased stroke volume and cardiac output, but no significant change in 24BP - neither before nor after LRYGB. LRYGB resulted in a significant 24BP reduction and a substantial increase in MRproANP plasma concentrations in hypertensive, obese patients 6 weeks after surgery, suggesting a causal link between obesity-hypertension and altered release/degradation of cardiac natriuretic peptides.",10.1097/HJH.0000000000000526,,,,1482
1647,Estimation of the cost savings resulting from the use of ursodiol for the prevention of gallstones in obese patients undergoing rapid weight reduction.,"Morbidly obese patients enrolled in a rapid weight reduction program are at a high risk of developing gallstones. Two multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trials have demonstrated that the prophylactic use of ursodiol in males and females 18 to 70 years of age is effective for the prevention of gallstone formation in this patient population. This study examines the cost consequences associated with the prophylactic use of ursodiol. A medical decision analysis model for the prophylactic administration of ursodiol in morbidly obese patients undergoing rapid weight reduction by either gastric bypass surgery or very-low-calorie-diet, was developed through the use of data from two clinical trials and review of the related literature. The expert opinion of clinicians from the fields of internal medicine, gastroenterology and surgery were solicited. Financial data for the charges associated with cholecystectomies, physician fees and ursodiol were obtained from current financial databases. The model demonstrates that the prophylactic administration of ursodiol, in morbidly obese patients undergoing rapid weight reduction, results in cost savings. Sensitivity analysis was performed to illustrate that the cost savings achieved by the prophylactic use of ursodiol were valid over a realistic range of charges and assumptions. The decision model may allow health care decision makers to apply their own data to the model to determine the cost savings obtainable through the prophylactic use of ursodiol in patients undergoing rapid weight reduction.",10.1038/sj.ijo.0800513,,,,1483
1237,Increase in the mediators of asthma in obesity and obesity with type 2 diabetes: reduction with weight loss.,"To determine whether the expression of key asthma related genes, IL-4, LIGHT, LTBR, MMP-9, CCR-2, and ADAM-33 in mononuclear cells and the plasma concentration of nitric oxide metabolites (NOM) and MMP-9 are increased in the obese, obese type 2 diabetics (T2DM) and in morbidly obese patients prior to and after gastric bypass surgery (RYGB). The expression of these genes in MNC and plasma concentrations of these indices was measured in healthy lean and in obese with and without T2DM and following RYGB in obese T2DM. The expression of IL-4, MMP-9, LIGHT and CCR-2 and plasma NOM concentrations was significantly higher in the obese subjects and in obese T2DM patients than in normal subjects. The expression of IL-4, LIGHT, MMP-9, and CCR-2 expression was related to BMI and HOMA-IR. The expression of IL-4, LIGHT, LTBR, ADAM-33, MMP-9, and CCR-2 fell after RYGB surgery as did plasma concentrations of MMP-9 and NOM. Obesity with and without T2DM is associated with an increase in the expression of IL-4, LIGHT, MMP-9 and CCR-2; plasma NOM and MMP-9 concentrations are also increased. Following RYGB surgery and weight loss, the expression of these factors in MNC and plasma concentrations falls significantly.",10.1002/oby.20524,,,,1484
807,Vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of vitamin D deficiency after bariatric surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of postoperative vitamin D deficiency. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane library were searched. Prospective studies evaluating the effects of vitamin D supplementation in patients who had undergone bariatric surgery were included. Meta-regression was performed to explore heterogeneity, and assess the relationship between dosage of vitamin D supplementation, study design, and prevalence of vitamin D depletion. Twelve studies enrolling 1285 patients met the inclusion criteria, and were included. Vitamin D supplementation was associated with significant improvements in 1-year Vitamin D depletion and 1-year 25-OHD level. A daily supplement of more than 800â€‰IU vitamin D significantly reduced the prevalence of 1-year Vitamin D depletion, but the dosage of less than 800â€‰IU did not. Significant decrease in prevalence of 1-year Vitamin D depletion was observed in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but not in non-RCTs. For the 1-year 25-OHD level, significant elevation was found in the studies irrespective of the study design and dosage of vitamin D supplementation. Meta-regression showed that there was significant relationship between vitamin D depletion and study design, but not between vitamin D depletion and the dosage of vitamin D supplementation. Vitamin D supplementation with a daily dosage of more than 800â€‰IU is effective in preventing postoperative vitamin D deficiency and improving the 25-OHD level. However, the results should be interpreted cautiously since there was significant heterogeneity among the studies.",10.1038/s41430-017-0059-9,,,,1485
1368,Xenon anesthesia reduces TNFÎ± and IL10 in bariatric patients.,"Anesthesia is able to modulate the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production during surgery. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of three anesthesia approaches, total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), inhalation anesthesia, and xenon anesthesia, on sieric levels of nitric oxide (NO), IL6, IL10, and TNFÎ± in obese patients undergoing Roux-en-Y laparoscopic gastric bypass. Thirty adult morbidly obese patients (BMIâ€‰>â€‰35) scheduled for Roux-en-Y laparoscopic gastric bypass were randomly recruited and allocated to TIVA (Nâ€‰=â€‰10), inhalation anesthesia (SEV, Nâ€‰=â€‰10), and xenon anesthesia (XE, Nâ€‰=â€‰10). Exclusion criteria were ASA IV, age <18 or >60Â years, and Mallampati IV. Opioid dosage and ventilation parameters were standardized. Sieric levels of NO, IL6, IL10, and TNFÎ± were assessed at T0 (before induction of anesthesia), T1 (end of surgery), and T2 (12Â h after the end of surgery). We compared the relative cytokine level variations (delta) at T1 and T2 and the cytokine exposure levels calculated as the area under the curve (AUC) between T0 and T2 in the XE and non-XE (SEVâ€‰+â€‰TIVA) groups. At T1, we found a significant Î”IL10 (reduction) and Î”TNFÎ± (reduction) between XE and SEV (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) and XE and TIVA (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) groups. At T2, Î”IL10 was still significant. Furthermore, we found a reduced AUC value for TNFÎ± in the XE group. Xenon anesthesia seems able to inhibit postoperative proinflammatory cytokine imbalance in morbidly obese patients undergoing Roux-en-Y laparoscopic gastric bypass; the reduced Î”TNFÎ± at T1 and the reduced global exposition to TNFÎ± in the XE group may explain the reduced Î”IL10 at T1 and T2.",10.1007/s11695-011-0433-y,,,,1486
300,The Diagnostic Accuracy of Abdominal Computed Tomography in Diagnosing Internal Herniation Following Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"To analyze the diagnostic accuracy of abdominal computed tomography (CT) in diagnosing internal herniation (IH) following Rouxen-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. IH is one of the most important and challenging complications following RYGB. Therefore, early and adequate diagnosis of IH is necessary. Currently, exploratory surgery is considered the gold standard in diagnosing IH. Although CT scans are frequently being used, the true diagnostic accuracy in diagnosing IH remains unclear. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were systematically searched for relevant articles describing the diagnostic accuracy of abdominal CT in diagnosing IH after RYGB. Data were extracted, recalculated, and pooled to report on the overall diagnostic accuracy of CT in diagnosing IH, and the diagnostic accuracy of specific radiological signs. A total of 20 studies describing 1637 patients were included. seventeen studies provided data regarding the overall diagnostic accuracy: pooled sensitivity of 82.0%, specificity of 84.8%, positive predictive value of 82.7%, and negative predictive value of 85.8% were calculated. Eleven studies reported on specific CT signs and their diagnostic accuracy. The radiological signs with the highest sensitivity were the signs of venous congestion, swirl, and mesenteric oedema (sensitivity of 78.7%, 77.8%, and 67.2%, respectively). This meta-analysis demonstrates that CT is a reliable imaging modality for the detection of IH. Therefore, abdominal CT imaging should be added to the diagnostic work-up for RYGB patients who present themselves with abdominal pain suggestive of IH to improve patient selection for explorative surgery.",10.1097/SLA.0000000000005247,,,,1487
677,Augmented GLP-1 Secretion as Seen After Gastric Bypass May Be Obtained by Delaying Carbohydrate Digestion.,"Exaggerated postprandial glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion seems important for weight loss and diabetes remission after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and may result from carbohydrate absorption in the distal small intestine. To investigate distal [GLP-1; peptide YY (PYY)] and proximal [glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)] gut hormone secretion in response to carbohydrates hydrolyzed at different rates. We hypothesized that slow digestion restricts proximal absorption, facilitating distal delivery of carbohydrates and thereby enhanced GLP-1 secretion in unoperated individuals, whereas this may not apply after RYGB. Single-blinded, randomized, crossover study. Hvidovre Hospital, Hvidovre, Denmark. Ten RYGB-operated patients and 10 unoperated matched subjects. Four separate days with ingestion of different carbohydrate loads, either rapidly/proximally digested (glucose plus fructose; sucrose) or slowly/distally digested (isomaltulose; sucrose plus acarbose). GLP-1 secretion (area under the curve above baseline). Secondary outcomes included PYY and GIP. Isomaltulose enhanced secretion of GLP-1 nearly threefold (P = 0.02) and PYY ninefold (P = 0.08) compared with sucrose in unoperated subjects but had a modest effect after RYGB. Acarbose failed to increase sucrose induced GLP-1 secretion in unoperated subjects and diminished the responses by 50% after RYGB (P = 0.03). In both groups, GIP secretion was reduced by isomaltulose and even more so by sucrose plus acarbose when compared with sucrose intake. GLP-1 secretion depends on the rate of carbohydrate digestion, but in a different manner after RYGB. Enhanced GLP-1 secretion is central after RYGB, but it may also be obtained in unoperated individuals by delaying hydrolysis of carbohydrates, pushing their digestion and absorption distally in the small intestine.",10.1210/jc.2018-02661,,,,1488
1651,Combined immunopharmaceutical therapy of patients with unresectable pancreatic carcinoma.,"This paper presents the results of a prospective randomized study of targeting locoregional chemotherapy and targeting locoregional immunostimulation therapy implemented in 36, out of 66, patients with a histological diagnosis of pancreatic duct carcinoma seen by our group from 1991 to Sept. 1994. Sixty-six patients with unresectable pancreatic duct carcinoma were separated into two groups. The first group received laparotomy (n = 30), with palliative gastric bypass (n = 8) or with palliative biliary bypass (n = 18). The second group received laparotomy (n = 36), with palliative gastric bypass (n = 9) or with palliative biliary bypass (n = 20), supplemented with locoregional immunostimulation and locoregional chemotherapy. This therapy consisted of ten days of infusion with Proleukin (IL2) and Imukin (gamma-IFN), emulsified in Lipidiol-Urographin. This infusion was performed five days trans-splenically and five days trans-tumorally. Fifteen days later, targeting locoregional chemotherapy was administered, again emulsified in Lipidiol-Urographin. All the patients in the first group are dead, with a mean survival of 4.5 months, as of November 1995. Presently, 47% (n = 17) of the second group have achieved a positive objective response, with a mean survival of 14.1 months. During re-exploration, eight patients became tumor free after pancreatic resection, which became feasible after our therapy and six are alive and have remained tumor free to date. Targeting locoregional immunotherapy, combined with locoregional chemotherapy appears to be a promising therapy, meriting further consideration for clinical application in patients with unresectable pancreatic ductal carcinoma.",,,,,1489
349,Iron Deficiency and Anemia 10 Years After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass for Severe Obesity.,"Iron deficiency with or without anemia is a well-known long-term complication after Roux-en-Y, gastric bypass (RYGB) as the procedure alters the gastrointestinal absorption of iron. Iron is essential for hemoglobin synthesis and a number of cellular processes in muscles, neurons, and other organs. Ferritin is the best marker of iron status, and in a patient without inflammation, iron deficiency occurs when ferritin levels are below 15 Âµg/L, while iron insufficiency occurs when ferritin levels are below 50 Âµg/L. Lifelong regular blood tests are recommended after RYGB, but the clinical relevance of iron deficiency and iron insufficiency might be misjudged as long as the hemoglobin levels are normal. The aim of this study was to explore the frequency of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia one decade or more after RYGB, the use of per oral iron supplements, and the frequency of intravenous iron treatment. Nine hundred and thirty patients who underwent RYGB for severe obesity at three public hospitals in Norway in the period 2003-2009 were invited to a follow-up visit 10-15 years later. Results from blood tests and survey data on the use of oral iron supplements and intravenous iron treatment were analyzed. Ferritin and hemoglobin levels more than 10 years after RYGB were available on 530 patients [423 (79.8%) women]. Median (IQR) ferritin was 33 (16-63) Âµg/L, and mean (SD) hemoglobin was 13.4 (1.3) g/dl. Iron deficiency (ferritin â‰¤ 15 Âµg/L) was seen in 125 (23.6%) patients; in addition, iron insufficiency (ferritin 16-50 Âµg/L) occurred in 233 (44%) patients. Mean (SD) hemoglobin levels were 12.5 (1.4) g/dl in patients with iron deficiency, 13.5 (1.2) g/dl in patients with iron insufficiency, 13.8 (1.3) g/dl in the 111 (21%) patients with ferritin 51-100 Âµg/L, and 13.8 (1.2) g/dl in the 55 (10%) patients with ferritin >100 Âµg/L. Two hundred and seventy-five (56%) patients reported taking oral iron supplements, and 138 (27.5%) had received intravenous iron treatment after the RYGB procedure. Iron deficiency or iron insufficiency occurred in two-thirds of the patients 10 years after RYGB, although more than half of them reported taking oral iron supplements.",10.3389/fendo.2021.679066,,,,1490
1605,Comparison of postoperative hepatic function after laparoscopic versus open gastric bypass.,"Pneumoperitoneum has been shown to reduce hepatic portal blood flow and alter postoperative hepatic transaminases. This study evaluated the changes in hepatic function after laparoscopic and open gastric bypass (GBP). Thirty-six morbidly obese patients were randomly assigned to undergo either laparoscopic (n = 18) or open (n = 18) GBP. Liver function tests--total bilirubin (T Bil), gamma GT (GGT), albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate transferase (AST), alanine transferase (ALT)--and creatine kinase levels were obtained preoperatively and at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively. The two groups were similar in age, sex, and body mass index. Albumin and ALP levels decreased while T Bil and GGT levels remained unchanged from baseline in both groups without significant difference between the two groups. After laparoscopic GBP, ALT and AST transiently increased by sixfold and returned to near baseline levels at 72 hours. After open GBP, ALT and AST transiently increased by fivefold to eightfold and returned to near baseline levels by 72 hours. Creatine kinase level was significantly lower after laparoscopic GBP than after open GBP at 48 and 72 hours postoperatively. There was no postoperative liver failure or mortality in either group. Laparoscopic GBP resulted in transient postoperative elevation of hepatic transaminase (ALT, AST) but did not adversely alter hepatic function to any greater extent than open GBP. Creatine kinase levels were lower after laparoscopic GBP reflecting its lesser degree of abdominal wall trauma.",10.1016/s0002-9610(03)00106-5,,,,1491

1396,Effects of inspiratory muscle training on muscular and pulmonary function after bariatric surgery in obese patients.,"This study seeks to assess the effect of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, and endurance in morbidly obese patients submitted to bariatric surgery. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to sham muscular training, or to IMT with a threshold device (40% of maximum inspiratory pressure, MIP), for 30 min/day, from the 2nd until 30th postoperative (PO) day. All of them were submitted to a standard respiratory kinesiotherapy and early deambulation protocol. Data on spirometry, maximum static respiratory pressures, and respiratory muscle endurance were collected on the PO days 2, 7, 14, and 30 in a blinded matter. IMT enabled increases in PO MIP and endurance, and an earlier recovery of the spirometry parameters FEV(1), PEF, and FEF(25-75%). Comparing to preoperative values, MIP was increased by 13% at the 30th PO day in the trained group, whereas control group had a reduction of 8%, with higher values for the IMT group (30th PO, IMT-130.6â€‰Â±â€‰22.9 cmH(2)O; controls-112.9â€‰Â±â€‰25.1 cmH(2)O; pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Muscular endurance at the 30th PO day was increased in the trained group comparing to preoperative value (61.5â€‰Â±â€‰39.6 s vs 114.9â€‰Â±â€‰55.2 s; pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), a finding not observed in the control group (81.7â€‰Â±â€‰44.3 vs 95.2â€‰Â±â€‰42.0 s). IMT improves inspiratory muscle strength and endurance and accounts for an earlier recovery of pulmonary airflows in morbidly obese patients submitted to bariatric surgery.",10.1007/s11695-010-0349-y,,,,1493
1302,"Evaluation of the influence of whole and defatted flaxseed on satiety, glucose, and leptin levels of women in the late postoperative stage of bariatric surgery.","Satiety decline is one of the factors that are involved in weight regain in the postoperative period of bariatric surgery. Nutrients such as long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid and fibers could assist in food intake control by increasing satiety. Flaxseed is a source of these nutrients, and its consumption could help with possible glycemic control and increased satiety. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of whole flaxseed and defatted flaxseed on satiety, postprandial blood glucose, and leptin in post-bariatric women. A single-blind crossover and randomized study was performed with 18 women in the late postoperative of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP). All women received three test meals containing whole flaxseed, defatted flaxseed, and placebo with 1Â week of washout. Satiety was evaluated by a Visual Analog Scale during the fasting period; immediately after ingestion; and 60, 120, and 180Â min after meals. There was no difference between test meals for the variables of hunger, satisfaction, fullness, and desire to eat. The basal and postprandial glucose and leptin levels did not differ between the test meals. The intake of defatted flaxseed and placebo muffins resulted in reduced postprandial blood glucose. Postprandial leptin was higher than the baseline (pâ€‰=â€‰0.02); however, only defatted flaxseed showed increased postprandial leptin levels (pâ€‰=â€‰0.044). Whole flaxseed and defatted flaxseed did not promote satiety in women in the late postoperative of RYGBP. However, the test meals with a lower fat content increased the serum leptin levels.",10.1007/s11695-012-0733-x,,,,1494
1659,Gastrointestinal hormone responses to meals before and after gastric bypass and vertical banded gastroplasty.,"The purpose of the study was to examine the gastrointestinal hormone responses to meals in morbidly obese patients before and after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GBP; n = 9) or vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG; n = 7). On consecutive days before and after operation, we measured changes in peripheral blood levels of glucose, insulin, enteroglucagon, serotonin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and cholecystokinin (CCK) in response to a standardized glucose or protein-fat meal. The percentage of excess weight lost at 6 months after operation was 66.3% +/- 4% and 41.8% +/- 5% for GBP and VBG, respectively (p less than 0.01). The 3-hour integrated glucose response to a glucose meal decreased from 145.3 +/- 33.7 to 75.8 +/- 15.7 g min/L (p less than 0.02) after GBP. This was associated with a decrease in 3-hour integrated insulin response from 22.8 +/- 8.2 to 10.5 +/- 4.9 mU min/L. Vertical banded gastroplasty patients had lesser reductions of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Neither the CCK, serotonin, nor VIP responses to meals were altered by either operation. The 3-hour integrated enteroglucagon response to glucose increased markedly in GBP patients after operation from 11.8 +/- 6 to 133.4 +/- 38 nmol min/mL (p less than 0.02). This increase in enteroglucagon occurred at the same time as development of dumping symptoms, which occurred exclusively in GBP patients after glucose but not protein. We conclude that (1) GBP surgery for morbid obesity results in amelioration of glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia, (2) CCK does not mediate an endocrine satiety effect of surgery, (3) GBP is associated with an exaggerated enteroglucagon response to glucose, and (4) enteroglucagon appears to be a marker of the dumping syndrome in GBP patients.",10.1097/00000658-199006000-00016,,,,1495
323,Endoscopic duodenal stent placement versus gastrojejunostomy for unresectable pancreatic cancer patients with duodenal stenosis before introduction of initial chemotherapy (GASPACHO study): a multicenter retrospective study.,"Endoscopic duodenal stent placement is an alternative technique to gastrojejunostomy for gastric outlet obstruction due to pancreatic cancer. We compared the efficacy of endoscopic duodenal stent placement with that of gastrojejunostomy for treating patients with pancreatic cancer who are candidates for intensive combination chemotherapies as the first line of treatment. This retrospective observational study included 100 patients from 18 institutions in Japan. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) cytologically or histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, (2) good performance status, (3) gastric outlet obstruction scoring system score of 0-1 and (4) no history of treatment for pancreatic cancer. There was no significant difference in the background characteristics of patients in the endoscopic duodenal stent placement (nÂ =Â 57) and gastrojejunostomy (nÂ =Â 43) groups. The median overall survival in the endoscopic duodenal stent placement and gastrojejunostomy groups was 5.9 and 6.0Â months, respectively. Clinical success was achieved in 93 cases; the median time to food intake resumption was significantly shorter in the endoscopic duodenal stent placement group (median: 3Â days, nÂ =Â 54) than in the gastrojejunostomy group (median: 5Â days, nÂ =Â 43). Chemotherapy was introduced in 63% of the patients in both groups after endoscopic duodenal stent placement or gastrojejunostomy. Chemotherapy was started earlier in the endoscopic duodenal stent placement group (median: 14Â days) than in the gastrojejunostomy (median: 32Â days) group. Endoscopic duodenal stent placement showed similar or better clinical outcomes than gastrojejunostomy. Thus, it might be a promising option in patients with good performance status.",10.1093/jjco/hyab194,,,,1496

1269,Anatomical basis for the low incidence of internal hernia after a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass without mesenteric closure.,"Different techniques have been designed to reduce the rate of internal hernia (IH) after laparoscopic bariatric surgery, and mesenteric closure is possibly the most controversial. We propose a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) procedure without mesenteric closure with several specific technical details to avoid IH. To support this view, we have reviewed the outcome of our LRYGB patients and have carried out an anatomical study on cadavers. A retrospective observational study was carried out using the Unit's prospective database. The patients selected were those who were operated on for morbid obesity using LRYGB and who presented to the Emergency Unit with symptoms of intestinal obstruction (IO). Data concerning demographics, weight progress, technical details of the surgery, follow-up percentage, morbidity, and mortality were collected. Furthermore, an anatomical model was made in order to recreate the surgery on cadavers. Only 1.6Â % of postoperative IO and very few (0.3Â %) of IH cases were associated with our technique of LRYGB without mesenteric closure. The anatomical model showed two large potential hernia spaces, but their supramesocolic situation, the orientation of the bowel loops, leaving the mesentery and omentum undivided and the antecolic passage of the alimentary limb made intestinal herniation difficult even though the mesenteric spaces were not closed. With a proper technique, the closure of mesenteric spaces after a LRYGB is not essential to avoid postoperative IH in bariatric patients, as evidenced in an anatomical model.",10.1007/s11695-013-0902-6,,,,1498
835,Adipocyte Size and Leptin Receptor Expression in Human Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.,"The molecular mechanisms implicated in pronounced weight loss and metabolic benefits after bariatric surgery are still unknown. Adipocyte phenotype and metabolism have not been entirely explored. However, some features of adipocyte function have been studied, such as adipocyte size and inflammation, which are both reduced after bariatric surgery. Adipocyte fat metabolism, which is partly regulated by leptin, is likely modified, since adipocyte area is decreased. Here, we show that leptin receptor expression is increased, while adipocyte size is decreased 8Â months after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Thus, adipocyte function is possibly modified by improved leptin signaling after bariatric surgery.",10.1007/s11695-017-2930-0,,,,1499
1285,The impact assessment of weight loss on an aggressive behavior and satisfaction with the connubial or cohabitation relationship in patients after Roux-en-Y gastric-by-pass surgery performed laparoscopically.,"was an assesment the impact of weight loss in patients undergoing gastric by-pass surgery on an aggressive behavior affecting the satisfaction with the connubial or cohabitation relationship The study included a total number of 100 people (50 people with morbid obesity underwent gastric-bypass surgery and their male or female partners). The study was conducted by using two questionnaires: the Psychological Inventory of Aggression Syndrome-1 authorship by Z.B. GaÅ› as well as Extinguishes and the Chosen Marriage Questionnaire-2 developed by M. Plop and J. Rostowski The analysis of the results showed the influence of the weight loss on the aggressive behaviour at the examined group. Important differences were shown in the first phase of the examination among the examined group and the control group on scales: emotional self-aggression, the hostility towards surroundings and directed outside aggression. Regression analysis showed a statistical relationship between outward aggression and disappointment, 0.346 p<0.01, intimacy 0.943 p<0.01, and the result of general satisfaction with the relationship 0.832 p<0.05.While self-realization is negatively correlated with a displaced aggression -0.342 p<0.01 and the intermediate one -0.225 p<0.01. Hostility towards the environment correlates positively with intimacy 0.326 p<0.01. Indirect aggression correlates negatively with a disappointment -0.324 for p <0.05. Important differences were shown in the second stage of the examination among groups examined on the scale inspection of the aggressive behaviour. Substantial results weren't demonstrated on scales: emotional self-aggression, hostility towards the environment and directed outside aggression In the regression analysis we received a statistically significant result: controlling an aggressive behavior correlates negatively with disappointment -0, 355 p <0,01. However, no statistically significant results were received from the partners of obese people. Weight loss after gastric-by-pass surgery has the significant impact on the rarer occurrence of an aggressive behavior, which improving the quality of the connubial or cohabitation relationship.",10.2478/v10035-012-0073-5,,,,1500
646,Effects of GLP-1 on counter-regulatory responses during hypoglycemia after GBP surgery.,"The aim of the study was to explore the role of GLP-1 receptor activation on the counter-regulation and symptoms of hypoglycemia in subjects who have undergone gastric bypass surgery (GBP). Experimental hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp study. Twelve post-GBP subjects participated in a randomized cross-over study with two hyperinsulinemic, hypoglycemic clamps (glucose nadir 2.7 mmol/L) performed on separate days with concomitant infusions of the GLP-1 analog exenatide or with saline, respectively. Continuous measurements of metabolites and counter-regulatory hormones as well as assessments of heart rate variability and symptoms of hypoglycemia were performed throughout the clamps. No effect of GLP-1 receptor activation on counter-regulatory hormones (glucagon, catecholamines, cortisol, GH) or glucose infusion rate was seen, but we found indications of a downregulation of the sympathetic relative to the parasympathetic nerve activity, as reflected in heart rate variability. No significant differences in symptom of hypoglycemia were observed. Short-term exposure to a GLP-1 receptor agonist does not seem to impact the counter-regulatory hormonal and metabolic responses in post-GBP subjects during hypoglycemic conditions, suggesting that the improvement in symptomatic hypoglycemia post-GBP seen following treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists may be mediated by mechanism not directly involved in counter-regulation.",10.1530/EJE-19-0171,,,,1501
978,Metabolic responses to xenin-25 are altered in humans with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.,"Xenin-25 (Xen) is a neurotensin-related peptide secreted by a subset of enteroendocrine cells located in the proximal small intestine. Many effects of Xen are mediated by neurotensin receptor-1 on neurons. In healthy humans with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), Xen administration causes diarrhea and inhibits postprandial glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) release but not insulin secretion. This study determines (i) if Xen has similar effects in humans with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and (ii) whether neural pathways potentially mediate effects of Xen on glucose homeostasis. Eight females with RYGB and no history of type 2 diabetes received infusions with 0, 4 or 12pmol Xen/kg/min with liquid meals on separate occasions. Plasma glucose and gastrointestinal hormone levels were measured and insulin secretion rates calculated. Pancreatic polypeptide and neuropeptide Y levels were surrogate markers for parasympathetic input to islets and sympathetic tone, respectively. Responses were compared to those in well-matched non-surgical participants with NGT from our earlier study. Xen similarly increased pancreatic polypeptide and neuropeptide Y responses in patients with and without RYGB. In contrast, the ability of Xen to inhibit GLP-1 release and cause diarrhea was severely blunted in patients with RYGB. With RYGB, Xen had no statistically significant effect on glucose, insulin secretory, GLP-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, and glucagon responses. However, insulin and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide secretion preceded GLP-1 release suggesting circulating GLP-1 does not mediate exaggerated insulin release after RYGB. Thus, Xen has unmasked neural circuits to the distal gut that inhibit GLP-1 secretion, cause diarrhea, and are altered by RYGB.",10.1016/j.peptides.2016.06.001,,,,1502
817,Beta-cell sensitivity to glucose is impaired after gastric bypass surgery.,"Patients who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (GB) have exaggerated postprandial insulin secretion, which has been attributed to increased meal glucose appearance and enhanced incretin effect. Here, we sought to determine Î²-cell glucose sensitivity in the absence of meal stimulation and insulinotropic gut factors. A total of 12 non-diabetic subjects with prior GB, and 7 matched non-surgical control subjects with normal glucose tolerance were studied. Blood glucose and insulin secretion rates were measured during a graded glucose infusion at increasing and then decreasing rates. Insulin sensitivity (SI ) and glucose effectiveness (SG ) were determined by the minimal model. GB subjects had SI comparable to that of control subjects. GB subjects had relative hyperglycaemia during the highest dose of glucose infusion associated with significantly reduced Î²-cell glucose sensitivity throughout both step-up (GB: 34â€‰Â± 6, CN: 82â€‰Â± 9 pmolâ€‰min-1 mM-1 L, P <â€‰.0001) and step-down (GB: 31â€‰Â±â€‰6, CN: 74â€‰Â±â€‰9â€‰pmolâ€‰min-1 mM-1 L, P <â€‰.0001) phases of the glucose infusion. GB subjects also had reduced SG (GB: 0.04â€‰Â±â€‰0.00, CN: 0.07â€‰Â± 0.01â€‰min-1 , P =â€‰.004). In the absence of enteric stimuli, Î²-cell sensitivity to changes in glycaemia is blunted among individuals with GB, indicating a significant shift in a fundamental property of Î²-cell function several years after surgery.",10.1111/dom.13165,,,,1503
811,Decreased visceral fat area correlates with improved total testosterone levels after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in obese Chinese males with type 2 diabetes: a 12-month follow-up.,"Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are recognized as risk factors for hypogonadism in males. Serum sex hormone profiles have not been assessed adequately in obese Chinese males with T2D who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). This study was conducted to examine the changes in sex hormone profiles, anthropometric parameters, and metabolic indexes before and after RYGB. University Hospital, China. There were 45 obese males with T2D who had undergone RYGB enrolled in this retrospective study, focusing on anthropometric parameters, metabolic indexes, and sex hormone profiles before and after surgery. The baseline prevalence of hypogonadism (defined by total testosterone [TT] levels<8 nM) was 33.33%. After surgery, both the levels of TT and sex hormone-binding globulin increased, while the levels of estradiol decreased. However, the calculated free testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone levels remained unchanged. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the visceral fat area was the only significant and independent parameter associated with TT levels at baseline (Î² = -.479, P = .001). After surgery, decreases in the visceral fat area continued to be negatively associated with increases in TT (r = -.411, P = .024). These preliminary results demonstrated that TT could be significantly increased in obese Chinese males with T2D after RYGB; this occurs in part via a reduction in adipose tissue, especially visceral fat. Therefore, RYGB might be a promising therapy to treat hypogonadism in obese men with T2D.",10.1016/j.soard.2017.11.009,,,,1504
934,Thickening of inner retinal layers in the parafovea after bariatric surgery in patients with type 2 diabetes.,"Bariatric surgery dramatically improves the metabolic profile in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We have previously reported a thickening of the retina after bariatric surgery and aimed to investigate these subclinical changes in retinal thickness and vessel calibres in more detail. We examined 51 patients with T2D 2 weeks before and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after bariatric surgery. Retinal thickness was measured with optical coherence tomography and automated segmentation in the fovea, parafovea and perifovea in each retinal layer. Retinal vessels were semiautomatically measured in a zone 0.5-1 disc diameters from the optic disc. The total macula thickened with a peak after 6 months in both univariate (2.7Â Â±Â 0.4Â Î¼m, pÂ <Â 0.001) and multivariate analysis (2.2Â Â±Â 0.7Â Î¼m, pÂ =Â 0.001). The thickening was most prominent in the parafoveal ring 1-3Â mm from the centre and in the retinal nerve fibre layer and outer nuclear layer. A fall in HbA1c (pÂ =Â 0.01) and longer duration of diabetes (pÂ =Â 0.01) were associated with more thickening. The central retinal artery equivalent widened 22.1Â Î¼m (Â±8.9, pÂ =Â 0.01) in the multivariate analysis 12Â months postoperatively. A reduction in blood pressure was associated with less widening of the arterioles (pÂ =Â 0.01). Patients with T2D had thickening of the retina after gastric bypass surgery with a peak 6 months postoperatively. The thickening was most pronounced in the retinal nerve fibre layer and the outer nuclear layer of the parafovea. In multivariate analysis, the central retinal artery equivalent increased at 12 months.",10.1111/aos.13087,,,,1505

1552,In vivo band manometry: a new access to band adjustment.,"By application of a newly developed device for invasive pressure measurements, we have investigated band adjustments monitored by in vivo intraband pressures. With access to the port of the gastric banding device, pressures can be recorded inside the band system at rest and during bolus application with different adjustments of the band. 25 patients (mean age 38.7, mean BMI 45.1, 80% women) had intraband pressure measurements at the first band adjustment 8.2 weeks (range 6 to 17) postoperatively. For this purpose, we adapted a pressure monitoring system with the TruWave disposable pressure transducer of Edwards. All patients underwent gastric banding using the Swedish adjustable gastric band (SAGB) by the pars flaccida technique. In vivo intraband pressures differ from ex vivo intraband pressures. With increasing fill volume in vivo measurements show increasingly higher pressures than ex vivo measurements. This difference can mainly be attributed to the influence of the enclosed tissue. The in vivo intraband pressures correlate with the amount of outflow obstruction. Intraband pressure measurement is an encouraging new access to gastric banding. It appears to be a feasible method to control band adjustment without need for x-ray studies in low pressure bands. We expect physiologically exact adjustments to achieve good weight loss and to prevent esophageal problems in the long term.",10.1381/096089205774859399,,,,1508
1236,Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and calorie restriction induce comparable time-dependent effects on thyroid hormone function tests in obese female subjects.,"Obesity and weight loss influence thyroid hormone physiology. The effects of weight loss by calorie restriction vs Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in obese subjects have not been studied in parallel. We hypothesized that differences in transient systemic inflammation and catabolic state between the intervention types could lead to differential effects on thyroid hormone physiology. We recruited 12 lean and 27 obese females with normal fasting glucose (normal glucose tolerant (NGT)) and 27 obese females with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for this study. Weight loss was achieved by restrictive treatment (gastric banding or high-protein-low-calorie diet) or by RYGB. Fasting serum leptin, TSH, triiodothyronine (Tâ‚ƒ), reverse Tâ‚ƒ (rTâ‚ƒ), and free thyroxine (fTâ‚„) concentrations were measured at baseline and 3 weeks and 3 months after the start of the interventions. Obesity was associated with higher TSH, Tâ‚ƒ, and rTâ‚ƒ levels and normal fTâ‚„ levels in all the subjects when compared with the controls. After 3 weeks, calorie restriction and RYGB induced a decline in TSH levels and a rise in rTâ‚ƒ and fTâ‚„ levels. The increase in rTâ‚ƒ levels correlated with serum interleukin 8 (IL8) and IL6 levels. After 3 months, fTâ‚„ and rTâ‚ƒ levels returned to baseline levels, whereas TSH and Tâ‚ƒ levels were persistently decreased when compared with baseline levels. No differences in the effects on thyroid hormone parameters between the interventions or between NGT and T2DM subjects were observed at any time point. In summary, weight loss directly influences thyroid hormone regulation, independently of the weight loss strategy used. The effects may be explained by a combination of decreased leptin levels and transient changes in peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism.",10.1530/EJE-13-0339,,,,1509
1433,Cost comparison of gastrojejunostomy versus duodenal stent placement for malignant gastric outlet obstruction.,"Gastrojejunostomy (GJJ) and stent placement are the most commonly used palliative treatments for malignant gastric outlet obstruction (GOO). In a recent randomized trial, stent placement was preferred in patients with a relatively short survival and GJJ in patients with a longer survival. As health economic aspects have only been studied in general terms, we estimated the cost of GJJ and that of stent placement in such patients. In the SUSTENT study, patients were randomized to GJJ (n = 18) or stent placement (n = 21). Pancreatic cancer was the most common cause of GOO. We compared initial costs and costs during follow-up. For cost-effectiveness, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated. Food intake improved more rapidly after stent placement than after GJJ, but long-term relief of obstructive symptoms was better after GJJ. More major complications (P = 0.02) occurred and more reinterventions were performed (P < 0.01) after stent placement than after GJJ. Initial costs were higher for GJJ compared to stent placement (euro8315 vs. euro4820, P < 0.001). We found no difference in follow-up costs. Total costs per patient were higher for GJJ compared to stent placement (euro12433 vs. euro8819, P = 0.049). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GJJ compared to stent placement was euro164 per extra day with a gastric outlet obstruction scoring system (GOOSS) >or=2 adjusted for survival. Medical effects were better after GJJ, although GJJ had higher total costs. Since the cost difference between the two treatments was only small, cost should not play a predominant role when deciding on the type of treatment assigned to patients with malignant GOO (ISRCTN 06702358).",10.1007/s00535-009-0181-0,,,,1510
1013,Influence of diet and supplements on iron status after gastric bypass surgery.,"Iron deficiency is common after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, but there is no consensus on the optimal diet quality and quantity for restoring and preserving iron status. The authors explored the impact of dietary and supplemental sources of iron and absorptive factors on iron status. Academic, United States. In a cross-sectional cohort of individuals who underwent RYGB, nutrient intakes from food and supplements were measured using 3-day food records. Blood biomarkers of iron status, including concentrations of ferritin, total iron binding capacity, serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), and the sTfR:ferritin ratio, were assessed by a reference laboratory; iron deficiency was defined as having at least 2 abnormal measures. Associations between iron status biomarkers and dietary predictors were determined using regression analysis. Of the 36 participants, 97% were female, the mean age was 45 years (95% confidence interval, 41-48 years), and body mass index was 32 (30-35) kg/m(2). Iron deficiency was found in 42% of participants. Dietary intake of heme iron, found in meats, was favorably associated with 3 iron status biomarkers (ferritin, Î² = .366; sTfR:ferritin ratio, Î² = -.459; and total iron binding capacity, Î² = -18.26; all P<.05), independent of obesity-induced inflammation. Intake of vitamin C from food contributed to iron status (ferritin, Î² = .010 and sTfR:ferritin ratio, Î² = -.011; P<.05). Use of supplementary non-heme iron, at doses recommended for prophylaxis (45 mg/d), was positively associated with serum ferritin (Î² = .964; P = .029). For patients who have undergone RYGB, consuming high, but realistic amounts of heme iron in meat, vitamin C from food, and adherence to recommended iron supplements can prevent iron deficiency.",10.1016/j.soard.2015.09.007,,,,1511
1103,Intestinal Calcium Absorption Decreases Dramatically After Gastric Bypass Surgery Despite Optimization of Vitamin D Status.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery has negative effects on bone, mediated in part by effects on nutrient absorption. Not only can RYGB result in vitamin D malabsorption, but the bypassed duodenum and proximal jejunum are also the predominant sites of active, transcellular, 1,25(OH)2 D-mediated calcium (Ca) uptake. However, Ca absorption occurs throughout the intestine, and those who undergo RYGB might maintain sufficient Ca absorption, particularly if vitamin D status and Ca intake are robust. We determined the effects of RYGB on intestinal fractional Ca absorption (FCA) while maintaining ample 25OHD levels (goal â‰¥30â€‰ng/mL) and Ca intake (1200â€‰mg daily) in a prospective cohort of 33 obese adults (BMI 44.7â€‰Â±â€‰7.4â€‰kg/m(2)). FCA was measured preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively with a dual stable isotope method. Other measures included calciotropic hormones, bone turnover markers, and BMD by DXA and QCT. Mean 6-month weight loss was 32.5â€‰Â±â€‰8.4â€‰kg (25.8%â€‰Â±â€‰5.2% of preoperative weight). FCA decreased from 32.7%â€‰Â±â€‰14.0% preoperatively to 6.9%â€‰Â±â€‰3.8% postoperatively (pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001), despite median (interquartile range) 25OHD levels of 41.0 (33.1 to 48.5) and 36.5 (28.8 to 40.4) ng/mL, respectively. Consistent with the FCA decline, 24-hour urinary Ca decreased, PTH increased, and 1,25(OH)2 D increased (pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.02). Bone turnover markers increased markedly, areal BMD decreased at the proximal femur, and volumetric BMD decreased at the spine (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Those with lower postoperative FCA had greater increases in serum CTx (Ïâ€‰=â€‰-0.43, pâ€‰=â€‰0.01). Declines in FCA and BMD were not correlated over the 6 months. In conclusion, FCA decreased dramatically after RYGB, even with most 25OHD levels â‰¥30â€‰ng/mL and with recommended Ca intake. RYGB patients may need high Ca intake to prevent perturbations in Ca homeostasis, although the approach to Ca supplementation needs further study. Decline in FCA could contribute to the decline in BMD after RYGB, and strategies to avoid long-term skeletal consequences should be investigated.",10.1002/jbmr.2467,,,,1512
524,Erythrocyte deformability and aggregation in morbidly obese women undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery and effects of oral omega-3 fatty acid supplementation.,"An adequate erythrocyte function is vital for tissue oxygenation and wound healing. The erythrocyte membrane phospholipid composition plays an important role in erythrocyte function and administration of omega-3 fatty acids may provide a means to improve it. To investigate peri-operative erythrocyte function and effects of oral omega-3 fatty acids in morbidly obese women undergoing gastric bypass surgeryMETHODS:Fifty-six morbidly obese women undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) surgery were randomized between a low calorie diet (LCD) during 2 weeks or oral omega-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and a normal diet during 4 weeks. Peri-operative blood samples were analyzed with the Lorrca MaxSIS Ektacytometer for erythrocyte deformability and aggregability. There were no significant differences in erythrocyte function between the groups at any time point. Only erythrocyte aggregability parameters were affected by surgery. At six month follow-up, aggregation index (AI) and cholesterol, glucose and insulin were significantly improved. In this study, oral Omega-3 supplementation did not affect erythrocyte function compared to a LCD. Six months after surgery a significant improvement in AI and metabolic parameters was observed in both groups, contributing to a reduction in the risk at thromboembolic and cardiovascular complications.",10.3233/CH-190777,,,,1513

1430,Superior appetite hormone profile after equivalent weight loss by gastric bypass compared to gastric banding.,"The goal of this study was to understand the mechanisms of greater weight loss by gastric bypass (GBP) compared to gastric banding (GB) surgery. Obese weight- and age-matched subjects were studied before (T0), after a 12 kg weight loss (T1) by GBP (n = 11) or GB (n = 9), and at 1 year after surgery (T2). peptide YY(3-36) (PYY(3-36)), ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), leptin, and amylin were measured after an oral glucose challenge. At T1, glucose-stimulated GLP-1 and PYY levels increased significantly after GBP but not GB. Ghrelin levels did not change significantly after either surgery. In spite of equivalent weight loss, leptin and amylin decreased after GBP, but not after GB. At T2, weight loss was greater after GBP than GB (P = 0.003). GLP-1, PYY, and amylin levels did not significantly change from T1 to T2; leptin levels continued to decrease after GBP, but not after GB at T2. Surprisingly, ghrelin area under the curve (AUC) increased 1 year after GBP (P = 0.03). These data show that, at equivalent weight loss, favorable GLP-1 and PYY changes occur after GBP, but not GB, and could explain the difference in weight loss at 1 year. Mechanisms other than weight loss may explain changes of leptin and amylin after GBP.",10.1038/oby.2009.473,,,,1515

Four hundred and five articles were assessed, and 13 articles of which only one was a randomized controlled trial were included in all 49,331 patients from different regions of the world. The pooled analysis shows that operative time was shorter in LS than in CS (weighted mean difference 36.2Â min; 95% CI 34.7-37.6.; pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). No difference was seen concerning leaks or strictures. The relative risk (RR) of leakage after LS was 80% of the risk after CS; however, the 95% confidence interval (CI) showed overlap (0.58-1.11). The RR of anastomotic stricture after LS was 74% of the risk after CS; however, 95% CI (0.52-1.05) showed overlap. Wound infections were less common after LS than after CS; RR was 27% (95% CI 0.21-0.33). Length of stay (LOS) was 0.65Â days shorter after LS than after CS (95% CI 0.51-0.78).

1279,Concomitant cholecystectomy during laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in obese patients is not justified: a meta-analysis.,"While LRYGB has become a cornerstone in the surgical treatment of morbidly obese patients, concomitant cholecystectomy during LRYGB remains a matter of debate. The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the rate and morbidity of subsequent cholecystectomy after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) in obese patients. A meta-analysis was performed analyzing the rate and morbidity of subsequent cholecystectomy in patients who underwent LRYGB without concomitant cholecystectomy. Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The rate of subsequent cholecystectomy was 6.8 % (95 % CI, 5.0-8.7 %) based on 6,048 obese patients who underwent LRYGB without concomitant cholecystectomy. The rate of subsequent cholecystectomy due to biliary colic or gallbladder dyskinesia was 5.3 %; due to cholecystitis, 1.0 %; choledocholithiasis, 0.2 %; and biliary pancreatitis, 0.2 %. The mortality after subsequent cholecystectomy was 0 % (95 % CI, 0-0.1 %). The surgery-related complication rate after subsequent cholecystectomy was 1.8 % (95 % CI, 0.7-3.4 %) resulting in a risk of 0.1 % (95 % CI, 0.03-0.3 %) to suffer from a cholecystectomy-related complication in patients undergoing LRYGB without concomitant cholecystectomy. A prophylactic concomitant cholecystectomy during LRYGB should be avoided in patients without cholelithiasis and exclusively be performed in patients with symptomatic biliary disease.",10.1007/s11695-012-0852-4,,,,1517

1333,Superior calcium bioavailability of effervescent potassium calcium citrate over tablet formulation of calcium citrate after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Calcium supplementation is commonly recommended for patients after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass to avert bone loss. To test the hypothesis that effervescent (liquid) potassium-calcium-citrate (PCC) might be more bioavailable than a tablet formulation of calcium citrate (Citracal Petite), the present study compared a single dose response of the 2 compounds. The present study was conducted at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School at Dallas. A total of 15 patients who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were included in a 2-phase, crossover, randomized study comparing the single-dose bioavailability of PCC versus Citracal Petite. After following a restricted diet for 1 week, the participants ingested either a single dose of 400 mg elemental calcium as PCC or Citracal Petite. Sequential serum and urine samples were collected for a 6-hour period after the dose and analyzed for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and acid-base parameters. Compared with citracal petite, PCC significantly increased the serum calcium concentrations at 2, 3, and 4 hours after the oral load. The peak to baseline variation and increment in serum calcium (area under the curve) were significantly greater after PCC (P = .015 and P = .002, respectively). Concurrently, the baseline to nadir variation and decrement in serum parathyroid hormone (area over the curve) were significantly greater after PCC (P = .004 and P = .005, respectively). Moreover, compared with Citracal Petite, PCC caused a significantly greater increment in urinary citrate (P < .0001) and potassium (P = .0004) and a significantly lower increase in urinary ammonium (P = .045). In patients who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, PCC was superior to Citracal Petite in conferring bioavailable calcium and suppressing parathyroid hormone secretion. PCC also provided an alkali load.",10.1016/j.soard.2011.11.011,,,,1520

The purpose of this review was to examine the published English language scientific literature in accordance with PRISMA principles to find out if orally given vitamin B12 is adequate for prophylactic purposes in RYGB patients and the appropriate dosages needed for this purpose if it is. We examined the PubMed database for all English language articles examining various doses of oral vitamin B12 supplementation after proximal RYGB in adult patients. The search revealed 19 such articles. The data suggest that oral vitamin B12 supplementation doses of â‰¤â€‰15Â Î¼g daily are insufficient to prevent deficiency in RYGB patients. Higher supplementation doses show better results and it appears that a dose of 600.0Â Î¼g vitamin B12 daily is superior to 350.0Â Î¼g daily suggesting an incremental dose-response curve. It further appears that supplementation doses of 1000.0Â Î¼g vitamin B12 daily lead to an increase in B12 levels and are sufficient for the prevention of its deficiency in most RYGB patients. The review finds that oral supplementation doses of â‰¤â€‰15Â Î¼g vitamin B12 daily are inadequate for prophylaxis of vitamin B12 deficiency in adult RYGB patients but doses of 1000Â Î¼g vitamin B12 daily might be adequate. Future studies need to examine this and even higher oral doses for vitamin B12 supplementation for patients undergoing RYGB.,10.1007/s11695-017-3102-y,,,,1521
1629,Continuous negative abdominal pressure device to treat pseudotumor cerebri.,"To study the effects of an externally applied negative abdominal pressure device designed to lower the effects of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) on headaches and pulsatile tinnitus in severely obese women with pseudotumor cerebri (PTC). Short-term clinical intervention trial in the Clinical Research Center. Days 1 and 3 were 'control' days; on days 2 and 4-6 patients were in the device from 8:00 am to noon and from 1:00 to 5:00 pm, and on nights 7-11 they were in the device from 10:00 pm to 8:00 am. The last four patients were treated in a device with a counter-traction mechanism. Seven centrally obese women with PTC. Headache and pulsatile tinnitus severity were graded by the patient using visual analog scale (1-10) and averaged for the time that the device was in use or not in use. IAP was estimated from urinary bladder pressure (UBP) before and during device use. The internal jugular vein (IJV) elliptical cross-sectional area was measured with B-mode ultrasonography; the timed average velocity was measured by Doppler. There was a decrease in both headache (6.8+/-0.8 to 4.2+/-0.8, P<0.05) and pulsatile tinnitus (4.2+/-0.5 to 1.8+/-0.5, P<0.02) within 5 min, and in headache (to 2.2+/-0.8, P<0.01) and tinnitus (to 1.7+/-0.5, P<0.01) within 1 h of device activation. UBP decreased (P<0.001) from 19.1+/-3 to 12.5+/-2.8 cmH2O. Headache remained improved throughout time that the device was used. During the second week, five of seven patients slept in the device without difficulty and four awoke without headache. There was a progressive decrease (P<0.01) in headache during the day after sleeping in the device at night as compared with days 1 and 3 when it was not used (6.5+/-0.5, day 1; 4.1+/-0.7, day 3; 3.1+/-0.8, day 8; 2.3+/-0.8, day 10). Headaches returned late in the afternoon in two patients; the device was reactivated and headache again improved. Five patients underwent IJV sonography; the IJV area decreased (129+/-53 to 100+/-44 mm2, P=0.06) without a change in IJV flow (1004+/-802 to 1000+/-589 ml/min) with the device. When activated, the device was pulled into the patient, creating discomfort that was alleviated with the counter-traction mechanism in the last four patients. One patient developed a 5 cm area of blisters that resolved when the device was worn over a hospital gown. Decreasing IAP relieved headaches and pulsatile tinnitus in PTC. When patients slept in the device, they awoke without headache or tinnitus, which remained markedly improved throughout most of the following day. This study supports the hypothesis that PTC in obese women is secondary to an increased IAP.",10.1038/sj.ijo.0801519,,,,1522
1201,"The clinical importance of a transcription reverse-transcription concerted (TRC) diagnosis using peritoneal lavage fluids in gastric cancer with clinical serosal invasion: a prospective, multicenter study.","We have developed a novel molecular method of diagnosis using the technique of transcriptase-reverse transcriptase concerted reaction (TRC) for the detection of cancer micrometastasis. This study prospectively examined the clinical importance of the TRC diagnosis with peritoneal lavage fluids collected from gastric cancer operations at multiple institutes. TRC amplification targeting carcinoembryonic antigen mRNA was applied to detect gastric cancer cells in peritoneal lavage fluids obtained during gastric cancer resections from nine different hospitals. A total of 137 patients with a clinical diagnosis of serosa-invading neoplasms were enrolled to investigate the correlation between the TRC diagnosis and patient prognosis. Of the 137 patients, 27 (20%) were positive by cytologic examination. In contrast, TRC targeting carcinoembryonic antigen mRNA was positive in 59 of 137 (54%) patients. TRC positivity was associated with a poorer overall survival in all patients and in the 104 patients who underwent a curative operation. TRC positivity also was associated with the peritoneal recurrence-free survival rate in the 104 curative cases. Multivariate analysis showed that TRC positivity and the pathologic N factor were prognostic factors for the overall survival time. Our prospective multicenter study showed that the TRC test using peritoneal lavage fluids could be a potential prognostic factor to predict patient survival and peritoneal recurrence with clinically diagnosed, serosa-invading gastric cancer.",10.1016/j.surg.2013.10.004,,,,1523
638,Reduced bioavailability of oral amoxicillin tablets compared to suspensions in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass bariatric subjects.,"To evaluate the relative bioavailability of oral amoxicillin (AMX) tablets in comparison to AMX suspension in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass bariatric subjects. A randomized, double-blind, cross-over study was performed on the bioavailability of oral AMX tablets and suspension in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass subjects operated at least 3Â months previously . Doses of 875Â mg of the AMX tablet or 800Â mg of the AMX suspension were given to all the subjects, allowing a washout of 7Â days between the periods. Blood samples were collected at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6 and 8Â hours after drug administration and the AMX levels were quantified by liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis, normalized to an 875Â mg dose and the bioavailability of the AMX from the tablets was compared to that from the suspension formulation. Twenty subjects aged 42.65Â Â±Â 7.21Â years and with a body mass index of 29.88Â Â±Â 4.36Â kg/m2 were enrolled in the study. The maximum AMX plasma concentration of the tablets and the suspension (normalized to 875Â mg) were 7.42Â Â±Â 2.99Â mg/L and 8.73Â Â±Â 3.26Â mg/L (90% confidence interval of 70.71-99.11), and the total area under the curve from time zero to infinity were 23.10Â Â±Â 7.41Â mg.h/L and 27.59Â Â±Â 8.32Â mg.h/L (90% confidence interval of 71.25-97.32), respectively. The tablets presented a lower bioavailability than the suspension formulation and the total absorbed amount of AMX in these subjects was lower in comparison to the standard AMX absorption rates in nonbariatric subjects, regardless of the formulation.",10.1111/bcp.14023,,,,1524
1465,Can nurses impact patient outcomes using a patient-centered care model?,"The aim of this study was to determine if nurses, using patient-centered care (PCC), affect patient satisfaction, perceptions of nursing care, and quality outcomes. The Institute of Medicine proposed PCC as 1 of 6 national quality aims, whereas the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services highlighted integration of PCC as 1 of 12 actions for quality improvement. A total of 116 patients were randomized into an intervention (PCC) or control group. Patients who were to receive PCC were called before admission and cared for by nurses who trained to administer/practice PCC. Control patients received usual care. Both groups completed questionnaires and received postdischarge calls. Length of stay, falls, infections, and adverse events were measured to assess quality of care. No significant differences were found between groups for length of stay, infection, falls, postoperative complications, quality of care, satisfaction level, or perceptions of nursing care. Patient-centered care did not affect patient's level of satisfaction or quality of care. However, findings yielded clinically relevant results regarding patient/staff responses.",10.1097/NNA.0b013e31818ebf4f,,,,1525
1438,Collagen and elastic content of abdominal skin after surgical weight loss.,"Collapsed skin folds after bariatric weight loss are often managed by plastic procedures, but changes in dermal composition and architecture have rarely been documented. Given the potential consequences on surgical outcome, a prospective histochemical study was designed. The hypothesis was that a deranged dermal fiber pattern would accompany major changes in adipose tissue. Female surgical candidates undergoing postbariatric abdominoplasty (n=40) and never obese women submitted to control procedures (n=40) were submitted to double abdominal biopsy, respectively in the epigastrium and hypogastrium. Histomorphometric assessment of collagen and elastic fibers was executed by the Image Analyzer System (Kontron Electronic 300, Zeiss, Germany). Depletion of collagen, but not of elastic fibers, in cases with massive weight loss was confirmed. Changes were somewhat more severe in epigastrium (P=0.001) than hypogastrium (P=0.007). Correlation with age did not occur. (1) Patients displayed lax, soft skin lacking sufficient collagen fiber network. (2) Elastic fiber content was not damaged, and was even moderately increased in epigastrium; (3) Preoperative obesity negatively correlated with hypogastric collagen concentration; (4) Future studies should pinpoint the roles of obesity, and especially of massive weight loss, on dermal architecture and response to surgery.",10.1007/s11695-009-0019-0,,,,1526
1124,Variations in oral vitamin and mineral supplementation following bariatric gastric bypass surgery: a national survey.,"Bariatric surgery (including gastric bypass) is associated with long-term deficiencies in vitamins and minerals, which may have deleterious effects on physiology. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists' (AACE) guidelines regarding post-operative vitamin supplementation have recently been endorsed by the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders (IFSO). Supplements have cost implications. Non-branded multivitamins may have similar compositions to branded multivitamins, but at a lower cost. This study assesses multivitamin supplementation following bariatric gastric bypass in England against AACE guidelines. It also examines the composition and cost of branded and non-branded multivitamins. Micronutrient amounts in common multivitamin preparations were obtained from product literature. Costs were collected from a standard retailer. To determine vitamin prescribing patterns, the 37 NHS hospitals performing bariatric gastric bypasses in England were contacted. Practice was assessed against AACE guidelines. All non-branded multivitamins met AACE guidelines for composition. Most had similar compositions to branded multivitamins, and all were cheaper. There was no standard practice regarding post-operative supplementation among the 35 responding hospitals. Only 7/35 (20%) hospitals followed the guidance for two-tablet doses of multivitamins. Immediately post-operatively, 25/35 (71%) hospitals administered calcium carbonate and vitamin D (none recommended calcium citrate, as recommended by AACE to improve absorption), and only 9/35 (26%) hospitals recommended iron to all patients. Most non-branded multivitamins are lower cost alternatives to branded multivitamins, with similar compositions. The AACE recommendation for two-tablet doses of multivitamins is not being met by most English centres. Calcium and iron supplementation is also inadequate.",10.1007/s11695-014-1425-5,,,,1527
612,LEAP2 changes with body mass and food intake in humans and mice.,"Acyl-ghrelin administration increases food intake, body weight, and blood glucose. In contrast, mice lacking ghrelin or ghrelin receptors (GHSRs) exhibit life-threatening hypoglycemia during starvation-like conditions, but do not consistently exhibit overt metabolic phenotypes when given ad libitum food access. These results, and findings of ghrelin resistance in obese states, imply nutritional state dependence of ghrelin's metabolic actions. Here, we hypothesized that liver-enriched antimicrobial peptide-2 (LEAP2), a recently characterized endogenous GHSR antagonist, blunts ghrelin action during obese states and postprandially. To test this hypothesis, we determined changes in plasma LEAP2 and acyl-ghrelin due to fasting, eating, obesity, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), oral glucose administration, and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) using humans and/or mice. Our results suggest that plasma LEAP2 is regulated by metabolic status: its levels increased with body mass and blood glucose and decreased with fasting, RYGB, and in postprandial states following VSG. These changes were mostly opposite of those of acyl-ghrelin. Furthermore, using electrophysiology, we showed that LEAP2 both hyperpolarizes and prevents acyl-ghrelin from activating arcuate NPY neurons. We predict that the plasma LEAP2/acyl-ghrelin molar ratio may be a key determinant modulating acyl-ghrelin activity in response to body mass, feeding status, and blood glucose.",10.1172/JCI125332,,,,1528
1452,Effect of weight loss by diet or gastric bypass surgery on peptide YY3-36 levels.,"To examine the effect of an equivalent weight loss, by gastric bypass surgery (GBP) or by diet, on peptide YY3-36 (PYY3-36), ghrelin, and leptin levels and to determine the effect of diabetes status on PYY3-36 levels. The increased PYY3-36 levels after GBP may be involved in the magnitude and the sustainability of weight loss after surgery. Of the 30 morbidly obese women who participated in the study, 21 had type 2 diabetes mellitus, and were studied before and after equivalent weight loss of 10 kg by either GBP (n = 11) or by diet (n = 10). : PYY3-36 levels were higher in obese diabetic as compared with nondiabetic individuals (64.1 +/- 34.4 pg/mL vs. 39.9 +/- 21.1 pg/mL; P < 0.05). PYY3-36 levels increased markedly in response to oral glucose after GBP (peak: 72.3 +/- 20.5 pg/mL-132.7 +/- 49.7 pg/mL; P < 0.001; AUC0-180: 51.5 +/- 23.3 pg/mL x min-91.1 +/- 32.2 pg/mL x min P < 0.001), but not after diet (peak: 85.5 +/- 51.9 pg/mL-84.8 +/- 41.13 pg/mL; P = NS; AUC0-180: 68.3 +/- 38.5 pg/mL x min-61.1 +/- 42.2 pg/mL.min P = NS). Fasting ghrelin levels increased after diet (425 +/- 91 pg/mL-519 +/- 105 pg/mL; P < 0.05), but did not change after GBP (506 +/- 121 pg/mL-482 +/- 196 pg/mL; P = NS). Diabetes status seems to be a determinant of PYY3-36 levels. GBP, but not diet-induced weight loss, resulted in markedly increased glucose-stimulated PYY3-36 levels. The increase in stimulated PYY3-36 levels after GBP is likely a result of the surgery rather than a secondary outcome of weight loss. Changes in PYY3-36 levels and ghrelin could contribute to the success of GBP in sustaining weight loss.",10.1097/SLA.0b013e3181a6cdb0,,,,1529
1472,Effect of patient-centered care on patient satisfaction and quality of care.,"A clinical randomized study (posttest design) was conducted to examine whether patient-centered care (PCC) impacts patient satisfaction, perception of nursing care, and quality of care. Differences were seen in 2 of 3 subscales within the Baker and Taylor Measurement Scale. The PCC group rated satisfaction (P = .04) and quality of services (P = .03) higher than controls. PCC may impact patients' perception of the level of satisfaction and quality of care received.",10.1097/01.NCQ.0000336672.02725.a5,,,,1530
1479,"Changes in bone mineral density, body composition and adiponectin levels in morbidly obese patients after bariatric surgery.","Gastric bypass surgery (GBP) is increasingly used as a treatment option in morbid obesity. Little is known about the effects of this surgery on bone mineral density (BMD) and the underlying mechanisms. To evaluate changes on BMD after GBP and its relation with changes in body composition and serum adiponectin, a longitudinal study in morbid obese subjects was conducted. Forty-two women (BMI 45.0 +/- 4.3 kg/m(2); 37.7 +/- 9.6 years) were studied before surgery and 6 and 12 months after GBP. Percentage of body fat (%BF), fat-free mass (FFM), and BMD were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and serum adiponectin levels by RIA. Twelve months after, GBP weight was decreased by 34.4 +/- 6.5% and excess weight loss was 68.2 +/- 12.8%. Significant reduction (p < 0.001) in total BMD (-3.0 +/- 2.1%), spine BMD (-7.4 +/- 6.8%) and hip BMD (-10.5 +/- 5.6%) were observed. Adiponectin concentration increased from 11.4 +/- 0.7 mg/L before surgery to 15.7 +/- 0.7 and 19.8 +/- 1.0 at the sixth and twelfth month after GBP, respectively (p < 0.001). Thirty-seven percent of the variation in total BMD could be explained by baseline weight, initial BMD, BF reduction, and adiponectin at the twelfth month (r (2) = 0.373; p < 0.001). Adiponectin at the twelfth month had a significant and positive correlation with the reduction of BMD, unrelated to baseline and variation in body composition parameters (adjusted correlation coefficient: r = 0.36). GBP induces a significant BMD loss related with changes in body composition, although some metabolic mediators, such as adiponectin increase, may have an independent action on BMD which deserves further study.",10.1007/s11695-008-9638-0,,,,1531

1488,Continuous hemodynamic monitoring during laparoscopic gastric bypass in superobese patients by pressure recording analytical method.,"Morbid obesity, compromising cardiovascular and respiratory function, may increase the risk of anesthesia and was initially considered a contraindication to laparoscopy. The aim of this study was to investigate hemodynamic effects induced by pneumoperitoneum in superobese patients, assessed by arterial pulse contour method. We prospectively studied 10 obese patients (BMI 53 +/- 9 kg/m(2)), scheduled for laparoscopic gastric bypass. After anesthesia induction, patients were intubated and mechanically ventilated. A radial artery was cannulated to obtain hemodynamic data implemented by means of a new pulse contour analysis method-the pressure recording analytical method (PRAM). Data were recorded after anesthesia induction (Tbas), at peritoneal insufflation (T0), at 1, 3, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min after pneumoperitoneum induction (T1, T3, T5, T10, T15, T30, T60), at abdominal desufflation (Tdef) and 5 min after desufflation (T5def). MAP increased after pneumoperitoneum, returning to its baseline after deflation (79 +/- 7 Tbas, 81 +/- 6 mmHg T5def). HR remained unchanged. Systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) increased after pneumoperitoneum induction and progressively returned to baseline (3,903 +/- 330 Tbas, 4,596 +/- 148 T1, and 3,786 +/- 202 dyn s m(2) cm(-5) T5def). Stroke volume index (SVI) and cardiac index (CI) increased after pneumoperitoneum and remained elevated. Stroke volume variation (SVV) decreased after insufflation remaining lower than the basal value (28 +/- 4% Tbas, 15 +/- 5% T5des). Cardiac Cycle Efficiency (CCE) transient decreased after insufflation and subsequently increased (0.029 +/- 0.146 Tbas, 0.008 +/- 0.178 T5def). Aortic dP/dt max increased after insufflation, returning to baseline only after desufflation (0.68 +/- 0.07 Tbas, 0.94 +/- 0.08 T30 and 0.86 +/- 0.06 mmHg s(-1) T5def). As assessed by PRAM, this study showed no deterioration in hemodynamic indices or ventricular performance during laparoscopic gastric bypass.",10.1007/s11695-007-9379-5,,,,1533

1423,Acute parathyroid hormone increase by oral peptones administration after roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in obese subjects: role of phosphate in the rapid control of parathyroid hormone release.,"It is generally considered that changes in serum phosphate levels do not alter parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion in the absence of concomitant changes in ionized serum calcium level in humans. An acute rise in PTH was shown after phosphate administration by intraduodenal gavage in rats. We aimed to study gastrin, phosphate, PTH, ionized calcium (iCa), and blood pH responses to oral peptones in morbidly obese patients before and after roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. These parameters were evaluated in response to an oral peptone load in 24 (18 male and 6 female) obese subjects before and 6 months after RYGB surgery. In 12 gastric bypass patients, we also evaluated PTH and phosphate after peptones plus aluminum hydroxide administration to suppress phosphate absorption. Before RYGB, peptones increased gastrin (P < .001), and decreased iCa (P < .01) without changes in PTH or pH. Both phosphate and PTH markedly increased after RYGB with the peptones oral load (P < .01), without changes in pH, iCa, or gastrin. There was a significant, direct relationship between the increase of phosphate and the increase of PTH in the patients treated with aluminum hydroxide (r(2) = 0.78; P < .0001). Rapid delivery of peptones in the jejunum in bypassed obese patients results in a significant rise in phosphate and PTH, in the absence of changes of other PTH regulators, possibly mediated by a signaling from the gastrointestinal tract. RYGB patients provide an opportunity to study the control of PTH secretion, with potential relevant clinical implications.",10.1016/j.surg.2009.08.011,,,,1535
1106,Changes in vertebral bone marrow fat and bone mass after gastric bypass surgery: A pilot study.,"Bone marrow fat may serve a metabolic role distinct from other fat depots, and it may be altered by metabolic conditions including diabetes. Caloric restriction paradoxically increases marrow fat in mice, and women with anorexia nervosa have high marrow fat. The longitudinal effect of weight loss on marrow fat in humans is unknown. We hypothesized that marrow fat increases after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, as total body fat decreases. In a pilot study of 11 morbidly obese women (6 diabetic, 5 nondiabetic), we measured vertebral marrow fat content (percentage fat fraction) before and 6 months after RYGB using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Total body fat mass declined in all participants (mean Â± SD decline 19.1 Â± 6.1 kg or 36.5% Â± 10.9%, p<0.001). Areal bone mineral density (BMD) decreased by 5.2% Â± 3.5% and 4.1% Â± 2.6% at the femoral neck and total hip, respectively, and volumetric BMD decreased at the spine by 7.4% Â± 2.8% (p<0.001 for all). Effects of RYGB on marrow fat differed by diabetes status (adjusted p=0.04). There was little mean change in marrow fat in nondiabetic women (mean +0.9%, 95% CI -10.0 to +11.7%, p=0.84). In contrast, marrow fat decreased in diabetic women (-7.5%, 95% CI -15.2 to +0.1%, p=0.05). Changes in total body fat mass and marrow fat were inversely correlated among nondiabetic (r=-0.96, p=0.01) but not diabetic (r=0.52, p=0.29) participants. In conclusion, among those without diabetes, marrow fat is maintained on average after RYGB, despite dramatic declines in overall fat mass. Among those with diabetes, RYGB may reduce marrow fat. Thus, future studies of marrow fat should take diabetes status into account. Marrow fat may have unique metabolic behavior compared with other fat depots.",10.1016/j.bone.2015.01.010,,,,1536
675,FGF19 Analog as a Surgical Factor Mimetic That Contributes to Metabolic Effects Beyond Glucose Homeostasis.,"Bariatric surgery has proven to be the most effective treatment for controlling hyperglycemia in severely obese patients with diabetes. We show that fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), a gut hormone, is rapidly induced by bariatric surgery in rodents and humans. Administration of FGF19 achieves diabetes remission independent of weight loss in animal models of diabetes, supporting a role for FGF19 in the hormonal remodeling that restores metabolic function after the surgery. Through an unbiased, systematic screen in diabetic mice, we identified selective, safe, and effective FGF19 analogs. Unexpectedly, a lead FGF19 analog, NGM282, did not correct hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. In contrast, administration of NGM282 resulted in a rapid, robust, and sustained reduction in liver fat content and an improvement in liver histology in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, faithfully replicating another key benefit of bariatric surgery. Our work identifies a strategy for replacing the surgery with an equally effective, but less invasive, treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.",10.2337/db18-1305,,,,1537
1093,Does the closure of mesenteric defects during laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery cause complications?,"A well-known complication of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (LRYGB) is bowel obstruction due to internal herniation (IH). Evidence suggests that mesenteric defects should be closed during LRYGB to reduce the risk of IH. Therefore, surgeons are now closing mesenteric defects during LRYGB using sutures, clips, or fibrin glue. However, it has been reported that complications may arise due to the closure of mesenteric defects. The aim of this review was to summarize the reported possible complications associated with the closure of mesenteric defects during LRYGB. A literature search of PubMed and EMBASE was performed to identify studies related to the closure of mesenteric defects during LRYGB. The studies were screened for the listing of possible complications associated with the closure of mesenteric defects. This systematic review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis recommendations. Thirty studies complied with the inclusion criteria for our analysis, which included 21,789 patients. Reported complications related to closure of the mesenteric defects were: small bowel obstruction because of IH, kinking, and adhesions. IH occurred because of incomplete closure of the mesenteric defects in 1.4% of all patients, 1.2% by the antecolic approach, and 1.9% by the retrocolic approach, respectively. Kinking of the small bowel occurred in .2% of 1630 patients after closure of the mesenteric defects with clips and adhesion formation was found among 4.6% of 152 patients after closure of the mesenteric defects with nonabsorbable sutures. The reported risk of complications caused by closure of the mesenteric defects during LRYGB seems low.",10.1016/j.soard.2014.10.013,,,,1538
554,The Impact of Proximal Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery on Acetaminophen Absorption and Metabolism.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBS), a surgery that creates a smaller stomach pouch and reduces the length of small intestine, is one of the most common medical interventions for the treatment of obesity. The aim of this study was to determine how RYGBS affects the absorption and metabolism of acetaminophen. Ten morbidly obese patients received 1.5Â g of liquid acetaminophen (APAP) orally on three separate pharmacokinetic study days (i.e., pre-RYGBS baseline and 3 and 12Â months post-RYGBS). Plasma was collected at pre-specified timepoints over 24Â hours, and the samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for APAP, APAPglucuronide (APAP-gluc), APAP-sulfate (APAP-sulf), APAP-cysteine (APAP-cys), and APAP-Nacetylcysteine (APAP-nac). Following RYGBS, peak APAP concentrations at the 3-month and 12-month visits increased by 2.0-fold compared to baseline (p=0.0039 and p=0.0078, respectively) and the median time to peak concentration decreased from 35 to 10 minutes. In contrast, peak concentrations of APAP-gluc, APAP-sulf, APAP-cys, and APAP-nac were unchanged following RYGBS. The apparent oral clearance of APAP and the ratios of metabolite area under the curve (AUC)-to-APAP AUC for all four metabolites decreased at 3 and 12Â months post-RYGBS compared to the presurgical baseline. In a simulation of expected steady-state plasma concentrations following multiple dosing of 650Â mg APAP every 4 hours, post-RYGBS patients had higher steady-state peak APAP concentrations compared to healthy individuals and obese pre-RYGBS patients, though APAP exposure was unchanged compared to healthy individuals. Following RYGBS, the rate and extent of APAP absorption increased and decreased formation of APAP metabolites was observed, possibly due to downregulation of Phase II and cytochrome P450 2E1 enzymes.",10.1002/phar.2368,,,,1539
1256,A novel ballooned-tip percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy tube: a pilot study.,"The tip of currently available percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy (PEGJ) tubes frequently migrates back into the stomach. To study the safety of a novel, ballooned-tip, PEGJ tube and assess the risk of retrograde migration into the stomach within 3 weeks of placement. Prospective clinical study (NCT01551095). Tertiary-care center. Seven patients who required post-pyloric feeding were included. Placement of PEGJ feeding tubes. Position of the PEGJ, abdominal radiograph findings, adverse events. Seven patients underwent placement of self-propelled PEGJ tubes during the study period. Technical success was achieved in all patients (100%). All procedures were rated as technically simple, and jejunostomy tubes were placed inÂ <5 minutes during all procedures. Abdominal radiographs showed that the jejunostomy tubes were in the jejunum in all 7 patients at both 1 and 3 weeks after tube placement. Small number of patients and short follow-up. Ballooned-tip PEGJ feeding tubes were safe and easy to place. The presence of the balloon prevented migration into the stomach.

The action of adipokines on the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa Î² ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) and on an increase in sclerostin could be related to these changes. This study aimed to assess the repercussions of weight loss, fat mass (FM), and fat-free mass (FFM) loss and biochemical and hormonal changes on bone remodeling markers after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Anthropometric data, parathyroid hormone (PTH), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), collagen type 1 C-telopeptide (CTX), 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OH-VitD), leptin, adiponectin, RANKL, OPG, and sclerostin of 30 menstruating women were measured preoperatively (Pre), and 3, 12, and 24Â months (m) after RYGB. Leptin (34.4 (14.7; 51.9) vs. 22.5 (1.9; 52.7) ng/mL) and OPG (3.6 (1.1; 11.5) vs. 3.4 (1.5; 6) pmol/L) decreased, and adiponectin (7.4 (1.7; 18.4) vs. 13.8 (3.0; 34.6) Î¼g/mL), CTX (0.2 (0.1; 2.2) vs. 0.6 (0.4; 6.0) ng/mL), RANKL (0.1 (0.0; 0.5) vs. 0.3 (0.0; 2.0) pmol/L), and sclerostin (21.7 (3.2; 75.1) vs. 34.8 (6.4; 80.5) pmol/L) increased after 3Â m. BSAP increased after 12Â m (10.1 (5.4; 18.9) vs. 13.9 (6.9; 30.2) Î¼g/mL) (pÂ <Â 0.005). CTX correlated positively with adiponectin at 24Â m and inversely with leptin Pre; OPG at 3Â m; weight, FM, FFM, and leptin at 24Â m. RANKL correlated directly with weight at 3Â m. Sclerostin correlated inversely with weight Pre and FM at 3Â m. BSAP correlated negatively with 25-OH-VitD at 12Â m, and positively with PTH at 24Â m. RYGB induced weight loss, and biochemical, hormonal, and body composition changes are associated with higher bone remodeling.",10.1007/s11695-017-2546-4,,,,1541

1297,Heme- and nonheme-iron absorption and iron status 12 mo after sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in morbidly obese women.,"The effect of bariatric surgery on iron absorption is only partially known. The objective was to study the effects of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) on heme- and nonheme-iron absorption and iron status. Fifty-eight menstruating women were enrolled in this prospective study [mean (Â±SD) age: 35.9 Â± 9.1 y; weight: 101.7 Â± 13.5 kg; BMI (in kg/mÂ²): 39.9 Â± 4.4]. Anthropometric, body-composition, dietary, and hematologic indexes and heme- and nonheme-iron absorption-using a standardized meal containing 3 mg Fe-were determined before and 12 mo after surgery. Forty-three subjects completed the 12-mo follow-up. Iron supplements were strictly controlled. Heme-iron absorption was 23.9% before and 6.2% 12 mo after surgery (P < 0.0001). Nonheme-iron absorption decreased from 11.1% to 4.7% (P < 0.0001). No differences were observed by type of surgery. Iron intakes from all sources of supplements were 27.9 Â± 6.2 mg/d in the SG group and 63.2 Â± 21.1 mg/d in the RYGBP group (P < 0.001). Serum ferritin and total-body iron decreased more after RYGBP than after SG. Iron (heme and nonheme) absorption is markedly reduced after SG and RYGBP. The magnitude of the decrease in heme-iron absorption is greater than that of nonheme iron. The amounts suggested as iron supplements may need to be increased to effectively prevent iron-status impairment.",10.3945/ajcn.112.039255,,,,1543
227,Intestinal Calcium Absorption Decreases After Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy Despite Optimization of Vitamin D Status.,"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), now the most commonly performed bariatric operation, is a highly effective treatment for obesity. While Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is known to impair intestinal fractional calcium absorption (FCA) and negatively affect bone metabolism, LSG's effects on calcium homeostasis and bone health have not been well characterized. We determined the effect of LSG on FCA, while maintaining robust 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels and recommended calcium intake. Prospective pre-post observational cohort study of 35 women and men with severe obesity undergoing LSG. FCA was measured preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively with a gold-standard dual stable isotope method. Other measures included calciotropic hormones, bone turnover markers, and bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and quantitative computed tomography. Mean Â± SD FCA decreased from 31.4 Â± 15.4% preoperatively to 16.1 Â± 12.3% postoperatively (P < 0.01), while median (interquartile range) 25OHD levels were 39 (32-46) ng/mL and 36 (30-46) ng/mL, respectively. Concurrently, median 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level increased from 60 (50-82) pg/mL to 86 (72-107) pg/mL (P < 0.01), without significant changes in parathyroid hormone or 24-hour urinary calcium levels. Bone turnover marker levels increased substantially, and areal BMD decreased at the proximal femur. Those with lower postoperative FCA had greater areal BMD loss at the total hip (Ï = 0.45, P < 0.01). FCA decreases after LSG, with a concurrent rise in bone turnover marker levels and decline in BMD, despite robust 25OHD levels and with recommended calcium intake. Decline in FCA could contribute to negative skeletal effects following LSG.",10.1210/clinem/dgac579,,,,1544
1529,Internal hernia after gastric bypass: sensitivity and specificity of seven CT signs with surgical correlation and controls.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of seven CT signs in the diagnosis of internal hernia after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. With institutional review board approval, the CT scans of 18 patients (17 women, one man) with surgically proven internal hernia after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were retrieved, as were CT studies of a control group of 18 women who had undergone gastric bypass but did not have internal hernia at reoperation. The scans were reviewed by three radiologists for the presence of seven CT signs of internal hernia: swirled appearance of mesenteric fat or vessels, mushroom shape of hernia, tubular distal mesenteric fat surrounded by bowel loops, small-bowel obstruction, clustered loops of small bowel, small bowel other than duodenum posterior to the superior mesenteric artery, and right-sided location of the distal jejunal anastomosis. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each sign. Stepwise logistic regression was performed to ascertain an independent set of variables predictive of the presence of internal hernia. Mesenteric swirl was the best single predictor of hernia; sensitivity was 61%, 78%, and 83%, and specificity was 94%, 89%, and 67% for the three reviewers. The combination of swirled mesentery and mushroom shape of the mesentery was better than swirled mesentery alone, sensitivity being 78%, 83%, and 83%, and specificity being 83%, 89%, and 67%, but the difference was not statistically significant. Mesenteric swirl is the best indicator of internal hernia after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and even minor degrees of swirl should be considered suspicious.",10.2214/AJR.06.0541,,,,1545
806,"Guanylin and uroguanylin mRNA expression is increased following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, but guanylins do not play a significant role in body weight regulation and glycemic control.","To determine whether intestinal expression of guanylate cyclase activator 2A (GUCA2A) and guanylate cyclase activator 2B (GUCA2B) genes is regulated in obese humans following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and to evaluate the corresponding guanylin (GN) and uroguanylin (UGN) peptides for potentially contributing to the beneficial metabolic effects of RYGB. Enteroendocrine cells were harvested peri- and post-RYGB, and GUCA2A/GUCA2B mRNA expression was compared. GN, UGN and their prohormones (proGN, proUGN) were administered subcutaneously in normal-weight mice to evaluate effects on food intake and glucose regulation. The effect of pro-UGN or UGN overexpression, using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, was assessed in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Intracerebroventricular administration of GN and UGN was performed in rats for assessment of putative centrally mediated effects on food intake. GN and UGN, as well as their prohormones, were evaluated for effects on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in rat pancreatic islets and perfused rat pancreas. GUCA2A and GUCA2B mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in enteroendocrine cells after RYGB. Peripheral administration of guanylins or prohormones did not influence food intake, oral glucose tolerance, and GSIS. Central administration of GN and UGN did not affect food intake in rats. Chronic AVV-mediated overexpression of UGN and proUGN had no effect on body weight or glucose homeostasis in DIO mice. GN and UGN, as well as their prohormones, do not seem to play a significant role in body weight regulation and glycemic control, suggesting that guanylin-family peptides do not show promise as targets for the treatment of obesity or diabetes.",10.1016/j.peptides.2017.12.024,,,,1546
1448,Analysis of fat digestive and absorptive function after subtotal gastrectomy by a 13C-labeled mixed triglyceride breath test.,"In the choice of reconstructions, digestive and absorptive disturbances, resulting in weight loss after subtotal gastrectomy, remain a problem. The aim of this study was to compare fat absorptive function after Billroth I (B-I) and Roux-en-Y (RY) reconstructions after subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. A (13)C-labeled mixed triglyceride breath test was performed in 31 patients after subtotal gastrectomy and in 15 healthy volunteers to assess fat digestive and absorptive function. Seventeen B-I reconstructions and 14 RY reconstructions were performed after subtotal gastrectomy. Fat digestive and absorptive function was determined by percent (13)CO(2) cumulative dose at 7 h. Relationship between fat absorptive function and perioperative factors were analyzed. Gender distribution, mean age, pathological staging, level of lymph node dissection, preservative procedure of the vagus nerve and mean follow-up period in the two surgical groups did not differ significantly. Only the type of reconstruction (p = 0.024) was associated with differences in fat digestive and absorptive function by univariate analysis: B-I reconstruction was superior to RY reconstruction. Fat digestive and absorptive function after B-I reconstruction was superior to that after RY reconstruction, probably because the B-I reconstruction was the procedure that permitted food passage through the duodenum.",10.1159/000220098,,,,1547
1592,Ghrelin: integrative neuroendocrine peptide in health and disease.,"Ghrelin is a novel gastric hormone recognized in 1999 as a mediator of growth hormone release. Since growth hormone is anabolic, an important function of ghrelin may be to coordinate energy needs with the growth process. Newly discovered biologic roles of ghrelin imply that it may have other important physiological functions as well. This is a review of recent clinically relevant, yet less well-known, physiologic actions of ghrelin. Ghrelin has profound orexigenic, adipogenic, and somatotrophic properties, increasing food intake and body weight. Secreted predominantly from the stomach, ghrelin is the natural ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor in the pituitary gland, thus fulfilling criteria of a brain-gut peptide. The brain-gut axis is the effector of anabolism by regulating growth, feeding, and metabolism via vagal afferents mediating ghrelin signaling. However, the wide tissue distribution of ghrelin suggests that it may have other functions as well. Systematic literature review of all PubMed citations between 1999 and August 2003 focusing on clinically relevant biochemical and physiological characteristics of ghrelin. Ghrelin is an important component of an integrated regulatory system of growth and metabolism acting via the vagus nerve, and is implicated in a variety of altered energy states such as obesity, eating disorders, neoplasia, and cachexia. It also enhances immune responses and potentially down-regulates anti-inflammatory molecules. Ghrelin's role as a brain-gut peptide emphasizes the significance of afferent vagal fibers as a major pathway to the brain, serving the purpose of maintaining physiologic homeostasis. The discovery of ghrelin has increased our understanding of feeding regulation, nutritional homeostasis, and metabolic processes. Further characterization of ghrelin's functions will likely generate new pharmacological approaches to diagnose and treat different disease entities including those related to the over-nutrition of obesity and the catabolic response to surgical trauma.",10.1097/01.sla.0000118561.54919.61,,,,1548
1614,Duplex ultrasound assessment of femoral venous flow during laparoscopic and open gastric bypass.,"Pneumoperitoneum (PP) and the reverse Trendelenburg (RT) position have been shown to decrease femoral blood flow, resulting in venous stasis. However the effects of PP and RT on femoral venous flow have not been evaluated in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass (GBP). We analyzed the effects of PP and RT on peak systolic velocity and the cross-sectional area of the femoral vein during laparoscopic and open GBP. We further examined the efficacy of intermittent sequential compression devices in reversing the reduction of femoral peak systolic velocity. Thirty patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 40-60 were randomly allocated to under go either laparoscopic (n = 14) or open (n = 16) GBP. A duplex ultrasound examination of the femoral vein was performed at baseline, during PP and combined PP and RT in the laparoscopic group, and at baseline and during RT in the open group. The ultrasound exam was performed first without the use of sequential compression devices and then with the sequential compression devices inflated to 45 mmHg. The two groups were similar in age, sex, BMI, and calf and thigh circumferences. During laparoscopic GBP, PP resulted in a 43% decrease in peak systolic velocity and a 52% increase in the cross-sectional area of the femoral vein; the combination of PP and RT decreased peak systolic velocity to 57% of baseline and increased the femoral cross-sectional area to 121% of baseline. During laparoscopic GBP, the use of sequential compression devices during PP and RT partially reversed the reduction of femoral peak systolic velocity, but femoral peak systolic velocity was still lower than baseline by 38%. During open GBP, RT resulted in a 38% reduction in peak systolic velocity and a 69% increase in the cross-sectional area of the femoral vein; the use of sequential compression devices during RT partially reversed these changes by increasing femoral peak systolic velocity by 26%; however, it was still lower than baseline by 22%. Pneumoperitoneum and reverse Trendelenburg position during laparoscopic and open GBP are independent factors for the development of venous stasis. Combining the reverse Trendelenburg position with pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic GBP further reduces femoral peak systolic velocity and hence increases venous stasis. The use of sequential compression devices was partially effective in reversing the reduction of femoral peak systolic velocity, but it did not return femoral peak systolic velocity to baseline levels.",10.1007/s00464-002-8812-z,,,,1549
712,Serum Concentrations of Lidocaine During Bariatric Surgery.,"Lidocaine has been shown to be clinically beneficial during bariatric surgery. However, information about lidocaine serum concentrations in this setting is scarce. This prospective clinical trial included 42 obese patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery. They received lidocaine based on adjusted body weight. Administration began with a 1.5 mgÂ·kg bolus of intravenous lidocaine followed by a continuous infusion of 2 mgÂ·kgÂ·hour. After skin closure, administration was decreased to 1 mgÂ·kgÂ·hour until discharge from the recovery room.

1422,Supplemental postoperative oxygen and tissue oxygen tension in morbidly obese patients.,"Subcutaneous tissue oxygen tension (PsqO(2)) is a major predictor for wound healing and the occurrence of wound infections. Perioperative subcutaneous wound and tissue oxygen tension is significantly reduced in morbidly obese patients. Even during intraoperative supplemental oxygen administration, PsqO(2) remains low. Tissue hypoxia is pronounced during surgery and might explain the substantial increase in infection risk in obese patients. It remains unknown whether long-term supplemental postoperative oxygen augments tissue oxygen tension. Consequently, we tested the hypothesis that 80% inspired oxygen administration during 12-18 postoperative hours significantly increases PsqO(2) compared to 30% inspired oxygen fraction. After IRB approval and informed consent, 42 patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery were randomly assigned to receive either 80% inspired oxygen via a PULMANEX Hi-Ox Mask (Viasys MedSystems, Wheeling, IL) (10 L/min) or 30% oxygen via nasal cannula (2 L/min) after surgery until the next morning. PsqO(2) was measured with a temperature-corrected Clark-type electrode in the subcutaneous tissue of the upper arm and adjacent to the wound. Postoperative subcutaneous tissue oxygen tension was significantly increased in the Hi-Ox group: 58 (47.7, 74.1) mmHg vs. 43 (38.7, 55.2) mmHg, P = 0.002. Also, wound tissue oxygen tension was improved during supplemental oxygen administration: 75.2 (69.8, 95.5) mmHg vs. 52.4 (46.3, 66.1) mmHg, P < 0.001. Subcutaneous tissue oxygen tension was significantly increased by supplemental postoperative oxygen administration. Whether there is an effect on the incidence of wound infection in morbidly obese patients is matter of further research.",10.1007/s11695-010-0168-1,,,,1551
1357,Pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin in plasma and tissue of morbidly obese patients.,"To assess the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin in morbidly obese patients. Twelve morbidly obese patients (2 male/10 female, age 25-61 years, weight 98-166 kg, body mass index 43.0-58.2 kg/m(2)) scheduled for gastric bypass surgery were treated with 400 mg of moxifloxacin orally once daily for 3 days and with 400 mg of moxifloxacin intravenously on day 4 (day of surgery). Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on day 1 and day 4. Specimens of small intestine, greater omentum and subcutaneous adipose tissue were collected intraoperatively 1.8-3.7 h after moxifloxacin infusion. Moxifloxacin concentrations were determined by HPLC. The plasma pharmacokinetics (meanâ€ŠÂ±â€ŠSD) was comparable to historical data in normal-weight subjects. Oral bioavailability was 79.6%â€ŠÂ±â€Š11.5%. After intravenous administration, plasma clearance was 9.6â€ŠÂ±â€Š2.0 L/h, volume of distribution was 165â€ŠÂ±â€Š30 L and area under the curve was 43.7â€ŠÂ±â€Š11.8 mgÂ·h/L. Linear regression analysis showed the volume of distribution to be better correlated with ideal body weight, lean body weight, fat-free mass or height (R(2)â€Š=â€Š0.60-0.67, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.001-0.003) than with total body weight (R(2)â€Š=â€Š0.46, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.015). Whereas mean tissue concentrations in small intestine (6.99â€ŠÂ±â€Š2.34 mg/kg) were twice the concomitant plasma concentrations, the concentrations in greater omentum (0.801â€ŠÂ±â€Š0.168 mg/kg) or subcutaneous fat (0.638â€ŠÂ±â€Š0.180 mg/kg) were only one-quarter of those. The pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin is not significantly affected by morbid obesity. No dose adjustment seems to be necessary in this particular population.",10.1093/jac/dkr282,,,,1552

In a randomized crossover study, 11 women who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and had documented hypoglycaemia were each evaluated during a baseline period without treatment and during five treatment periods with the following interventions: acarbose 50â€‰mg for 1â€‰week, sitagliptin 100â€‰mg for 1â€‰week, verapamil 120â€‰mg for 1â€‰week, liraglutide 1.2â€‰mg for 3â€‰weeks and pasireotide 300â€‰Î¼g as a single dose. Treatment effects were evaluated by a mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) and, for all treatment periods except pasireotide, by 6 days of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Treatment with acarbose and treatment with pasireotide both significantly lifted nadir glucose levels (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SEM 3.9â€‰Â±â€‰0.2 and 7.9â€‰Â±â€‰0.4 vs 3.4â€‰Â±â€‰0.2; Pâ€‰<â€‰.03) and reduced time in hypoglycaemia during the MMTTs. Acarbose reduced peak glucose levels and time in hyperglycaemia, whereas pasireotide greatly increased both variables. Acarbose and pasireotide reduced insulin and C-peptide levels, and pasireotide also diminished glucagon-like peptide-1 levels. Sitagliptin lowered nadir glucose values, while verapamil and liraglutide had no effect on hypoglycaemia. During the CGM periods, the treatments had no impact on hypoglycaemia, whereas acarbose and liraglutide reduced hyperglycaemia and glycaemic variability. In an experimental setting, treatment with acarbose and pasireotide reduced PBH. Acarbose appears to have an overall glucose-stabilizing effect, whereas pasireotide leads to increased and sustained hyperglycaemia.",10.1111/dom.13796,,,,1554

1052,Oral iron absorption test should not be performed with iron drops containing ferric iron.,"In an oral iron absorption test (OIAT), the rise in plasma iron concentration after oral ingestion of iron is a measure of intestinal iron absorption. We describe results of the OIAT using two different formulations of oral iron drops. The study included all patients who had an OIAT performed at the Department of Internal Medicine, FarsÃ¸, Aalborg University Hospital, Denmark, from 1 January 2013 to 17 June 2014 (n = 24) using ferrous iron drops ""Glycifer"" and from 18 June to 3 November 2014 (n = 17) using ferric iron drops ""Medic"". A venous blood sample was drawn before and then 90, 180 and 240 min. after the intake of 9 ml iron drops of the ""Glycifer"" brand (270 mg ferrous iron) or the intake of 11 ml iron drops of the ""Medic"" brand (264 mg ferric iron). The patient characteristics (ferrous versus ferric iron drops) were similar in terms of gender, age, haemoglobin, ferritin and previous gastric bypass surgery. The fasting baseline plasma iron concentration was median 5 Î¼mol/l in both groups (p = 0.4). The maximum plasma iron concen-tration increase from baseline after oral intake of the iron drops was median 2 Î¼mol/l (range: 0-8 Î¼mol/l) in the group given ferric iron drops and 48 Î¼mol/l (range: 14-78 Î¼mol/l) when ferrous iron drops were used (p < 0.001).

670,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery influenced pharmacokinetics of several drugs given as a cocktail with the highest impact observed for CYP1A2, CYP2C8 and CYP2E1 substrates.","There is a lack of information about the changes in drug pharmacokinetics and cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolism after bariatric surgery. Here, we investigated the effects of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) surgery on pharmacokinetics of nine drugs given simultaneously which may reveal changes in the activities of the main CYPs. Eight obese subjects undergoing LRYGB received an oral cocktail containing nine drugs, substrates of various CYPs: melatonin (CYP1A2), nicotine (CYP2A6), bupropion (CYP2B6), repaglinide (CYP2C8), losartan (CYP2C9), omeprazole (CYP2C19/CYP3A4), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), chlorzoxazone (CYP2E1) and midazolam (CYP3A). The 6-hours pharmacokinetic profiles in serum and urine of each drug or corresponding metabolite as well as their metabolic ratios were compared before surgery with those at a median 1Â year later. LRYGB exerted variable effects on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs. The geometric mean AUC0-6 (90% confidence interval) of melatonin, bupropion, repaglinide, chlorzoxazone and midazolam after LRYGB was 27 (19%-41%), 54 (43%-67%), 44 (29%-66%), 160 (129%-197%) and 74 (62%-90%) of the pre-surgery values, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of losartan, omeprazole and dextromethorphan did not change in response to surgery. Nicotine was not detected in serum, while geometric mean of AUC0-6 of its metabolite, cotinine, increased by 1.7 times after surgery. There were 3.6- and 1.3-fold increases in the AUC ratios of 6-hydroxymelatonin/melatonin and hydroxybupropion/bupropion, respectively. The cocktail revealed multiple pharmacokinetic changes occurring after LRYGB with the greatest effects observed for CYP1A2, CYP2C8 and CYP2E1 substrates. Future studies should be focused on CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8 and CYP2B6 to clarify the changes in activities of these enzymes after LRYGB.",10.1111/bcpt.13234,,,,1560
1574,Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding induces prolonged satiety: a randomized blind crossover study.,"The sustainability of surgically induced weight loss implies that energy homeostasis is favorably altered. We investigated the hypothesis that laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) induces prolonged satiety and that plasma ghrelin is involved. Seventeen weight-stable subjects who had achieved LAGB-induced weight loss attended blind crossover breakfast tests, one with optimal band restriction and one with reduced restriction. Standardized meals were consumed (0900 h) after 14-h fasting. Satiety visual analog scales were completed hourly (0700-1100 h) before and after feeding. Blood glucose, plasma insulin, ghrelin, and leptin levels were measured. Seventeen body mass index-matched controls were tested. Optimal restriction was associated with significantly greater fasting and postprandial satiety levels than reduced restriction (P < 0.01). Glucose, insulin, ghrelin, and leptin levels did not alter between optimal and reduced restriction. LAGB subjects displayed higher ghrelin (+12%, P = 0.13) and lower glucose (-17%, P = 0.018), insulin (-33%, P = 0.016), and leptin (-32%, P = 0.05) 4-h area under the curve levels than controls. Optimal LAGB restriction increased fasting and postprandial satiety levels. This supports the hypothesis that LAGB provides prolonged satiety, present even during fasting, favorably influencing energy homeostasis. Plasma insulin, leptin, and ghrelin appeared unrelated to the satiety effect and displayed orexigenic compensatory changes. Identifying the mechanisms underlying LAGB-induced satiety may assist the understanding of human energy homeostasis and obesity.",10.1210/jc.2004-1546,,,,1561

No significant difference was found between groups for long-term EW loss (p = 0.082); however, there is a greater decrease in weight loss in RYGB at 6-12 months compared to MGL.",10.24875/CIRU.23000545,1,,0,1565
1,Gastric Cancer in One-Anastomosis Mini-gastric Bypass: Case Report and Systematic Review.,"In the last years, one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) has been proposed more frequently as obesity surgery technique. Several trials have demonstrated that the easier technical feasibility does not affect the long-term surgical result. However, concern about increased risk of gastric and esophageal cancers has been expressed by several bariatric surgeons. The present study reports the 2nd case of cancer of the gastrointestinal-jejunal anastomosis in a OAGB patient focusing the attention on some technical issues correlated and offering a systematic review of the literature.",10.1007/s11695-024-07545-2,1,,0,1566
2,The effect of laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic roux-en-Y gastric bypass on gastroesophageal reflux disease: An updated meta-analysis and systematic review of 5-year post-operative data from randomized controlled trials.,"To evaluate 5-year effect of laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy (LVSG) versus laparoscopic roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) on gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) solely based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A systematic review and meta-analysis of 5-year postoperative GERD data comparing LVSG and LRYGB in adults were undertaken. Electronic databases were searched from January 2015 to March 2024 for publications meeting inclusion criteria. The Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman random effects model was applied to estimate pooled odds ratio where meta-analysis was possible. Bias and certainty of evidence were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2 and GRADE. Five RCTs were analysed (LVSG nâ€‰=â€‰554, LRYGB nâ€‰=â€‰539). LVSG was associated with increased adverse GERD outcomes compared to LRYGB at 5Â years. The odds for revisional surgery to treat GERD in LVSG patients were 11 times higher compared to LRYGB (OR 11.47, 95% CI 1.83 to 71.69; pâ€‰=â€‰0.02; I2â€‰=â€‰0% High level of certainty). Similarly pharmacological management for increasing GERD was significantly more frequent in LVSG patients compared to LRYGB (OR 3.89, 95% CI 2.31 to 6.55; pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.01; I2â€‰=â€‰0% Moderate level of certainty). Overall, LVSG was associated with significantly more interventions (both medical and surgical) for either worsening GERD and/or development of de novo GERD compared to LRYGB (OR 5.98, 95% CI 3.48 to 10.29; pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.01; I2â€‰=â€‰0%) Moderate level of certainty). The development and worsening of GERD symptoms are frequently associated with LVSG compared to LRYGB at 5Â years postoperatively requiring either initiation or increase of pharmacotherapy or failing that revisional bariatric surgery. Appropriate patient/surgical selection is crucial to reduce these postoperative risks of GERD.",10.1007/s00464-024-11303-x,1,,0,1567
3,"Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Leads to Increased Vitamin D Uptake in Patients Undergoing Sleeve-gastrectomy - A Prospective, Monocentric Trial.","Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is often considered to be associated with macro- and micronutrient deficiency. A possible treatment option can be the implementation of pancreatic enzyme replacement (PERT) and may lead to better outcomes. We designed a prospective trial investigating the possible impact of PERT in patients undergoing MBS at a high-volume center. A prospective two-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted on patients who underwent either sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass procedures at a high-volume center. Patients underwent bariatric surgery and follow-up examinations at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Patients were stratified either to the treatment group with PERT or to the control group. The primary endpoint of the study was a change in BMI. Lab testing was carried out to measure secondary endpoints, including albumin and vitamin D levels. Overall, 204 patients were enrolled. Due to missing follow-ups, surgical complications, and side effects due to Kreon medication, 65 were excluded. Analysis of primary endpoints indicates that PERT does not lead to slower weight loss or BMI reduction. Analysis of secondary endpoints showed significantly better vitamin D levels in patients undergoing MBS and PERT. No statistical difference was seen regarding albumin. In both arms, fatty liver disease improved. Quality of life is positively judged as comparable by patients in both groups. Herein, we show an association between PERT and higher vitamin D levels in patients undergoing MBS. An optimized enzymatic environment due to PERT may therefore result in higher vitamin D levels and may improve clinical outcomes in patients undergoing MBS.",10.1007/s11695-024-07526-5,1,,0,1568
4,Long-term Outcome of the Dutch Common Channel Trial (DUCATI): Preservation of Superior Weight Loss Results Without Significant Malnutrition Side Effects.,"The optimal bowel limb lengths for laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) to maximize weight loss while minimizing nutritional deficiencies in severe obesity treatment remain a topic of debate. The multi-center Dutch Common Channel Trial (DUCATI) aims to compare the outcomes of a very long Roux Limb Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (VLRL-LRYGB) with a standard Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (S-LRYGB). A total of 444 patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1, double-blind manner to undergo either VLRL-RYGB or S-LRYGB. Five-year follow-up data were assessed, concentrating on weight loss, obesity-related medical conditions, complications, re-operations, and malnutrition. Both groups had comparable total alimentary lengths (RLâ€‰+â€‰CC). The VLRL-LRYGB group demonstrated significantly greater %TWL (32.2% vs. 28.6%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.002) and %EWL (81.2% vs. 70.3%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.002) at 5Â years. Eight (3.6%) patients in the VLRL-LRYGB group versus 2 (0.9%) in the S-LRYGB group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.055) needed modification surgery for malabsorption. Suboptimal clinical response rate was significantly higher (22.0% vs. 8.3%) in S-LRYGB group. No significant differences for nutrient deficiencies in favor of the S-LRYGB group were found. A 100-cm common channel with a relatively long Roux limb provides superior, sustainable weight loss over 5Â years, without significantly increased rate of malabsorption-related re-operations. These results suggest that a longer Roux limb can still ensure adequate micronutrient uptake in the total alimentary tract. These findings should be considered in discussions regarding the optimal Roux-en-Y limb length for severe obesity treatment.",10.1007/s11695-024-07424-w,1,,0,1569
7,Metabolomic Fingerprints of Medical Therapy Versus Bariatric Surgery in Patients With Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes: The STAMPEDE Trial.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are effective procedures to treat and manage type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the underlying metabolic adaptations that mediate improvements in glucose homeostasis remain largely elusive. The purpose of this study was to identify metabolic signatures associated with biochemical resolution of T2D after medical therapy (MT) or bariatric surgery. Plasma samples from 90 patients (age 49.9 Â± 7.6 years; 57.7% female) randomly assigned to MT (n = 30), RYGB (n = 30), or SG (n = 30) were retrospectively subjected to untargeted metabolomic analysis using ultra performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry at baseline and 24 months of treatment. Phenotypic importance was determined by supervised machine learning. Associations between change in glucose homeostasis and circulating metabolites were assessed using a linear mixed effects model. The circulating metabolome was dramatically remodeled after SG and RYGB, with largely overlapping signatures after MT. Compared with MT, SG and RYGB profoundly enhanced the concentration of metabolites associated with lipid and amino acid signaling, while limiting xenobiotic metabolites, a function of decreased medication use. Random forest analysis revealed 2-hydroxydecanoate as having selective importance to RYGB and as the most distinguishing feature between MT, SG, and RYGB. To this end, change in 2-hydroxydecanoate correlated with reductions in fasting glucose after RYGB but not SG or MT. We identified a novel metabolomic fingerprint characterizing the longer-term adaptations to MT, RYGB, and SG. Notably, the metabolomic profiles of RYGB and SG procedures were distinct, indicating equivalent weight loss may be achieved by divergent effects on metabolism.",10.2337/dc24-0859,1,,0,1570
8,Short-term gut microbiota's shift after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y vs one anastomosis gastric bypass: results of a multicenter randomized control trial.,"Roux-en-Y (RYGB) and one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) represent two of the most used bariatric/metabolic surgery (BMS) procedures. Gut microbiota (GM) shift after bypass surgeries, currently understated, may be a possible key driver for the short- and long-term outcomes. Prospective, multicenter study enrolling patients with severe obesity, randomized between OAGB or RYGB. Fecal and blood samples were collected, pre- (T0) and 24Â months postoperatively (T1). GM was determined by V3-V4 16S rRNA regions sequencing and home-made bioinformatic pipeline based on Qiime2 plugin and R packages. To compare OAGB vs RYGB microbiota profile at T1 and its impact on metabolic and nutritional status. 54 patients completed the study, 27 for each procedure. An overall significant variation was detected in anthropometric and serum nutritional parameters at T1, with a significant, similar decrease in overall microbial alpha and beta diversity observed in both groups. An increase in relative abundances of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria and a reduction of Bacteroidetes, no significant changes in Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia, with an increase of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio were observed. BMS promotes a dramatic change in GM composition. This is the first multicenter, RCT evaluating the impact of OAGB vs Roux-en-Y bypass on GM profile. The bypass technique per se did not impact differently on GM or other examined metabolic parameters. The emergence of slightly different GM profile postoperatively may be related to clinical conditions or may influence medium or long-term outcomes and as such GM profile may represent a biomarker for bariatric surgery's outcomes.",10.1007/s00464-024-11154-6,1,,0,1571

11,Metabolic adaptation following gastric bypass surgery: results from a 2-year observational study.,"Metabolic adaptation is the lowering of basal metabolic rate (BMR) beyond what is predicted from changes in fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) and may hamper weight-loss progression. It is unclear whether metabolic adaptation occurs following gastric bypass surgery (GBP) and if it persists. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reduction in BMR that is not explained by changes in body composition in patients following GBP compared to a weight-stable comparator group. Thirty-one patients [77.4% female; mean BMI 45.5(SD 7.0) kg/m2; age 47.4(11.6)y] who underwent GBP, and 32 time-matched comparators [50% female; BMI 27.2(4.6) kg/m2; age 41.8(13.6)y) were evaluated at 1-month pre-surgery, 3-, 12- and 24-months post-surgery. BMR was measured under standardised residential conditions using indirect calorimetry and body composition using DXA. Linear regression analyses assessed metabolic adaptation post-surgery. After surgery, patients lost a quarter of their body weight [-25.6%(1.8%); pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001] consisting mainly of FM (4:1 FM to FFM loss ratio) at 24-months post-surgery. Absolute BMR (MJ/d) reduced by 25.7% at 24-months post-surgery with values becoming similar to the comparator group from 3-months post-surgery. Positive associations were observed between changes in BMR and changes in FFM and FM (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.03). Metabolic adaptation was present in patients during the 1) rapid weight loss phase (6.9â€‰kg/month at 3-months post-surgery) (pâ€‰=â€‰0.011), 2) slower weight loss phase (1.6â€‰kg/month from 3 to 12-months post-surgery) (pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001), and, 3) weight maintenance phase (24-months post-surgery) (pâ€‰=â€‰0.00073). However, the degree of metabolic adaptation observed in GBP patients was similar to the weight-stable comparator group (no metabolic adaptation) from 12-months post-surgery onwards (3-months; pâ€‰=â€‰0.01, 12-months; pâ€‰=â€‰0.26, 24-months post-surgery; pâ€‰=â€‰0.70). These results suggest that there is a potential biological mechanism of surgery that attenuates the expected postoperative downregulation in BMR thus helping GBP patients maintain weight loss.",10.1038/s41366-024-01585-5,1,,0,1573
13,"Changes in Fat Mass Index and Fat-Free Mass Index Vary Significantly by Age and Sex of the Patient, and by Type of Bariatric Surgery.","The loss of fat-free mass after rapid weight loss following bariatric surgery shows BMI is inadequate for reporting weight loss, emphasizing the need for a more accurate body composition metric. This study assessed changes in fat mass index (FMI), fat-free mass index (FFMI), and dietary intake over 6Â months after one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) across age and sex groups. This prospective observational study included 151 bariatric surgery candidates. Data on demographics, anthropometric, body composition, and food intake data were collected before and 6Â months after surgery. SPSS version 22 was used for analysis, employing ANOVA and t-tests to assess group differences. Younger patients (â‰¤â€‰35Â years) had higher percent total and excess weight loss (%TWL and %EWL) across all bariatric surgeries, and those undergoing SG experienced more favorable changes in fat-free mass (FFM) and visceral fat compared to other procedures (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.002). Males had higher percent change in fat mass index (%âˆ† FMI) and visceral fat than females with OAGB and RYGB (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Women undergoing SG and RYGB had a more significant decrease in energy intake compared to OAGB (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and theâ€‰â‰¤â€‰35 and 35-44 age groups demonstrated lower reductions in energy intake following OAGB. Age, sex, and surgery type significantly affect bariatric surgery outcomes. Younger patients achieved greater weight-related improvements, while men undergoing RYGB experienced more substantial fat mass changes than women.",10.1007/s11695-024-07465-1,1,,0,1574
942,LSG vs OAGB-1Â Year Follow-up Data-a Randomized Control Trial.,"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is one of the most popular bariatric procedure. One anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is rapidly emerging as a safe and effective metabolic procedure. This study aims at comparing the 1-year follow-up results of OAGB and LSG in terms of excess weight loss, complications, resolution of comorbidities, and quality of life. A prospective randomized study of results between 100 LSG and 101 OAGB patients was done from 2012 to 2015. The results were compared regarding operative outcomes, percentage of excess weight loss, complications, resolution of comorbidities, and quality of life (BAROS score). The mean BMI for the OAGB and LSG group was 44.31 and 43.75Â kg/m2, respectively. Percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) for OAGB vs LSG was 66.87Â Â±Â 10.87 vs 63.97Â Â±Â 13.24 at 1Â year (pÂ >Â 0.05), respectively. Diabetes remission was 83.63Â % in OAGB patients and 76.58Â % in LSG patients. Remission of hypertension is 64.15Â % in OAGB patients and 66.07Â % in LSG patients. Bariatric Analysis Reporting and Outcome System (BAROS) was 3.71 in LSG and 3.96 in OAGB. In our study, there was no significant difference between LSG and OAGB in outcome at 1Â year follow-up in % excess weight loss, remission of HTN, and quality of life. OAGB has marginally better outcome in T2 DM remission. However, a longer follow-up is required to establish a correct comparative result.",10.1007/s11695-016-2403-x,0,,0,1575
449,LSG vs MGB-OAGB: 5-Year Follow-up Data and Comparative Outcome of the Two Procedures over Long Term-Results of a Randomised Control Trial.,"Bariatric surgery is a durable and effective way for the management of obesity and resolution of related comorbidities. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcome of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) over long term in a South Asian population. This is a prospective randomised trial comparing the outcome of 100 and 101 LSG and OAGB patients respectively after 5-year follow-up. This study is in continuity with previous published papers with 1- and 3-year follow-up. 71 LSG and 73 OAGB patients followed at 5Â years. The results of these patients were analysed and compared in terms of %EWL, comorbidity resolution and quality of life (QoL) at 5Â years. Bariatric analysis reporting and outcome system (BAROS) was used to assess the outcome of patients. At 5-year follow-up, both LSG and OAGB patients performed well and patients had significant improvement in BMI (kg/m2). The mean preoperative BMI of LSG and OAGB patients was 44.89â€‰Â±â€‰7.94 and 45.32â€‰Â±â€‰8.24, and their mean BMI at 5Â years was 33.41â€‰Â±â€‰6.02, 30.80â€‰Â±â€‰3.40 respectively. At 5Â years, %EWL was 55.95â€‰Â±â€‰27.01 and 65.28â€‰Â±â€‰13.98 for LSG and OAGB patients respectively. The QoL score of LSG and OAGB patients was 1.86â€‰Â±â€‰0.56 and 2.35â€‰Â±â€‰0.41 while comorbidity score was 1.84â€‰Â±â€‰0.68 and 2.24â€‰Â±â€‰0.62 respectively at 5Â years. Both LSG and OAGB are effective bariatric procedures over long term with respect to weight loss, comorbidity resolution and improvement in QoL.

170,Comparison of single-anastomosis gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy on type 2 diabetes mellitus remission for obese patients: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Currently, the increasing numbers of one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) brought this technique in the third position in order of frequency, behind sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). However, OAGB is still considered lack of evidence in reducing obesity- related comorbidities. Our study aimed to compare the efficacy for SG and OAGB improving type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remission and weight loss in obese patients. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing OAGB and SG. Review Manager 5.4.1 was used to analyze the data, and the right effect model was chosen based on heterogeneity. Five randomized controlled trials were included in the study. The remission of T2DM in the OAGB group was more efficient at 1 year and 5 years. Meanwhile, the OAGB group has a greater improvement than the SG group in terms of hypertension (HTN) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Although the percentage of excess BMI loss (%EBMIL) between the OAGB and SG groups was not significant at 6 months, the OAGB group had a conspicuous %EBMIL at 1 year. And 5 years after surgery, a higher percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) was found in the OAGB group. Besides, the OAGB group showed a lower body mass index (BMI) at 5 years than the SG group, but the BMI at 6 months and 1 year were not significant. Finally, at 6 months, the OAGB group exhibited a more remarkable percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) than the SG group. In general, OAGB exhibited a better therapeutic effect in T2DM, HTN, and weight loss than SG in the medium-term follow-up period. To assess the long-term efficacy, clinics should be encouraged to continue longer-term follow-up studies and possibly RCTs.",10.1016/j.asjsur.2023.03.062,0,,0,1577
180,One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB) vs Roux en Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) for Remission of T2DM in Patients with Morbid Obesity: a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Majority of the studies comparing Roux en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) are non-randomized. Moreover, few randomized studies have focussed on weight loss as the primary outcome rather than the impact on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This randomized trial compared OABG over RYGB with the hypothesis that OAGB is not inferior to RYGB in terms of remission of T2DM. This was an open-labelled, randomized trial in which patients having a BMI greater than 30Â kg/m2 with T2DM were included. The primary outcome was the remission of T2DM. In the study, 25 and 24 patients were recruited in OAGB and RYGB groups respectively. The remission rates of T2DM were similar at all timelines. The highest rate was achieved at 1Â year (86.36% vs 85.71%) for both the groups and a 4-year remission rate of (72.22% vs 71.43%), for OAGB vs RYGB respectively. The % EWL was also comparable with the highest rate achieved again at 1Â year (69.23% vs 66.67%) and a 4-year rate of (58.33% vs 53.33%), for OAGB vs RYGB respectively. Remission of other co-morbidities, major and minor complication rate, re-admission rate, and nutritional issues were similar in both groups. OAGB is non-inferior to RYGB in terms of remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus, weight loss, and early and late complications with a shorter operating time.",10.1007/s11695-023-06515-4,0,,0,1578

A literature search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane library and Scopus, in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria (7452 patients). OAGB was associated with shorter mean operative time. The length of hospital stay was comparable between the two procedures. The incidence of leaks, marginal ulcer, dumping, bowel obstruction, revisions and mortality was similar between the two approaches. The incidence of malnutrition was increased in patients treated with OAGB, while the incidence of internal hernia and bowel obstruction was greater in the RYGB group. In addition, the percentage excess weight loss at 1, 2 and 5 years post-operatively was greater for the OAGB group. The rate of type 2 diabetes remission was greater in the OAGB group. The rate of hypertension and dyslipidemia remission was also similar between OAGB and RYGB. Randomized controlled trials, comparing RYGB to OAGB, are necessary to further assess their clinical outcomes.",10.1111/cob.12246,0,,0,1579
577,One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass Versus Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass for Obesity: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials.,"We aim to compare the efficacy and safety outcomes of one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). We searched Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to May 14, 2019, without language restrictions, for randomized clinical trials comparing OAGB with RYGB in obesity. Quality of included trials was assessed by Cochrane Collaboration's tool; quality of evidence was evaluated by GRADE approach. The primary outcome was excess body mass index (BMI) loss at 2 years. We identified 206 reports; after exclusions, three trials with a total of 733 patients were eligible for analysis. Compared with RYGB, OAGB was associated with more excess BMI loss at 2 years (mean difference (MD), 10.22; 95% CI, 3.05 to17.40; I2 = 95%; low-quality evidence), with benefit seen in OAGB using non-obese patients (MD, 17.10; 95% CI, 15.76 to18.44; P for interaction = 0.007 ) and no benefit in OAGB using standard length of biliopancreatic limb (MD, 6.49; 95% CI, - 1.09 to 14.08). Moreover, individuals allocated to OAGB compared with RYGB had a higher remission rate of type 2 diabetes(T2D) (risk ratio (RR), 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.27; I2 = 0%). No statistically significant difference was found between the two surgical groups in adverse events. OAGB is possibly associated with more body weight loss compared with RYGB in patients with obesity, despite the low quality of evidence caused by inconsistent of the effect of biliopancreatic limb length in OAGB group. This benefit appears to be confined to OAGB using the extended length of the biliopancreatic limb but not to OAGB using the standard length of the biliopancreatic limb, compared with RYBG. Additional large clinical studies are needed to assess the impact of limb length in OAGB.",10.1007/s11695-019-04288-3,0,,0,1580
88,"Roux-en-Y versus one-anastomosis gastric bypass (RYSA study): weight loss, metabolic improvements, and nutrition at 1â€‰year after surgery, a multicenter randomized controlled trial.","Although it has been suggested that one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is metabolically superior to the ""gold standard,"" i.e., Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), there is little robust evidence to prove it. Because this result may arise from the typically longer length of bypassed intestine in OAGB, here, the authors standardized the bypass length in RYGB and OAGB and compared weight loss and metabolic outcomes in a randomized controlled trial. The authors randomized 121 bariatric patients to RYGB (nâ€‰=â€‰61) or OAGB (nâ€‰=â€‰60) in two Finnish University Hospitals and measured weight; body composition; metabolic features (insulin sensitivity, lipids, inflammation, nutrition); and comorbidities before and 6 and 12â€‰months after the operation. Total weight loss was similar in RYGB and OAGB at 6â€‰months (mean: 21.2% [95% CI: 19.4-23.0] vs. 22.8% [95% CI: 21.5-24.1], pâ€‰=â€‰0.136) and 12â€‰months (25.4% [95% CI: 23.4-27.5] vs. 26.1% [95% CI: 24.2-28.9], pâ€‰=â€‰0.635). Insulin sensitivity, lipids, and inflammation improved similarly between the groups (pâ€‰>â€‰0.05). Remission of type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia was marked and similar (pâ€‰>â€‰0.05) but the use of antihypertensive medications was lower (pâ€‰=â€‰0.037) and hypertension tended to improve more (pâ€‰=â€‰0.053) with RYGB versus OAGB at 12â€‰months. Higher rates of vitamin D-25 deficiency (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) and lower D-25 levels were observed with OAGB versus RYGB throughout the follow-up (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). No differences in adverse effects were observed. RYGB and OAGB were comparable in weight loss, metabolic improvement, remission of diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, and nutrition at 1-year follow-up. Vitamin D-25 deficiency was more prevalent with OAGB, whereas reduction in antihypertensive medications and hypertension was greater with RYGB. There is no need to change the current practices of RYGB in favor of OAGB.",10.1002/oby.23852,0,,0,1581
549,Predictive Factors of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease in Bariatric Surgery: a Controlled Trial Comparing Sleeve Gastrectomy with Gastric Bypass.,"To evaluate the impact of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) on gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in patients with obesity. Patients with class II or III obesity were treated with LSG or LRYGB. Procedure choice was based on patients and surgeon preferences. GERD symptoms, endoscopy, barium swallow X-ray, esophageal manometry, and 24-h pH monitoring were obtained before and 1 year after surgery. Seventy-five patients underwent surgery (83% female, 39.3 Â± 12.1 years, BMI of 41.5 Â± 5.1 kg/m2): 35 (46.7%) had LSG and 40 (53.3%) LRYGB. LSG patients had lower BMI (40.3 Â± 4.0 kg/m2 vs. 42.7 Â± 5.7 kg/m2; p = 0.041) and trend toward lower prevalence of GERD (20% vs. 40%; p = 0.061). One year after surgeries, GERD was more frequent in LSG patients (74% vs. 25%; p < 0.001) and all LSG patients with preoperative GERD continue to have GERD postoperatively. De novo GERD occurred in 19 of 28 (67.9%) of LSG patients and 4 of 24 (16.7%) patients treated with LRYGB (OR 10.6, 95%CI 2.78-40.1). Independent predictors for post-operative GERD were as follows: LSG (OR 12.3, 95%CI 2.9-52.5), preoperative esophagitis (OR 8.5, 95% CI 1.6-44.8), and age (OR 2.0, 95%CI 1.1-3.4). One year after surgery, persistent or de novo GERD were substantially more frequent in patients treated with LSG compared with LRYGB. LSG was the strongest predictor for GERD in our trial. Preoperative counseling and choice of bariatric surgical options must include a detailed assessment and discussion of GERD-related surgical outcomes.",10.1007/s11695-019-04286-5,0,,0,1582
626,Gastroesophageal reflux-related physiologic changes after sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a prospective comparative study.,"The development of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a major concern as it affects the quality of life of the patients and potentially exposes them to the complications of GERD. The reported incidence of GERD after LSG is up to 35%. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is considered the procedure of choice for patients with morbid obesity with GERD but objective evidence based on physiologic studies for the same are limited. The objectives of the study were to determine the physiologic changes related to gastroesophageal reflux based on symptoms index, 24-hour pH study, impedance, and manometry after LSG and LRYGB. Tertiary care teaching hospital, India. This registered study (CTRI/2017/06/008834) is a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label clinical trial comparing the incidence of GERD after LSG and LRYGB. In this study, non-GERD patients were evaluated for GERD based on clinical questionnaires, 24-hour pH study, and impedance manometry preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. Thirty patients underwent LSG, and 16 patients underwent LRYGB. The mean DeMeester score increased from 10.9 Â± 11.8 to 40.2 Â± 38.6 (P = .006) after LSG. The incidence of GERD after LSG was 66.6%. The increase in DeMeester score from 9.5 Â± 4.6 to 12.2 Â± 17.2 after LRYGB was not significant (P = .7). There was a significant increase in the nonacid reflux both after LSG and LRYGB. The incidence of GERD after LSG is high, making it a contraindication for LSG. LRYGB remains the preferred procedure for patients with GERD. However, more studies are needed to understand the physiologic changes in patients with preexisting GERD.",10.1016/j.soard.2019.05.017,0,,0,1583
776,LSG vs MGB-OAGB-3Â Year Follow-up Data: a Randomised Control Trial.,"The objective of this study is to compare 3-year follow-up results of one anastomosis gastric bypass (MGB-OAGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in terms of weight loss, complications, resolution of comorbidities and quality of life. A prospective randomised study of results between 100 LSG patients and 101 MGB-OAGB patients was done from 2012 to 2015. The results were compared regarding operative outcomes, percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL), complications, resolution of comorbidities and quality of life (BAROS score) at 3Â years follow-up. Follow-up was achieved in 93 MGB-OAGB vs 92 LSG patients for 3-yearÂ period. The average %EWL for MGB-OAGB vs LSG was 66.48 vs 61.15% at the end of 3Â years respectively, which was statistically insignificant. Diabetes remission was seen in 89.13% of MGB-OAGB patients and 81.82% of LSG patients. Remission of hypertension was seen in 74% of MGB-OAGB patients and 72.22% of LSG patients. Bariatric analysis reporting and outcome system (BAROS) with comorbidity in LSG patients and MGB-OAGB patients was 6.03 and 6.96 respectively, whereas in patients without comorbidity, BAROS score was 3.86 in LSG group and 4.34 in MGB-OAGB group. In our study, at 36Â months follow up, there was no significant difference between LSG and MGB-OAGB in %EWL and remission of HTN. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remission rates were higher after MGB-OAGB as compared to LSG but the difference was statistically insignificant. MGB-OAGB patients with comorbidities have a better quality of life and BAROS score compared to LSG patients.",10.1007/s11695-018-3255-3,0,,0,1584
479,Fasting Ghrelin and Postprandial GLP-1 Levels in Patients With Morbid Obesity and Medical Comorbidities After Sleeve Gastrectomy and One-anastomosis Gastric Bypass: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) are among the commonly performed bariatric procedures. This randomized study aimed to compare SG and OAGB in terms of weight loss, improvement in comorbidities, and change in serum ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels. This was a prospective randomized trial on patients with morbid obesity associated with medical comorbidities who were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 equal groups; group I underwent SG and group II underwent OAGB. Outcome measures were percent of excess weight loss (%EWL), improvement in comorbidities, change in the venous levels of fasting ghrelin and postprandial GLP-1 at 12 months after surgery, in addition to operation time and complications. Forty patients (38 female) of a mean age of 33.8 years and mean body mass index of 48.6â€‰kg/m2 were included. Operation time in group II was significantly longer than in group I (86 vs. 52.87â€‰min; P<0.001). There were 6 recorded complications (1 in group I and 5 in group II, P=0.18). The %EWL, %total weight loss, and %excess body mass index loss at 6 and 12 months postoperatively were significantly higher in group II than in group I. Both groups had similar rates of improvement in comorbidities. Group I had significantly lower ghrelin and GLP-1 levels postoperatively at 6 and 12 months, respectively, as compared with group II. OAGB was associated with significantly higher EWL than SG. The reduction in fasting ghrelin and postprandial GLP-1 serum levels at 12 months after SG was significantly higher than that after OAGB.",10.1097/SLE.0000000000000844,0,,0,1585
647,One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass Versus Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass for Morbid Obesity: an Updated Meta-Analysis.,"We aim to review the available literature on morbidly obese patients treated with one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in order to compare the clinical outcomes of the two methods. A literature search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus, in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Sixteen studies were included in the qualitative analysis, and 11 studies were included in the quantitative analysis (meta-analysis), incorporating 12,445 patients. OAGB was associated with shorter mean operative time. The length of hospital stay was comparable between the two procedures. The incidence of leaks, marginal ulcer, dumping, bowel obstruction, revisions, and mortality was similar between the two approaches. The incidence of malnutrition was increased in patients treated with OAGB, while the incidence of internal hernia and bowel obstruction was greater in the RYGB group. In addition, the OAGB was associated with greater % excess weight loss (%EWL) at 1, 2, and 5Â years postoperatively. The rate of diabetes remission was greater in the OAGB group. Nonetheless, the rate of hypertension and dyslipidemia remission was similar between OAGB and RYGB. The present meta-analysis is the best currently available evidence on the topic and demonstrates the superiority of OAGB compared with RYGB, in terms of weight loss and diabetes remission. However, the OAGB was associated with a significantly higher incidence of malnutrition, thus indicating the significant malabsorptive traits of this operation.",10.1007/s11695-019-04005-0,0,,0,1586
419,Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus one anastomosis-mini gastric bypass as a rescue procedure following failed restrictive bariatric surgery. A systematic review of literature with metanalysis.,"Although different procedures have been proposed as revisional surgery for patients who had previously undergone a failed primary restrictive procedure, the ideal revisional procedure is still a matter of debate. A systematic search was performed in all electronic databases to find studies comparing one anastomosis-mini gastric bypass (OAGB-MGB) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) as revisional bariatric surgery for weight regain or intolerance/complications of a primary restrictive procedure. The data regarding sample size, patients' gender, age, primary surgery type, number of perioperative complications, operative time, pre- and post-revisional body mass index (BMI), and excess weight loss % (EWL%) at 1-year follow-up were extracted. Five studies were included in the analysis. The primary bariatric procedures were represented by vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG), laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). About perioperative complications, both RYGB and OAGB-MGB showed a similar rate of leaks but OAGB-MGB had a lower rate of bleedings; considering the progression from pre- to post-revisional BMI, OAGB-MGB reveals a better outcome as well as a shorter operative time. Our meta-analysis has shown OAGB-MGB, used as revisional intervention after failed restrictive surgery, achieves outcomes comparable to RYGB in terms of perioperative complications providing a simpler and more effective technique.",10.1007/s13304-020-00938-9,0,,0,1587
801,FUNDOPLICATION CONVERSION IN ROUX-EN-Y GASTRIC BYPASS FOR CONTROL OF OBESITY AND GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW.,"Obesity is related with higher incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Antireflux surgery has inadequate results when associated with obesity, due to migration and/or subsequent disruption of antireflux wrap. Gastric bypass, meanwhile, provides good control of gastroesophageal reflux. To evaluate the technical difficulty in performing gastric bypass in patients previously submitted to antireflux surgery, and its effectiveness in controlling gastroesophageal reflux. Literature review was conducted between July to October 2016 in Medline database, using the following search strategy: (""Gastric bypass"" OR ""Roux-en-Y"") AND (""Fundoplication"" OR ""Nissen ') AND (""Reoperation"" OR ""Reoperative"" OR ""Revisional"" OR ""Revision"" OR ""Complications""). Were initially classified 102 articles; from them at the end only six were selected by exclusion criteria. A total of 121 patients were included, 68 women. The mean preoperative body mass index was 37.17 kg/mÂ² and age of 52.60 years. Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication was the main prior antireflux surgery (70.58%). The most common findings on esophagogastroduodenoscopy were esophagitis (n=7) and Barrett's esophagus (n=6); the most common early complication was gastric perforation (n=7), and most common late complication was stricture of gastrojejunostomy (n=9). Laparoscopic gastric bypass was performed in 99 patients, with an average time of 331 min. Most patients had complete remission of symptoms and efficient excess weight loss. Although technically more difficult, with higher incidence of complications, gastric bypass is a safe and effective option for controlling gastroesophageal reflux in obese patients previously submitted to antireflux surgery, with the added benefit of excess weight loss.",10.1590/0102-6720201700040012,0,,0,1588
221,One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass Versus Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass as Revisional Surgery After Sleeve Gastrectomy: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"The demand for revisional bariatric surgery after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has increased, but the ideal procedure remains unclear. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to compare the outcomes of weight loss and safety of one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) as revisional procedures for failed SG. Four retrospective comparative studies were included, comprising 499 individuals. Patients submitted to OAGB had a more significant total weight loss (TWL) (MDâ€‰=â€‰â€‰-â€‰5.89%; 95% CIâ€‰-â€‰6.80 toâ€‰-â€‰4.97) after revisional surgery. Overall early complication rate was similar between procedures (RDâ€‰=â€‰0.04; 95% CI:â€‰-â€‰0.05 to 0.12). Limited and heterogeneous data prevent meaningful conclusions, but the present analysis suggests that OAGB has a better TWL after revisional surgery.",10.1007/s11695-022-06326-z,0,,0,1589
350,Assessment and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease following bariatric surgery.,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common disease in patients with obesity. The incidence of de novo GERD and the effect of bariatric surgery on patients with pre-existing GERD remain controversial. Management of GERD following bariatric surgery is complicated and can range from medical therapy to non-invasive endoscopic options to invasive surgical options. To address these issues, we performed a systematic review of the literature on the incidence of GERD and the various modalities of managing GERD in patients following bariatric surgery. Given the increased number of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) procedures being performed and the high incidence of GERD following LSG, bariatric surgeons should be familiar with the options available to manage GERD following LSG as well as other bariatric procedures.",10.1016/j.soard.2021.07.023,0,,0,1590

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of SADI and OAGB as revisional bariatric surgery (RBS) in initially super-obese patients (body mass index [BMI] >50 kg/m2). Academic hospital, bariatric center of excellence, Germany. Observational study of outcomes in 84 initially super-obese patients who had undergone RBS after LSG (SADI n = 42, OAGB n = 42) between July 2013 and April 2018. Follow-up examinations were performed at 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after RBS. The variables analyzed included time between LSG and RBS, BMI, excess weight loss, total weight loss, operation time, and complications. The time interval between LSG and RBS was 45.5 Â± 22.8 and 43.5 Â± 24.2 months for SADI and OAGB, respectively. At the time of RBS, the mean BMI was 42.8 Â± 7.9 kg/m2 for SADI and 43.4 Â± 9.2 kg/m2 for OAGB. The follow-up examinations rates (%) after SADI were 97.6, 92.8, 90.5, 78.6, 57.1, and 100, 97.6, 95.2, 85.7, and 59.5 after OAGB. The BMI at the follow-up examinations were 39.1 Â± 7.2, 34.2 Â± 6.9, 31.2 Â± 5.8, 30.2 Â± 5.3, 29.3 Â± 5.1 for SADI, and 39.5 Â± 8.1, 36.6 Â± 7.4, 34.7 Â± 7.9, 32.9 Â± 6.3, and 31.6 Â± 5.9 for OAGB. The mean operating times for SADI and OAGB were 138 Â± 40 and 123 Â± 39 minutes, respectively. Three patients in the SADI group and 1 patient in the OAGB group developed a major complication within the first 30 postoperative days. SADI and OAGB were effective second-step procedures for further weight reduction after LSG in initially super-obese patients after short to medium follow-up. There was a trend toward higher weight loss for SADI though this did not reach statistical significance. Substantial differences concerning surgery time and complications between the 2 procedures were not observed.",10.1016/j.soard.2020.04.014,0,,0,1593
935,Increased Esophageal Exposure to Weakly Acidic Reflux 5 Years After Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.,"To evaluate the long-term effects of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB) on gastroesophageal function. LRYGB is considered the weight loss procedure of choice for obese patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, long-term instrumental evaluations of GERD after LRYGB are not available. Morbidly obese patients selected for LRYGB were included in a prospective study. We performed clinical evaluation with GERD-HRQoL questionnaire, upper endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and 24-hour impedance pH (24-hour MII-pH) monitoring preoperatively and at 12 and 60 months after surgery. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (no. NCT02618044). From May 2006 to May 2009, 86 patients entered the study and 72 (84%) completed the 5-year protocol. At preoperative 24-hour MII-pH monitoring, 54 patients (group A) had normal values, whereas 32 (group B) had diagnosis of GERD: 23 had acidic reflux, whereas 9 had combined reflux [acidic + weakly acidic reflux (WAR)]. The groups were similar in preoperative age, body mass index, and comorbidities. At 12 and 60 months, significant improvement in questionnaire scores was observed in group B patients. No manometric changes occurred in both groups; 24-hour MII-pH monitoring showed a significant reduction in acid exposure, but an increase of WAR in both group A (from 0% to 52% to 74%) and group B (from 35% to 42% to 77%). At long-term follow-up, esophagitis was found in 14 group A (30%) and in 18 group B patients (69%) (P < 0.001). LRYGB allows to obtain an effective GERD symptom amelioration and a reduction in acid exposure.

379,Indications and Outcomes of Conversion of Sleeve Gastrectomy to Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: a Systematic Review and a Meta-analysis.,"Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is the most performed bariatric procedure. Conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) for SG-related complications such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), insufficient weight loss (ISWL), and weight regain (WR) is increasing. Our aim was to investigate the safety, efficacy, and outcomes of conversion from SG to RYGB. A literature search was performed from database inception to May 2020. Eligible studies must report indications for conversion, %total body weight loss (%TWL), and/or complications. The pooled mean or proportion were analyzed using a random-effects model. Seventeen unique studies (n = 556, 68.7% female, average age at time of conversion 42.6 Â± 10.29 years) were included. The pooled conversion rate due to GERD was 30.4% (95% CI 23.5, 38.3%; I2 = 63.9%), compared to 52.0% (95% CI 37.0, 66.6%; I2 = 85.89%) due to ISWL/WR. The pooled baseline BMI at conversion was 38.5 kg/m2 (95% CI 36.49, 40.6 kg/m2; I2 = 92.1%) and after 1 year was 32.1 kg/m2 (95% CI 25.50, 38.7 kg/m2; I2 = 94.53%). The pooled %TWL after 1 year was 22.8% (95% CI 13.5, 32.1%; I2 = 98.05%). Complication rate within 30 days was 16.4% (95% CI 11.1, 23.6%; I2 = 57.17%), and after 30 days was 11.4% (95% CI 7.7, 16.7%; I2 = 0%). This meta-analysis showed that conversion from SG to RYGB is an option for conversion at a bariatric care center that produces sufficient weight loss outcomes, and potential resolution of symptoms of GERD. Further indication-based studies are required to obtain a clearer consensus on the surgical management of patients seeking RYGB following SG.",10.1007/s11695-021-05463-1,0,,0,1595

The aim of this review is to look at the role of this operation as a revisional bariatric surgery (RBS). Literature review was performed following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and the AMSTAR (Assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews) guidelines. Total 17 studies were eligible. This review reports cumulative results of 1075 revisional OAGB-MGB procedures. Primary procedures included gastric banding (LAGB), Sleeve gastrectomy (SG), vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) and gastric plication. The mean age was 43.1 years and female to male ratio was 3.04: 1. The body mass index (BMI) at primary procedure was 47.05Â kg/m2. The mean BMI at revisional surgery was 41.6Â kg/m2 (range 28-70.8). The mean time between the primary and the secondary operation was 46.5 months (3-264). The mean follow-up was 2.44 years (6-60 months). The mean operative time was 119.3Â min. The mean length of hospital stay was 4.01 days (2-28). The median limb length was 200Â cm (range 150-250Â cm). Leak rate was 1.54%. Marginal ulcer rate was 2.44%. Anemia rate was 1.9%. Mortality was 0.3%. The excess weight loss (%EWL) at 1 year and 2 years was 65.2% and 68.5% respectively. We conclude that there is evidence to consider OAGB-MGB as a safe and effective choice for RBS. Randomised studies with long term follow-up are suggested for the future.",10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.07.007,0,,0,1596
368,Network Meta-Analysis of Metabolic Surgery Procedures for the Treatment of Obesity and Diabetes.,"Metabolic surgery is part of a well-established treatment intensification strategy for obesity and its related comorbidities including type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) are the most commonly performed metabolic surgeries worldwide, but comparative efficacy is uncertain. This study employed network meta-analysis to compare weight loss, T2DM remission and perioperative complications in adults between RYGB, SG and OAGB. MEDLINE, EMBASE, trial registries were searched for randomised trials comparing RYGB, SG and OAGB. Study outcomes were excess weight loss (at 1, 2 and 3-5Â years), trial-defined T2DM remission at any time point and perioperative complications. Twenty randomised controlled trials were included involving 1803 patients investigating the three metabolic surgical interventions. RYGB was the index for comparison. The excess weight loss (EWL) demonstrated minor differences at 1 and 2Â years, but no differences between interventions at 3-5Â years. T2DM remission was more likely to occur with either RYGB or OAGB when compared to SG. Perioperative complications were higher with RYGB when compared to either SG or OAGB. Two-way analysis of EWL and T2DM remission against the risk of perioperative complications demonstrated OAGB was the most positive on this assessment at all time points. OAGB offers comparable metabolic control through weight loss and T2DM remission to RYGB and SG whilst minimising perioperative complications.

147,"Remission of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) after Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG), One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB), and Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB): A Systematic Review.","Background and Objectives: The three most widely performed bariatric surgeries are Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), and one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). Aside from the benefits of weight loss, current findings suggest that these procedures can also induce remission of T2DM (type 2 diabetes mellitus). There are limited data that directly compare these three procedures. This study aims to compare the short-term and long-term remission of T2DM after RYGB, SG, and OAGB. Materials and Methods: Three databases (Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane) were searched for randomised controlled trials, prospective studies, and retrospective studies that compared the effects of RYGB, SG, and OAGB on T2DM remission. Studies published between 2001 and 2022 were analysed. Only patients with T2DM and who had primary bariatric surgery were included. Results: After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, seven articles were included in the review. It was found that all three procedures had comparable T2DM remission. RYGB was noted to have the highest complication rate when compared to SG and OAGB. Importantly, it was noted that other predictive factors such as age, duration of diabetes, baseline HbA1c, BMI, and use of antidiabetic medication play a crucial role in T2DM remission. Conclusions: This systematic literature review confirms the existing data that all three bariatric surgeries induce remission of T2DM. Increasing in popularity, OAGB had comparable outcomes to RYGB and SG in inducing T2DM remission. In addition to the choice of bariatric surgery, there are other independent predictive factors that have an impact on T2DM remission. Further studies with larger sample sizes, longer follow-up periods, and studies that control confounding factors are required in this field.",10.3390/medicina59050985,0,,0,1598
161,Does one-anastomosis gastric bypass provide better outcomes than sleeve gastrectomy in patients with BMI greater than 50? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"In patients with BMI greater than 50, sleeve gastrectomy (SG) may not be adequate to treat obesity. To determine whether one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) can provide better outcomes compared with SG in patients with BMI greater than 50, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted, including a total of nine retrospective studies with a total of 2332 participants. There was a significant difference in the percentage of excess weight loss [weighted mean difference (WMD): 8.52; 95% CI: 5.81-11.22; P<0.001) and percentage of total weight loss (WMD: 6.65; 95% CI: 5.05-8.24; P<0.001). No significant differences were seen in operative time (WMD: 1.91; 95% CI: -11.24 to 15.07; P=0.77) and length of stay in hospital (WMD: -0.41; 95% CI: -1.18 to 0.37; P=0.30) between the two groups. There were no significant differences between OAGB with SG in Clavien-Dindo grades I-III [odds ratio (OR): 1.56; 95% CI: 0.80-3.05], or grade IV complications (OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.18-2.94). The meta-analysis on remission of type 2 diabetes indicated a comparable effect between SG and OAGB (OR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.28-2.16). The OAGB group had a significantly higher rate of remission of hypertension compared with the SG group (OR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.06-2.50). The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that the OAGB accomplished a higher percentage of total weight loss and percentage of excess weight loss at short-term and mid-term follow-up but, there was no major difference between the OAGB and SG operations in terms of perioperative outcomes, complications, and diabetes remission.",10.1097/JS9.0000000000000203,0,,0,1599
67,Quality of Life in Patients Undergoing Revisional Bariatric Surgery: From Sleeve Gastrectomy to Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.,"Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is the most performed bariatric surgery worldwide. However, this surgery may be associated with long-term weight regain and severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), sometimes necessitating conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) to improve quality of life (QoL). We conducted a systematic review on QoL measures following the conversion of SG to RYGB. We searched various databases for studies conducted between January 2005 and September 2023. Four studies, involving 196 participants in total, met the inclusion criteria. Different assessment methods were used to evaluate QoL following the conversion. In the included studies, we observed that GERD symptoms and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use both decreased following conversion to RYGB. Excess weight loss (EWL) was also observed in all studies.",10.1007/s11695-024-07082-y,0,,0,1600
538,Comparative analysis of weight loss and resolution of comorbidities between laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: A systematic review and meta-analysis based on 18 studies.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy are the most common procedures performed in bariatric surgery and both have been demonstrated to have significant effectiveness in treating morbid obesity. However, comparative analysis of their effectiveness has not been well studied. This comparative analysis was conducted to determine whether Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy have the same mid- and long-term outcomes in weight loss, resolution of obesity comorbidities and adverse events (AEs) of treatment. We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases from the establishment of the database to January 1, 2020 for both randomized control trials and non-randomised interventional studies that studied Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with respect to weight loss outcomes, resolution of obesity comorbidities and AEs of treatment. Standardised mean differences, risk ratios and odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals were calculated to compare the outcomes of the groups. Two reviewers assessed the quality of the trials and extracted the data independently. All statistical analyses were performed using the standard statistical procedures in Review Manager 5.2. We included 20 studies (NÂ =Â 2917 participants) in this meta-analysis. Our results showed no significant difference in excess weight loss between Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, with pooled Standardised mean differences of -0.16 (95% confidence interval: -0.52 to 0.19; PÂ =Â 0.36) based on randomized control trials and 0.07 (95% confidence interval: -0.10 to 0.24; PÂ =Â 0.41) based on non-randomised interventional studies. Further, the pooled results showed no significant differences in midterm and long-term weight loss outcomes between the comparative groups. Similarly, no significant difference was found in type 2 diabetes mellitus resolution. The pooled results indicated that patients receiving laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy experienced fewer postoperative complication and reoperation rates, with pooled risk ratios of 1.66 (95% confidence interval: 1.33 to 2.07; PÂ <Â 0.00001) and 1.73 (95% confidence interval: 1.14 to 2.62; PÂ = 0.01), respectively. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was superior to laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in managing dyslipidemia, hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The present meta-analysis indicated that both Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy had the same effectiveness in resulting in excess weight loss and type 2 diabetes mellitus resolution. However, patients who received laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy experienced fewer postoperative complication and reoperation rates than those who received Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was superior in the management of dyslipidemia, hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease.",10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.02.035,0,,0,1601
157,Comparison of Efficacy and Safety Between Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) vs One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB) vs Single Anastomosis Duodeno-ileal Bypass with Sleeve Gastrectomy (SADI-S): a Systematic Review of Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery.,"In recent years, combined restrictive and hypo-absorptive procedures have gained widespread acceptance. The rationale of this systematic review is to compare the safety and efficacy between Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) and single anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S). Eighteen eligible studies were finalized for this review. Weight loss outcomes were greater with SADI-S (5Â years) and OAGB (10Â years). SADI-S offered better resolution of diabetes whereas hypertension and dyslipidaemia resolution were better with OAGB. Although early complications and mortality were higher with SADI-S, late complications were more frequent with RYGB. Both SADI-S and OAGB are as effective as RYGB for weight loss, but OAGB offers lesser complications. However, more data is imperative to determine the next gold standard procedure.",10.1007/s11695-023-06602-6,0,,0,1602
73,One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass as Revisional Surgery Following Sleeve Gastrectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Although sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is the most performed metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) worldwide, some patients require conversional procedures due to weight recurrence or late complications. Recently, one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) gained popularity as a viable option to address those problems. The aim of this meta-analysis is to assess the safety and efficacy of conversional OAGB after primary SG in the management of patients with obesity. Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for articles from their inception to February 2023 by two independent reviewers using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) system. The review was registered prospectively with PROSPERO (CRD42023403528). From 1,117 studies screened, twenty studies met the eligibility criteria, with a total of 1,057 patients with obesity undergoing conversional OAGB after primary SG. The mean age ranged from 28.2 to 49.5Â years, and 744 patients (75.2%) were women. At one year after revisional OAGB, the pooled mean percent excess weight loss (%EWL) was 65.2% (95%CI: 56.9, 73.4, I2â€‰=â€‰97%). The pooled mean %EWL after conversional OAGB was 71.1% (95%CI: 62.2, 80.0, I2â€‰=â€‰90%) at two years and 71.6% (95%CI: 61.0, 82.2, I2â€‰=â€‰50%) at five years. Additionally, resolution rates of diabetes and hypertension were 65.4% (95%CI: 0.522, 0.785, I2â€‰=â€‰65%) and 58.9% (95%CI: 0.415, 0.762, I2â€‰=â€‰89%), respectively. Our meta-analysis demonstrated OAGB as an effective conversional procedure after primary SG in terms of weight loss and obesity-associated medical problems for selected patients. Despite the promising results, further randomized controlled studies with larger sample sizes and more extended follow-up periods are necessary to determine if the OAGB is the best conversional surgery after SG.",10.1007/s11695-024-07056-0,0,,0,1603
388,"Reversal to normal anatomy after one-anastomosis/mini gastric bypass, indications and results: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","This review evaluates the indications and outcomes of one-anastomosis/mini gastric bypass (OAGB/MGB) reversal to normal anatomy. A systematic literature search and meta-analysis was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for articles published by October 1, 2020, including the keywords ""one anastomosis gastric bypass,"" ""OAGB,"" ""mini gastric bypass,"" ""MGB,"" ""reversal,"" ""reverse,"" ""malnutrition,"" and ""reversal bariatric surgery"". After examining 182 papers involving 11,578 patients, 14 studies were included. A reversal was performed in 119 patients on average 23.6 months after the primary OAGB/MGB surgery. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 22.92 Â± 3.47 kg/m2 and the mean albumin level was 25.17 Â± 4.21 g/L at reversal. The mean length of the common channel (CC) was 383.57 Â± 159.35 cm, with a mean biliopancreatic limb (BPL) length of 214.21 Â± 48.45 cm. Pooled estimation of the meta-analysis of prevalence studies reported a prevalence of 1% for reversal. The major signs and symptoms of protein-energy malnutrition were the leading causes of the reversal of OAGB/MGB. Bleeding, leakage, and death due to severe liver failure were the most reported complications after reversal, with an overall incidence of 10.9%. In conclusion, OAGB/MGB reversal has a prevalence of 1% and has a complication rate of 10.9%. Protein-energy malnutrition with hypoalbuminemia was the most common etiology. The mean lengths of BPL and CC were reported as 215 cm and 380 cm, respectively, in the cases. Therefore, special attention should be paid to malnutrition in all OAGB/MGB patients during follow-up to prevent severe malnutrition and subsequent increase in reversal procedures.",10.1016/j.soard.2021.04.013,0,,0,1604
584,Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials Comparing Long-Term Outcomes of Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy.,"Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has overtaken Roux-En-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) as the most common bariatric procedure worldwide. However, there is little long-term data comparing the two procedures. We perform a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing 5-year outcomes of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing RYGB and SG. Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and NHS Evidence were searched for English language RCTs comparing RYGB with SG and assessed weight loss and/or comorbidity resolution at 5 years. Five studies were included in the final analysis. Meta-analysis demonstrates a significantly greater percentage excess weight loss in patients undergoing RYGB compared with SG (65.7% vs 57.3%, p < 0.0001). Resolution of diabetes was seen in 37.4% and 27.5% after RYGB and SG respectively. There was no significant difference between RYGB and SG in rates of resolution or improvement of diabetes. Similarly, HbA1C levels were not significantly different between the two procedures. Resolution of dyslipidaemia was more common after RYGB (68.6% vs 55.2%, p = 0.0443). Remission of gastro-oesophageal reflux occurred in 60.4% in the RYGB group in contrast to 25.0% in the SG group (p = 0.002). Both RYGB and SG result in sustained weight loss and comorbidity control at 5 years. RYGB resulted in greater %EWL, improved dyslipidaemia outcomes and a lower incidence of postoperative gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).",10.1007/s11695-019-04235-2,0,,0,1605
575,A Systematic Review of One Anastomosis/Mini Gastric Bypass as a Metabolic Operation for Patients with Body Mass Index â‰¤ 35 kg/m2.,"One anastomosis/mini gastric bypass (OAGB-MGB) is now an established bariatric procedure for patients suffering from obesity. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the role of this operation in patients with body mass index (BMI) â‰¤ 35 kg/m2. A literature review was performed as per preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. This review reports cumulative results of 376 OAGB-MGB procedures with a mean age of 44.28 years and mean BMI of 29.16 kg/m2 (range 22-35). Females represented 67.67% of the patients. The leak rate was 0.27%. The mean follow-up was 32.6 months (6-84 months). The mean operative time was 89.45 min. The median limb length was 120 cm (range 100-200 cm). The mean fasting plasma glucose (FPG) decreased from 196.97 to 103.28 mg/dL. The mean HbA1c came down from 9.13% preoperatively to 6.14% postoperatively. The total cholesterol levels came down from a mean of 197.8 mg/dL preoperatively to 120.6 mg/dL postoperatively. The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride levels came down from 127.7 and 209.3 mg/dL to 81 and 94.8 mg/dL, respectively. Mortality was 0%. Marginal ulceration rate of 6.3% and an anaemia rate of 4.7% were reported. Low albumin was reported in 1 (0.2%) patient. The mean BMI came down to 23.76 kg/m2 at 12 months. We conclude that there is now satisfactory evidence to consider OAGB-MGB as a safe and effective metabolic procedure for diabetic patients with BMI â‰¤ 35 kg/m2. Randomised studies comparing different bariatric procedures with longer term follow-up are needed.",10.1007/s11695-019-04293-6,0,,0,1606

The number of obese patients with newly onset, worsened, or improved GERD after bariatric surgery in each article were extracted. In the pooled analysis, LSG was associated with a higher risk of GERD than LRYGB (odds ratio [OR] = 5.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.60-7.23, p < 0.001). Compared with LSG, LRYGB had a better effect on GERD (OR = 0.19, 95% CI 0.12-0.30, p < 0.001). LRYGB was more effective for treating GERD in obese patients than LSG and the incidence of newly onset GERD after LRYGB was lower.",10.1007/s11695-019-04218-3,0,,0,1607

1550,Three-year follow-up of a prospective randomized trial comparing laparoscopic versus open gastric bypass.,"To analyze long-term weight loss, changes in comorbidities and quality of life, and late complications after laparoscopic and open gastric bypass. Early results from our prospective randomized trial comparing the outcome of laparoscopic versus open gastric bypass demonstrated less postoperative pain, shorter length of hospital stay, fewer wound-related complications, and faster convalescence for patients who underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass. Between May 1999 and March 2001, 155 morbidly obese patients were enrolled in this prospective trial, in which 79 patients were randomized to laparoscopic gastric bypass and 76 to open gastric bypass. Two patients in the laparoscopic group required conversion to open surgery; their data were analyzed within the laparoscopic group on an intention-to-treat basis. The 2 groups were well matched for body mass index, age, and gender. Outcome evaluation included weight loss, changes in comorbidities and quality of life, and late complications. The mean follow-up was 39+/-8 months. There were no significant differences in the percent of excess body weight loss between the 2 groups at the 3-year follow-up (77% for laparoscopic versus 67% for open). The rate of improvement or resolution of comorbidities was similar between groups. Improvement in quality of life, measured by the Moorehead-Ardelt Quality of Life Questionnaire, was observed in both groups without significant differences between groups. Late complications were similar between groups except for the rate of incisional hernia, which was significantly greater after open gastric bypass (39% versus 5%, P<0.01), and the rate of cholecystectomy, which was greater after laparoscopic gastric bypass (28% versus 5%, P=0.03). In this randomized trial with a 3-year follow-up, we found that laparoscopic gastric bypass was equally effective as open gastric bypass with respect to weight loss and improvement in comorbidities and quality of life. A major advantage at long-term follow-up for patients who underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass was the reduction in the rate of incisional hernia.",10.1097/01.sla.0000197381.01214.76,0,,0,1609

However, the comparative analysis of the effect of them has not been well studied. Thus, this comparative analysis was conducted to determine whether LRYGB and LSG are equivalent for mid- and long-term weight loss, resolution of comorbidities and adverse events (AEs). We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases up to January 1, 2019 for studies that investigated LRYGB and LSG with respect to weight loss outcomes, resolution of comorbidities and AEs. Standardised mean differences (SMDs) and risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to compare the outcomes of the groups.

However, the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) after LSG is high. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the optimal surgical strategy for treating GERD after LSG. West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China. A systematic literature search was performed to identify studies on surgical treatments for GERD after LSG. The effectiveness and safety profile of surgical management on GERD after LSG were analyzed. A total of 40 articles enrolling 2049 patients were included in this review. Surgical strategies to prevent GERD after LSG were mainly of 2 types: concomitant LSG + antireflux procedures (hiatal hernia repair or fundoplication) and secondary procedures (conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [RYGB] or repeat sleeve gastrectomy). The short-term remission or improvement rate of GERD was 34.6%-100% after concomitant LSG + antireflux procedures. The postoperative complication rate was the same (3.0%) for both LSG + antireflux procedures and LSG alone. The remission or improvement rate of GERD was 57.1%-100% after conversion to RYGB and 100% after repeat sleeve gastrectomy. The effectiveness and safety profile of concomitant LSG + antireflux procedures is uncertain. However, secondary operations after LSG, such as conversion to RYGB, appear to provide good results. The data overall are heterogeneous, with imprecise methods of documenting andÂ defining GERD complicating LSG.

799,Effect of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy vs Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass on Weight Loss in Patients With Morbid Obesity: The SM-BOSS Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Sleeve gastrectomy is increasingly used in the treatment of morbid obesity, but its long-term outcome vs the standard Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure is unknown. To determine whether there are differences between sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in terms of weight loss, changes in comorbidities, increase in quality of life, and adverse events. The Swiss Multicenter Bypass or Sleeve Study (SM-BOSS), a 2-group randomized trial, was conducted from January 2007 until November 2011 (last follow-up in March 2017). Of 3971 morbidly obese patients evaluated for bariatric surgery at 4 Swiss bariatric centers, 217 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with a 5-year follow-up period. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (n = 107) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 110). The primary end point was weight loss, expressed as percentage excess body mass index (BMI) loss. Exploratory end points were changes in comorbidities and adverse events. Among the 217 patients (mean age, 45.5 years; 72% women; mean BMI, 43.9) 205 (94.5%) completed the trial. Excess BMI loss was not significantly different at 5 years: for sleeve gastrectomy, 61.1%, vs Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 68.3% (absolute difference, -7.18%; 95% CI, -14.30% to -0.06%; Pâ€‰=â€‰.22 after adjustment for multiple comparisons). Gastric reflux remission was observed more frequently after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (60.4%) than after sleeve gastrectomy (25.0%). Gastric reflux worsened (more symptoms or increase in therapy) more often after sleeve gastrectomy (31.8%) than after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (6.3%). The number of patients with reoperations or interventions was 16/101 (15.8%) after sleeve gastrectomy and 23/104 (22.1%) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Among patients with morbid obesity, there was no significant difference in excess BMI loss between laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass at 5 years of follow-up after surgery. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00356213.",10.1001/jama.2017.20897,0,,0,1612

A laparoscopic surgical technique of gastric bypass simultaneous with combined upper total and lower left partial fundoplication. This described case is a participant in an ongoing randomized clinical trial. The patient was without complications and was discharged on the third postoperative day. Delta BMI was 14Â kg/m2 (38-24) at the 1-year follow-up. The patient did not have heartburn or bile reflux esophagitis after surgery. Evaluation of the mucosa of the esophagus by upper endoscopy after each of the 3 follow-up visits demonstrated that reflux esophagitis had resolved. Intraoperative fluorescence imaging technologies (NIR/ICG) (IMAGE1 Sâ„¢ RubinaÂ®) were to determine the quality of blood supply-no violation of the blood supply to the fundoplication wrap of the gastric pouch was detected. A CT scan clearly shows a fundoplication ring around the esophagus (two-thirds) and the upper part of the gastric pouch (one-third).

These surgical modifications address most BPD-DS hurdles, but the risk of bile reflux may hinder SADI-S acceptance. We aimed to evaluate the event rate of bile reflux after SADI-S. PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were used to search English articles between 2008 and 2021 by two independent reviewers using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA). The risk of bias was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the JBI tool. Event rates were meta-analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CME) V3. Out of 3,027 studies analyzed, seven were included. Studies were published between 2010 and 2020. Six out of 7 studies were retrospective. Three studies had a low risk of bias, three studies had a moderate risk of bias, and one had a high risk of bias. The mean follow-up was 10.3Â months. The total number of patients was 2,029, with 25 reports of bile reflux, resulting in an incidence of 1.23%, with an event rate of 0.016 (95% CI 0.004 to 0.055).

307,Gastroesophageal Cancer After Gastric Bypass Surgeries: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Data comparing the occurrence of gastroesophageal cancer after gastric bypass procedures are lacking and are only available in the form of case reports. We perform in this study a systematic review and a meta-analysis of all the reported cases of gastroesophageal cancer following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and loop gastric bypass-one anastomosis gastric bypass/mini gastric bypass (LGB-OAGB/MGB). We conducted a systematic review of all the reported cases in articles referenced in PubMed/Medline, Cochrane, and Scholar Google. Only cases of gastro-esophageal adenocarcinoma following RYGB or LGB-OAGB/MGB are included. Statistical analysis was done accordingly. Fifty cases were identified, along with 2 reported in this paper. Sixty-one percent (27/44) of the cancers after RYGB were in the gastric tube compared to 37.5% (3/8) after LGB-OAGB/MGB. This resulted in an odds ratio of 0.38 (p-valueâ€‰=â€‰0.26), which failed to prove an increase in cancer occurrence in the gastric tube after LGB-MGB/OAGB compared to RYGB. The most common symptoms were dysphagia for cancers occurring in the gastric tube (15/30) and abdominal pain for those occurring in the excluded stomach (10/22). Twenty-nine/thirty of the cancers in the gastric tube were diagnosed by gastroscopy and 13/22 of the cancers in the excluded stomach were diagnosed by CT scan. Gastroesophageal cancers after gastric bypass procedures occur commonly in the excluded stomach where many are not identified by conventional means. Physician awareness and patient education as well as lifelong follow-up are essential for maintaining bypass surgeries on the beneficial side.",10.1007/s11695-022-05921-4,0,,0,1615

Our study evaluated OAGB characteristics and resulting weight evolution, plus surgical success criteria based on various excess weight loss indicators. A prospective observational study of 100 patients undergoing OAGB performed by the same surgical team (two-year follow-up). Surgical characteristics were: surgery duration, associated complications, bowel loop length, hospital stay, and weight loss at 6 postoperative points. 100 patients were treated (71 women, 29 men); mean initial age was 42.61 years and mean BMI, 42.61â€‰Â±â€‰6.66â€‰kg/m2. Mean surgery duration was 97.84â€‰Â±â€‰12.54â€‰minutes; biliopancreatic loop length was 274.95â€‰Â±â€‰23.69â€‰cm. Average hospital stay was 24â€‰hours in 98% of patients; no surgical complications arose. Weight decreased significantly during follow-up (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Greatest weight loss was observed at 12 months postsurgery (68.56â€‰Â±â€‰13.10â€‰kg). Relative weight loss showed significant positive correlation, with greatest weight loss at 12 months and %excess BMI lossâ€‰>â€‰50% achieved from the 3-month follow-up in 92.46% of patients. OAGB seems to be effective in treating obesity, with short hospital stays. Relative weight loss correlates optimally with absolute outcomes, but both measures should be used to evaluate surgical results.",10.1038/s41598-018-20303-6,0,,0,1616
418,Surgical treatment of recalcitrant gastroesophageal reflux disease in patients with systemic sclerosis: a systematic review.,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is frequently seen in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). Long-standing GERD may cause esophagitis, long-segment strictures, and Barrett's esophagus and may worsen pre-existing pulmonary fibrosis with an increased risk of end-stage lung disease. Surgical treatment of recalcitrant GERD remains controversial. The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the current data on surgical treatment of recalcitrant GERD in SSc patients. A systematic literature review according to PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were consulted. A total of 101 patients were included from 7 studies. The age ranged from 34 to 61 years and the majority were females (73.5%). Commonly reported symptoms were heartburn (92%), regurgitation (77%), and dysphagia (74%). Concurrent pulmonary disease was diagnosed in 58% of patients. Overall, 63 patients (62.4%) underwent open fundoplication, 17 (16.8%) laparoscopic fundoplication, 15 (14.9%) Roux en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and 6 (5.9%) esophagectomy. The postoperative follow-up ranged from 12 to 65 months. Recurrent symptoms were described in up to 70% and 30% of patients undergoing fundoplication and RYGB, respectively. Various symptoms were reported postoperatively depending on the type of surgical procedures, anatomy of the valve, need for esophageal lengthening, and follow-up. The treatment of recalcitrant GERD in SSc patients is challenging. Esophagectomy should be reserved to selected patients. Minimally invasive RYGB appears feasible and safe with promising preliminary short-term results. Current evidence is scarce while a definitive indication about the most appropriate surgical treatment is lacking.",10.1007/s00423-021-02118-8,0,,0,1617
1197,Comparison of the long-term results of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and nonrandomized trials.,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are 2 of the most widely used bariatric procedures today, in this meta-analysis, both techniques were compared for evaluating the efficacy and safety of the treatment of morbid obesity. Systematic literature search of Cochrane Controlled Trials Register Databases, Medline, Embase, ISI databases, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database was performed. Statistical analyses were carried out using RevMan software. Thirty-two recent studies including 6526 patients in total were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with SG, RYGB had significantly better effect in resolving type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and arthritis. However, RYGB had higher incidence of complications and reoperation, and longer operation time than SG. RYGB was more effective than SG in the resolution of obesity-related comorbidities, SG was a safer procedure with a reduced rate of complications and reoperation.",10.1097/SLE.0000000000000041,0,,0,1618
625,Clinical Outcomes of Sleeve Gastrectomy Versus Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass After Failed Adjustable Gastric Banding.,"Over recent decades, laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) has been among the most common bariatric surgeries. Nowadays, many patients require revision surgery due to insufficient weight loss and band-related complications. Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) are the two most common revision surgeries for failed LAGB, but the conclusions about their efficacy and safety have been inconsistent. This meta-analysis aimed to review the clinical outcomes of SG and RYGB after failed LAGB. In accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases were systematically searched for articles that had studied the efficacy and safety of SG and RYGB. The most appropriate effects model was chosen based on the heterogeneity of the articles included in this meta-analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted using Stata 14.0. Of 586 articles that were retrieved, 16 articles which examined 2141 SG and 2990 RYGB patients met the inclusion criteria. The patients in RYGB groups showed increased percent excess weight loss (%EWL) at 12 and 24Â months after revision surgery but no statistically significant change was found about %EWL after 3, 6, or 36Â months. In addition, RYGB was associated with a higher rate of complications, interventions, and readmission in addition to being of more operative time. This review suggested that RYGB was more effective at demonstrating weight loss after 12 and 24Â months, but comparisons of the long-term efficacy of RYGB with that of SG remain inconclusive. In addition, RYGB was accompanied by a greater number of post-operative complications, interventions, and readmissions. Thus, surgeons should consider the overall status of the patients and their comorbidities as crucial factors when selecting a form of revision surgery. Additional high-quality randomized controlled studies are required to further compare the efficacy and safety of these treatments with longer follow-up times.",10.1007/s11695-019-03988-0,0,,0,1619
759,Long-term follow-up after sleeve gastrectomy versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus one-anastomosis gastric bypass: a prospective randomized comparative study of weight loss and remission of comorbidities.,"One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB) has exponentially increased in the last decade, as it is associated with very low complications, mortality, readmissions and reoperations rates, and shows excellent short- and long-term benefits of weight loss and resolution of comorbidities. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of SG, RYGB, and OAGB, on short- and long-term weight loss and comorbidities resolution. A prospective randomized clinical study of all morbidly obese patients undergoing SG, RYGB, and OAGB, as primary bariatric procedures, was performed. Patients were randomly assigned into 3 groups: those patients undergoing SG, those ones undergoing RYGB and those ones undergoing OAGB. BMI, excess BMI loss (EBMIL) and remission of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), hypertension (HT), and dyslipidemia (DL) were assessed. 600 patients were included in the study, 200 in each group. Follow-up rate at 5Â years postoperatively was 91% in SG group, 92% in RYGB, and 90% in OAGB. OAGB achieves significantly greater EBMIL than RYGB and SG at 1, 2, and 5Â years (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001, respectively). At 5 years, OAGB achieves significantly greater remission of T2DM (pâ€‰=â€‰0.027), HT (pâ€‰=â€‰0.006), and DL (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) than RYGB and SG. RYGB did not show significant superiority than SG in short- and long-term remission of T2DM and HT, but achieves greater remission of DL (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). OAGB achieves superior mid- and long-term weight loss than RYGB and SG. There are no significant differences in weight loss between SG and RYGB at 1, 2, and 5Â years. OAGB achieves better short- and long-term resolution rates of DM, HT, and DL than SG and RYGB. RYGB and SG obtain similar T2DM and HT remissions, but RYGB reaches significantly greater rates of DL remission. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03467646.",10.1007/s00464-018-6307-9,0,,0,1620
296,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or one-anastomosis gastric bypass? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials.","This study aimed to determine which bariatric procedure allows patients to obtain the best weight-loss outcomes and a remission of type 2 diabetes. Databases were searched for randomized-controlled trials comparing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) with sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). The mean difference (MD) or the relative risk was determined. Twenty-five randomized-controlled trials were analyzed. Excess weight loss (EWL, percentage) was greater for RYGB patients at 3 years (MD: 11.93, p < 0.00001) and 5 years (MD: 13.11, p = 0.0004). Higher excess BMI loss (percentage) was found in RYGB at 1 year (MD: 11.66, p = 0.01). Total weight loss (percentage) was greater for RYGB patients after 3 months (MD: 2.41, p = 0.02), 6 months (MD: 3.83, p < 0.00001), 1 year (MD: 6.35, pÂ <Â 0.00001), and 5 years (MD: 3.90, p = 0.005). No difference in terms of remission of type 2 diabetes was seen between RYGB and SG. EWL was significantly more important after OAGB than after RYGB after 1 year (MD: -10.82, p = 0.003). RYGB is more efficient than SG in the midterm. OAGB offers greater EWL than RYGB after 1 year, but further evidence is needed to confirm this result.",10.1002/oby.23338,0,,0,1621
773,"Probiotic Supplementation in Morbid Obese Patients Undergoing One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass-Mini Gastric Bypass (OAGB-MGB) Surgery: a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Clinical Trial.","Bariatric surgery is known as one of the most effective treatments for sustainable weight loss; however, it may be associated with some complications. This study was designed to examine the effects of probiotic supplementation on some morbidities related to this surgery. This was a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial on morbid obese patients referred for One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass- Mini Gastric Bypass (OAGB-MGB) surgery to a tertiary referral center. Patients were assigned to receive a probiotic supplement (FamilactÂ®) or placebo from 4Â weeks prior to surgery to 12Â weeks after surgery. Anthropometric, biochemical, and inflammatory indices were evaluated at the beginning and the end of the study. At the end of study, significant improvements in some serum inflammatory markers, vitamin D status, and anthropometric measurements were observed (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), which were significantly more in probiotic group rather than placebo group (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Moreover, significant improvements in glycemic indices and lipid profile were observed in both groups; however, these changes were not significantly different between the groups. There was no significant difference in serum levels of vitamin B12, folate, and homocysteine between groups at week 16 of the study. Our results indicate that probiotic supplementation promotes inflammatory markers, body weight loss, and status of vitamin D in patients undergoing OAGB-MGB bypass. Whether these findings will sustain in longer treatment duration remained to be elucidated in future studies.

390,How Sustained is Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Long-term Efficacy? : Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass efficacy.,"The rate of weight regain after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) can hamper the procedure long-term efficacy for obesity treatment and related comorbidities. To evaluate the rate of weight loss and comorbidity remission failure 10 years or more after RYGB surgery. Retrospective observational cohort study. Patients submitted to RYGB for obesity treatment at a single centre with 10 years or more after surgery underwent a clinical reassessment. Among the subjects invited for clinical revaluation (n = 585), only those who performed RYGB and attended the hospital visit were included in the study (n = 281). The pre-operative mean body mass index (BMI) was 44.4 Â± 6.1 kg/m2. Mean post-operative time was 12.2 Â± 1.1 years. After surgery, mean BMI was significantly lower 33.4 Â± 5.8 kg/m2 (p < 0.0001), 29.5% with a BMI < 30 kg/m2. Mean Total Weight Lost (%TWL) was 24.3 Â± 11.4%, reaching a %TWL â‰¥ 20% in 70.1% with a mean %TWL of 30.0 Â± 7.0%. Co-morbidities remission rate was 54.2% for type 2 diabetes, 34.1% for hypertension, 52.4% for hyperlipidemia and 50% for obstructive sleep apnea. Early complications rate was 13.2% and revision surgery occurred in 2.8% of patients. Four patients died of RYGB complications within the first 90 days after surgery. RYGB has a high rate of long-term successful weight loss and obesity-associated comorbidity improvement. Weight loss failure requiring revision surgery occurs in a small proportion of patients.

623,A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Effect of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass on Barrett's Esophagus.,"Obesity is associated with a twofold risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and thrice the risk of Barrett's esophagus (BE). Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) leads to weight loss and improvement of GERD in population with obesity, but its effect on BE is less clear. Bibliographic databases were searched systematically for relevant articles till January 31, 2019. Studies evaluating the effect of RYGB on BE with preoperative and postoperative endoscopy and biopsy were included. Study quality was assessed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) tool. Meta-analysis was conducted using Mantel-Haenszel, random effects model and presented as risk difference (RD) or odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals. Eight studies with 10,779 patients undergoing RYGB reported on 117 patients with BE with follow-up of >â€‰1Â year. Significant regression of BE after RYGB was observed (RD -â€‰0.56.95% c.i. -â€‰0.69 to -â€‰0.43; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Subgroup analysis showed regression of both short-segment BE [ssBE] (RD -â€‰0.51.95% c.i. -â€‰0.68 to -â€‰0.33; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and long-segment BE [lsBE] (RD -â€‰0.46.95% c.i. -â€‰0.71 to -â€‰0.21; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001).

1461,Laparoscopic gastric bypass for morbid obesity-a randomized controlled trial comparing two gastrojejunal anastomosis techniques.,"We present a randomized controlled trial of laparoscopic gastric bypass comparing 2 techniques of gastrojejunostomy in patients with morbid obesity. Eighty consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between September 2005 and August 2006. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups by the use of sealed envelopes. In group A, the gastrojejunal anastomosis was performed with a 21-mm circular-stapler, and in group B, this anastomosis was performed with a 45-mm linear-stapler. The rest of the procedure was identical in both groups. Variables evaluated were complications involving the gastrojejunostomy, operative time, length of stay, and percentage of excess weight loss. Both groups were similar in age and body mass index. No patients experienced leakage or gastrojejunal anastomosis fistula, but group A patients had a more frequent stricture rate (P<0.05). Operative time and hospital stay were comparable in both groups (P>0.05). Percentage excess weight loss at one year following surgery was satisfactory in both groups, without a statistically significant difference (P>0.05). Gastrojejunal anastomosis does not seem to be a critical factor in excess weight loss for morbidly obese patients who underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass. The 2 techniques used in this experience are safe and effective; however, the 45-mm liner-stapler is preferable because it has a lower stricture rate.",,0,,0,1625
132,"Patient-reported outcomes, weight loss, and remission of type 2 diabetes 3 years after gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy (Oseberg); a single-centre, randomised controlled trial.","Little is known about the comparative effects of various bariatric procedures on patient-reported outcomes. We aimed to compare 3-year effects of gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy on patient-reported outcome measures in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. The Oseberg trial was a single-centre, parallel-group, randomised trial at Vestfold Hospital Trust, a public tertiary obesity centre in TÃ¸nsberg, Norway. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with previously verified BMI 35Â·0 kg/m2 or greater. Diabetes was diagnosed if glycated haemoglobin was at least 6Â·5% (48 mmol/mol) or by their use of anti-diabetic medications with glycated haemoglobin at least 6Â·1% (43 mmol/mol). Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. All patients received identical preoperative and postoperative treatment. Randomisation was done with a computerised random number generator and a block size of ten. Study personnel, patients, and the primary outcome assessor were blinded to allocations for 1 year. The prespecified secondary outcomes reported here were 3-year changes in several clinically important patient-reported outcomes, weight loss, and diabetes remission. Analyses were done in the intention to treat population. This trial is ongoing, closed to recruitment and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01778738. Between Oct 15, 2012 and Sept 1, 2017, 319 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes scheduled for bariatric surgery were assessed for eligibility. 101 patients were not eligible (29 did not have type 2 diabetes according to inclusion criteria and 72 other exclusion criteria) and 93 declined to participate. 109 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to sleeve gastrectomy (n=55) or gastric bypass (n=54). 72 (66%) of 109 patients were female and 37 (34%) were male. 104 (95%) of patients were White. 16 patients were lost to follow up and 93 (85%) patients completed the 3-year follow-up. Three additional patients were contacted by phone for registration of comorbidities Compared with sleeve gastrectomy, gastric bypass was associated with a greater improvement in weight-related quality of life (between group difference 9Â·4, 95% CI 3Â·3 to 15Â·5), less reflux symptoms (0Â·54, 0Â·17 to -0Â·90), greater total bodyweight loss (8% difference, 25% vs 17%), and a higher probability of diabetes remission (67% vs 33%, risk ratio 2Â·00; 95% CI 1Â·27 to 3Â·14). Five patients reported postprandial hypoglycaemia in the third year after gastric bypass versus none after sleeve-gastrectomy (p=0Â·059). Symptoms of abdominal pain, indigestion, diarrhoea, dumping syndrome, depression, binge eating, and appetitive drive did not differ between groups. At 3 years, gastric bypass was superior to sleeve gastrectomy in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity regarding weight related quality of life, reflux symptoms, weight loss, and remission of diabetes, while symptoms of abdominal pain, indigestion, diarrhoea, dumping, depression and binge eating did not differ between groups. This new patient-reported knowledge can be used in the shared decision-making process to inform patients about similarities and differences between expected outcomes after the two surgical procedures.

650,EARLY WEIGHT LOSS OUTCOMES AND GLUCOSE METABOLISM PARAMETERS AFTER BANDED VERSUS NON-BANDED ONE ANASTOMOSIS GASTRIC BYPASS: A PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED TRIAL.,"The influence of the placement of a band on the outcomes of one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) has not been appropriately studied yet. To compare early weight loss and glucose metabolism parameters following banded versus non-banded OAGB. A prospective randomized study, which evaluated 20 morbidly obese individuals who underwent banded and non-banded OAGB and were followed-up for three months. Weight loss (percentage of excess weight loss - %EWL and percentage of body mass index loss - %BMIL) and glucose metabolism outcomes (glucose, insulin and homeostasis model assessment - HOMA) were compared. The banded group presented a significantly higher %EWL at one month (29.6Â±5.5% vs 17.2Â±3.4%; P<0.0001) and two months post-surgery (46Â±7% vs 34.2Â±9%; P=0.004544), as well as a significantly higher %BMIL at one month (9.7Â±1.1% vs 5.8Â±0.8%; P<0.0001), two months (15Â±1.4% vs 11.5Â±2.1; P=0.000248), and three months (18.8Â±1.8% vs 15.7Â±3.2%; P=0.016637). At three months, banded OAGB led to significant decreases of insulin (14.4Â±4.3 vs 7.6Â±1.9; P=0.00044) and HOMA (3.1Â±1.1 vs 1.5Â±0.4; P=0.00044), whereas non-banded OAGB also led to significant decreases of insulin (14.8Â±7.6 vs 7.8Â±3.1; P=0.006) and HOMA (3.2Â±1.9 vs 1.6Â±0.8; P=0.0041). The percent variation of HOMA did not significantly differ between banded and non-banded OAGB (P=0.62414); overall, the percent variation of HOMA was not correlated with %EWL (P=0.96988) or %BMIL (P=0.82299). Banded OAGB led to a higher early weight loss than the standard technique. Banded and non-banded OAGB led to improvements in insulin resistance regardless of weight loss.",10.1590/S0004-2803.201900000-14,0,,0,1627
167,Management of leaks following one-anastomosis gastric bypass: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of 44Â 318 patients.,"One-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) complication, such as leakage, can be dangerous and should be managed properly, yet little data exist in the literature regarding the management of leaks after OAGB, and there are no guidelines to date. The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature and 46 studies, examining 44Â 318 patients were included. There were 410 leaks reported in 44Â 318 patients of OAGB published in the literature, which represents a prevalence of 1% of leaks after OAGB. The surgical strategy was very variable among all the different studies; 62.1% of patients with leaks had to undergo another surgery due to the leak. The most commonly performed procedure was peritoneal washout and drainage (with or without T-tube placement) in 30.8% of patients, followed by conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in 9.6% of patients. Medical treatment with antibiotics, with or without total parenteral nutrition alone, was conducted in 13.6% of patients. Among the patients with the leak, the mortality rate related to the leak was 1.95%, and the mortality due to the leak in the population of OAGB was 0.02%. The management of leaks following OAGB requires a multidisciplinary approach. OAGB is a safe operation with a low leak risk rate, and the leaks can be managed successfully if detected in a timely fashion.",10.1097/JS9.0000000000000346,0,,0,1628
1580,Outcome of esophageal function and 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring after vertical banded gastroplasty and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"One of the co-morbidities frequently associated with morbid obesity is gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), present in >50 % of morbidly obese individuals. We compared the anti-reflux effect of vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP), and their effect on esophageal function. 10 patients underwent VBG and 40 patients underwent RYGBP. Anthropometric parameters, symptomatology of GERD, esophageal manometry (EM), isotopic esophageal emptying (IEE) and 24 hr esophageal pH monitoring were recorded in all patients preoperatively, and at 3 months and 1 year postoperatively. Preoperatively, there was a high prevalence of GERD, symptomatic and pH-metric in both groups (57% and 80% respectively). The preoperative values of EM and IEE parameters were within the normal range in most patients. After surgery, there was an improvement at 3 months postoperatively in both groups. 1 year after surgery, the VBG group presented symptomatic GERD in 30% and pH-metric reflux in 60% of patients while the RYGBP group presented symptomatic GERD and pH-metric reflux in 12.5% and 15% of patients, respectively. There was an increase in postoperative sensation of dysphagia in both groups (70% VBG, 30% RYGBP) one year after operation. After surgery, differences in all EM parameters were minimal, and never reached statistical significance for any group (VBG and RYGBP). The IEE showed a significantly higher percentage of esophageal retention after surgery, but this retention was always within the normal range. Both groups had an improvement in anthropometric parameters, but 1 year after surgery the results were significantly better in RYGBP patients (70% excess weight loss) than in VBG patients (46% excess weight loss). >50% of morbidly obese individuals suffer from GERD. We did not find changes in esophageal function of morbidly obese patients to explain their gastroesophageal reflux preoperatively and postoperatively. EM and IEE studies are not indicated as standard preoperative tests, except in patients with significant symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux. RYGBP is significantly better than VBG as an anti-reflux procedure, and had better weight loss.",10.1381/0960892041975497,0,,0,1629
21,"Banded versus non-banded Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: short, mid, and long-term surgical outcomes - a systematic review and meta-analysis.","The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is considered as one of the most effective treatments for people with obesity. A variant of this procedure, the banded-RYGB, may present several advantages over the standard technique. These potential benefits include enhanced weight loss, decreased recurrent weight gain, a lower incidence of dumping syndrome, and less distention of the jejunum below the gastrojejunostomy. The objective of this meta-analysis is to compare the surgical outcomes of RYGB procedures with a band (banded-RYGB) and without a band (RYGB) in the management of individuals with obesity. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and the Cochrane protocol (PROSPERO ID: CRD42023439874). The systematic review process led to the identification of 13 comparative studies involving 3230 patients who underwent banded-RYGB and 5302 who received RYGB, all of which were eligible for inclusion and meta-analysis. Four studies reported data on 1-year postoperative percent excess weight loss (%EWL), demonstrating a significant increase of 6.03 %EWL in patients who underwent banded-RYGB. Four studies reported the 2-year postoperative %EWL, showing that patients who had banded-RYGB experienced a 5.32 greater %EWL compared to those who received RYGB, even if this was not statistically significant. For 5-year %EWL after bariatric surgery, 5 studies were included for continuous outcome meta-analysis. The average 5-years %EWL difference was 7.6 in favor of banded-RYGB. Patients who had banded-RYGB presented a nonsignificant 1.45 OR of developing postoperative complications compared to patients receiving RYGB. This meta-analysis demonstrates that, compared to RYGB, patients who underwent banded-RYGB surgery showed a statistically significant increase in the %EWL at 1, 2, and 5 years postoperatively. Moreover, the banding procedure does not significantly increase the risk of postoperative complications.",10.1016/j.soard.2024.05.010,0,,0,1630
1486,Gastroesophageal reflux disease in morbid obesity: the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common condition in obesity. The impact of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) on GERD is poorly known. We studied the effect of the RYGBP on GERD in patients with morbid obesity (MO). Twenty consecutive patients with MO (BMI > 40 kg/m(2)) were studied before and 6 months after RYGBP. GERD symptoms were evaluated with Carlsson-Dent questionnaire (CDQ). All the patients underwent esophageal manometry and ambulatory 24-h pH-metry. Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables, and Wilcoxon test was used for numerical variables. A p value under 0.05 was considered significant. There were 16 women (80%) and 4 men (20%) with mean age 38.9 +/- 6.9 years included in this study. BMI was 48.5 +/- 6.2 kg/m(2) and 33.2 +/- 4.5 kg/m(2) before and after RYGBP, respectively. Mean weight reduction was 42.5 +/- 9.7 kg (p < 0.001).

866,Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus laparoscopic mini gastric bypass in the treatment of obesity: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is considered the gold standard in bariatric surgery, achieving durable long-term weight loss with improvement of obesity-related comorbidities. Lately, the laparoscopic mini gastric bypass (LMGB) has gained worldwide popularity with similar results to LRYGB in terms of weight loss and comorbidity resolution. However, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing LMGB and LRYGB. This article describes the design and protocol of a randomized controlled trial comparing the outcomes of these two bariatric procedures. The trial is designed as a single center, randomized, patient and observer blinded trial. The relevant ethics committee has approved the trial protocol. To demonstrate that LMGB is not inferior to LRYGB in terms of excess weight loss (EWL) the study is conducted as a non-inferiority trial with the sample-size calculations performed accordingly. EWL 12Â months after surgery is the primary endpoint, whereas 3-year EWL, morbidity, mortality, remission of obesity related comorbidities, quality of life (QOL) and hormonal and lipid profile changes are secondary endpoints. Eighty patients, 18Â years or older and with a body mass index (BMI) between 35 and 50Â kg/m2 who meet the Swiss guidelines for the surgical treatment of morbid obesity will be randomized. The endpoints and baseline measurements will be assessed pre-surgery, peri-surgery and post-surgery (fixed follow up measurements are at discharge and at the time points 6Â weeks and 12 and 36Â months postoperatively). With its 3-year follow up time, this RCT will provide important data on the impact of LMGB and LRYGB on EWL, remission of comorbidities, QOL and hormonal and lipid profile changes.

259,"Effect of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy vs Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass on Weight Loss, Comorbidities, and Reflux at 10 Years in Adult Patients With Obesity: The SLEEVEPASS Randomized Clinical Trial.","Long-term results from randomized clinical trials comparing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) with laparoscopic Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass (LRYGB) are limited. To compare long-term outcomes of weight loss and remission of obesity-related comorbidities and the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms (GERD), endoscopic esophagitis, and Barrett esophagus (BE) after LSG and LRYGB at 10 years. This 10-year observational follow-up evaluated patients in the Sleeve vs Bypass (SLEEVEPASS) multicenter equivalence randomized clinical trial comparing LSG and LRYGB in the treatment of severe obesity in which 240 patients aged 18 to 60 years with median body mass index of 44.6 were randomized to LSG (nâ€‰=â€‰121) or LRYGB (nâ€‰=â€‰119). The initial trial was conducted from April 2008 to June 2010 in Finland, with last follow-up on January 27, 2021. LSG or LRYGB. The primary end point was 5-year percentage excess weight loss (%EWL). This current analysis focused on 10-year outcomes with special reference to reflux and BE. At 10 years, of 240 randomized patients (121 randomized to LSG and 119 to LRYGB; 167 women [69.6%]; mean [SD] age, 48.4 [9.4] years; mean [SD] baseline BMI, 45.9 [6.0]), 2 never underwent surgery and there were 10 unrelated deaths; 193 of the remaining 228 patients (85%) completed follow-up on weight loss and comorbidities, and 176 of 228 (77%) underwent gastroscopy. Median (range) %EWL was 43.5% (2.1%-109.2%) after LSG and 50.7% (1.7%-111.7%) after LRYGB. Mean estimate %EWL was not equivalent between the procedures; %EWL was 8.4 (95% CI, 3.1-13.6) higher in LRYGB. After LSG and LRYGB, there was no statistically significant difference in type 2 diabetes remission (26% and 33%, respectively; Pâ€‰=â€‰.63), dyslipidemia (19% and 35%, respectively; Pâ€‰=â€‰.23), or obstructive sleep apnea (16% and 31%, respectively; Pâ€‰=â€‰.30). Hypertension remission was superior after LRYGB (8% vs 24%; Pâ€‰=â€‰.04). Esophagitis was more prevalent after LSG (31% vs 7%; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001) with no statistically significant difference in BE (4% vs 4%; Pâ€‰=â€‰.29). The overall reoperation rate was 15.7% for LSG and 18.5% for LRYGB (Pâ€‰=â€‰.57). At 10 years, %EWL was greater after LRYGB and the procedures were not equivalent for weight loss, but both LSG and LRYGB resulted in good and sustainable weight loss. Esophagitis was more prevalent after LSG, but the cumulative incidence of BE was markedly lower than in previous trials and similar after both procedures.

325,"30-day morbidity and mortality of sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and one anastomosis gastric bypass: a propensity score-matched analysis of the GENEVA data.","There is a paucity of data comparing 30-day morbidity and mortality of sleeve gastrectomy (SG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). This study aimed to compare the 30-day safety of SG, RYGB, and OAGB in propensity score-matched cohorts. This analysis utilised data collected from the GENEVA study which was a multicentre observational cohort study of bariatric and metabolic surgery (BMS) in 185 centres across 42 countries between 01/05/2022 and 31/10/2020 during the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. 30-day complications were categorised according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Patients receiving SG, RYGB, or OAGB were propensity-matched according to baseline characteristics and 30-day complications were compared between groups. In total, 6770 patients (SG 3983; OAGB 702; RYGB 2085) were included in this analysis. Prior to matching, RYGB was associated with highest 30-day complication rate (SG 5.8%; OAGB 7.5%; RYGB 8.0% (pâ€‰=â€‰0.006)). On multivariate regression modelling, Insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolaemia were associated with increased 30-day complications. Being a non-smoker was associated with reduced complication rates. When compared to SG as a reference category, RYGB, but not OAGB, was associated with an increased rate of 30-day complications. A total of 702 pairs of SG and OAGB were propensity score-matched. The complication rate in the SG group was 7.3% (nâ€‰=â€‰51) as compared to 7.5% (nâ€‰=â€‰53) in the OAGB group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.68). Similarly, 2085 pairs of SG and RYGB were propensity score-matched. The complication rate in the SG group was 6.1% (nâ€‰=â€‰127) as compared to 7.9% (nâ€‰=â€‰166) in the RYGB group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.09). And, 702 pairs of OAGB and RYGB were matched. The complication rate in both groups was the same at 7.5 % (nâ€‰=â€‰53; pâ€‰=â€‰0.07).

800,Effect of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy vs Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass on Weight Loss at 5 Years Among Patients With Morbid Obesity: The SLEEVEPASS Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for treatment of morbid obesity has increased substantially despite the lack of long-term results compared with laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. To determine whether laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass are equivalent for weight loss at 5 years in patients with morbid obesity. The Sleeve vs Bypass (SLEEVEPASS) multicenter, multisurgeon, open-label, randomized clinical equivalence trial was conducted from March 2008 until June 2010 in Finland. The trial enrolled 240 morbidly obese patients aged 18 to 60 years, who were randomly assigned to sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass with a 5-year follow-up period (last follow-up, October 14, 2015). Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (nâ€‰=â€‰121) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (nâ€‰=â€‰119). The primary end point was weight loss evaluated by percentage excess weight loss. Prespecified equivalence margins for the clinical significance of weight loss differences between gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy were -9% to +9% excess weight loss. Secondary end points included resolution of comorbidities, improvement of quality of life (QOL), all adverse events (overall morbidity), and mortality. Among 240 patients randomized (mean age, 48 [SD, 9] years; mean baseline body mass index, 45.9, [SD, 6.0]; 69.6% women), 80.4% completed the 5-year follow-up. At baseline, 42.1% had type 2 diabetes, 34.6% dyslipidemia, and 70.8% hypertension. The estimated mean percentage excess weight loss at 5 years was 49% (95% CI, 45%-52%) after sleeve gastrectomy and 57% (95% CI, 53%-61%) after gastric bypass (difference, 8.2 percentage units [95% CI, 3.2%-13.2%], higher in the gastric bypass group) and did not meet criteria for equivalence. Complete or partial remission of type 2 diabetes was seen in 37% (nâ€‰=â€‰15/41) after sleeve gastrectomy and in 45% (nâ€‰=â€‰18/40) after gastric bypass (Pâ€‰>â€‰.99). Medication for dyslipidemia was discontinued in 47% (nâ€‰=â€‰14/30) after sleeve gastrectomy and 60% (nâ€‰=â€‰24/40) after gastric bypass (Pâ€‰=â€‰.15) and for hypertension in 29% (nâ€‰=â€‰20/68) and 51% (nâ€‰=â€‰37/73) (Pâ€‰=â€‰.02), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in QOL between groups (Pâ€‰=â€‰.85) and no treatment-related mortality. At 5 years the overall morbidity rate was 19% (nâ€‰=â€‰23) for sleeve gastrectomy and 26% (nâ€‰=â€‰31) for gastric bypass (Pâ€‰=â€‰.19). Among patients with morbid obesity, use of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy compared with use of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass did not meet criteria for equivalence in terms of percentage excess weight loss at 5 years. Although gastric bypass compared with sleeve gastrectomy was associated with greater percentage excess weight loss at 5 years, the difference was not statistically significant, based on the prespecified equivalence margins. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00793143.",10.1001/jama.2017.20313,0,,0,1635

A systematic review revealed a similar excess weight loss (EWL) 2 years postoperatively between SG and RYGB. However, there is a lack of randomized controlled multi-centre trials comparing SG and RYGB, not only concerning EWL, but also in terms of remission of obesity-related co-morbidities, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and quality of life (QoL) in the mid- and long-term. The BariSurg trial was designed as a multi-centre, randomized controlled patient and observer blind trial. The trial protocol was approved by the corresponding ethics committees of the centres. To demonstrate EWL non-inferiority of SG compared to RYGB, power calculation was performed according to a non-inferiority study design. Morbidity, mortality, remission of obesity-related co-morbidities, GERD course and QoL are major secondary endpoints. 248 patients between 18 and 70 years, with a body mass index (BMI) between 35-60 kg/m(2) and indication for bariatric surgery according to the most recent German S3-guidelines will be randomized. The primary and secondary endpoints will be assessed prior to surgery and afterwards at discharge and at the time points 3-6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months postoperatively. With its five year follow-up, the BariSurg-trial will provide further evidence based data concerning the impact of SG and RYGB on EWL, remission of obesity-related co-morbidities, the course of GERD and QoL.

561,Metabolic effects and outcomes of sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass: a cohort study.,"The outcomes of bariatric surgery should not be evaluated only for weight loss purposes but from a wider point of view that is closer to the reality of morbidly obese patients. The study of the influence of bariatric surgery over obesity-related diseases in bariatric patients is worthwhile. We present a cohort study of 329 patients who underwent either laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG: 165 patients) or laparoscopic gastric bypass (LRYGBP: 164). We analyzed complication rate, comorbidities and weight loss evolution. Both groups were comparable in demographic characteristics at baseline. Significant statistical differences were found in length of hospital stay and operative time (both were lower in the LSG group). Bleeding and wound infection were higher in the LRYGBP group, as it happened with intestinal occlusion as a late complication (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). After a 5-year follow-up, the percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) was higher in gastric bypass than sleeve gastrectomy (pâ€‰=â€‰0.01) but there was no statistical difference in percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) (pâ€‰=â€‰0.2). The resolution of comorbidities was similar in both groups except for dyslipidemia, which resolution was significantly higher in the gastric bypass group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.005). Metabolic syndrome (MeTS) resolution was similar in both groups. Sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass achieve similar outcomes in hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea and MeTS resolution even when there is weight regain. Although gastric bypass achieves higher weight loss in morbid obese patients, complication rates are also higher compared to those of sleeve gastrectomy. Thus, the appropriate procedure should be tailored based on patient factors and comorbidities, but also on surgeon comfort level and experience.",10.1007/s00464-019-07355-z,0,,0,1637

To compare the evolution of estimated renal function observed 1 year after OAGB and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in individuals with obesity. Observational, analytical, and retrospective cohort study. Tertiary-level university hospital. This study used a prospectively collected database of individuals who consecutively underwent bariatric surgery. Renal function was assessed by calculating the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration. The one-year variation in the eGFR was compared between the procedures. No significant differences in age, sex, obesity-associated conditions, or body mass index were observed among individuals who underwent either OAGB or RYGB. OAGB led to a significantly higher percentage of total (P = 0.007) and excess weight loss (P = 0.026). Both OAGB and RYGB led to significantly higher values of eGFR (103.9 Â± 22 versus 116.1 Â± 13.3; P = 0.007, and 102.4 Â± 19 versus 113.2 Â± 13.3; P < 0.001, respectively). The one-year variation in eGFR was 11 Â± 16.2% after OAGB and 16.7 Â± 26.3% after RYGB (P = 0.3). Younger age and lower baseline eGFR were independently associated with greater postoperative improvement in renal function (P < 0.001). Compared with RYGB, OAGB led to an equivalent improvement in renal function 1 year after the procedure, along with greater weight loss.",10.1590/1516-3180.2023.0161.R1.08022024,0,,0,1639
1441,"A prospective randomized trial of laparoscopic gastric bypass versus laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding for the treatment of morbid obesity: outcomes, quality of life, and costs.","Gastric bypass and adjustable gastric banding are the 2 most commonly performed bariatric procedures for the treatment of morbid obesity. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes, quality of life, and costs of laparoscopic gastric bypass versus laparoscopic gastric banding. Between 2002 and 2007, 250 patients with a body mass index of 35 to 60 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to gastric bypass or gastric banding. After exclusion, 111 patients underwent gastric bypass and 86 patients underwent gastric banding. Outcome measures included demographic data, operative time, blood loss, length of hospital stay, morbidity, mortality, early and late reoperation rate, weight loss, changes in quality of life, and cost. Treatment failure was defined as losing less than 20% of excess weight or conversion to another bariatric operation for failure of weight loss. There were no deaths at 90 days in either group. The mean body mass index was higher in the gastric bypass group (47.5 vs. 45.5 kg/m2, respectively, P < 0.01) while the mean age was higher in the gastric band group (45 vs. 41 years, respectively, P < 0.01). Compared with gastric banding, operative blood loss was higher and the mean operative time and length of stay were longer in the gastric bypass group. The 30-day complication rate was higher after gastric bypass (21.6% vs. 7.0% for gastric band); however, there were no life-threatening complications such as leaks or sepsis. The most frequent late complication in the gastric bypass group was stricture (14.3%). The 1-year mortality was 0.9% for the gastric bypass group and 0% for the gastric band group. The percent of excess weight loss at 4 years was higher in the gastric bypass group (68 Â± 19% vs. 45 Â± 28%, respectively, P < 0.05). Treatment failure occurred in 16.7% of the patients who underwent gastric banding and in 0% of those who underwent gastric bypass, with male gender being a predictive factor for poor weight loss after gastric banding. At 1-year postsurgery, quality of life improved in both groups to that of US norms. The total cost was higher for gastric bypass as compared with gastric banding procedure ($12,310 vs. $10,766, respectively, P < 0.01). Laparoscopic gastric bypass and gastric banding are both safe and effective approaches for the treatment of morbid obesity. Gastric bypass resulted in better weight loss at medium- and long-term follow-up but was associated with more perioperative and late complications and a higher 30-day readmission rate. There was a wide variation in weight loss after gastric banding with a small proportion of patients considered as treatment failure, and male gender was a predictive factor for poor weight loss.",10.1097/SLA.0b013e3181b92480,0,,0,1640
992,Revision of Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass for Weight Regain: a Systematic Review of Techniques and Outcomes.,"Weight regain has led to an increase in revision of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgeries. There is no standardized approach to revisional surgery after failed RYGB. We performed an exhaustive literature search to elucidate surgical revision options. Our objective was to evaluate outcomes and complications of various methods of revision after RYGB to identify the option with the best outcomes for failed primary RYGB. A systematic literature search was conducted using the following search tools and databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Clinical Trials Database, Cochrane Review Database, EMBASE, and Allied and Complementary Medicine to identify all relevant studies describing revision after failed RYGB. Inclusion criteria comprised of revisional surgery for weight gain after RYGB. Of the 1200 articles found, only 799 were selected for our study. Of the 799, 24 studies, with a total of 866 patients, were included for a systematic review. Of the 24 studies, 5 were conversion to Distal Roux-en-y gastric bypass (DRYGB), 5 were revision of gastric pouch and anastomosis, 6 were revision with gastric band, 2 were revision to biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal switch (BPD/DS), and 6 were revision to endoluminal procedures (i.e., stomaphyx). Mean percent excess body mass index loss (%EBMIL) after revision up to 1 and 3-year follow-up for BPD/DS was 63.7 and 76Â %, DRYGB was 54 and 52.2Â %, gastric banding revision 47.6 and 47.3Â %, gastric pouch/anastomosis revision 43.3 and 14Â %, and endoluminal procedures at 32.1Â %, respectively. Gastric pouch/anastomosis revision resulted in the lowest major complication rate at 3.5Â % and DRYGB with the highest at 11.9Â % when compared to the other revisional procedures. The mortality rate was 0.6Â % which only occurred in the DRYGB group. All 866 patients in the 24 studies reported significant early initial weight loss after revision for failed RYGB. However, of the five surgical revision options considered, BPD/DS, DRYGB, and gastric banding resulted in sustained weight loss, with acceptable complication rate.",10.1007/s11695-016-2201-5,0,,0,1641
505,The Role of Ursodeoxycholic Acid (UDCA) in Cholelithiasis Management After One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB) for Morbid Obesity: Results of a Monocentric Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Bariatric surgery leads to rapid weight loss, a well-known risk factor for gallstone formation. Postoperative biliary complication rate requiring cholecystectomy is between 0.9 and 7.5% after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and between 6 and 50% after laparoscopic gastric bypass. Several authors recommended ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) administration to reduce gallstone formation after diet-induced weight reduction. The aim of this randomized monocentric study is to evaluate gallstone incidence after prophylactic administration of UDCA in patients undergoing one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). Patients undergoing OAGB were prospectively randomized into 2 groups: the UDCA group receiving oral UDCA 600Â mg/days for 6Â months in the immediate postoperative days, and the control group not administered with UDCA. Each group included 95 patients. Abdominal ultrasound, clinical evaluation, and quality of life scoring with Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) were performed postoperatively in all patients at 3, 6, and 12Â months. At 12Â months of postoperative follow-up, 4 (4.2%) and 24 patients (25.2%) showed gallstones in the UDCA group and control group, respectively (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Among those who developed gallstones, 8 (28.6%) cases were symptomatic whereas 20 (71.4%) did not show any symptom. No statistically significant difference in GIQLI score between the two groups was found. OAGB, as other malabsorbent procedures, appears to have higher rate of cholelithiasis than purely restrictive procedures. In our prospective randomized controlled study, a regular postoperative UDCA intake during the first 6Â months seems to significantly reduce cholelithiasis incidence after OAGB, with no case of intolerance reported. Further studies are needed to assess this issue.",10.1007/s11695-020-04801-z,0,,0,1642

The aim of this study was to expand long-term outcomes of patients undergoing RYGB after failed fundoplication and assess symptom resolution. A single institution prospective study was performed of patients undergoing fundoplication takedown and RYGB between March 2007 and September 2016. Demographics, body mass index (BMI), preoperative symptoms, operative duration and findings, and postoperative outcomes were recorded. Data were assessed using standard statistical methods. 87 patients with failed antireflux surgery underwent RYGB. Median age 58Â years (range 25-79Â years). Median preoperative BMI 32.4Â kg/m2 (range 21.6-50.6Â kg/m2). Comorbidities included hypertension (48.3%) and diabetes (11.5%). Sixty-six patients had undergone 1 prior fundoplication, 18 had 2 prior fundoplications, and 3 had 3 prior fundoplications. At least one previous open antireflux procedure had been performed in 16.1% of patients. The most common recurrent symptoms were reflux (85.1%), dysphagia (36.7%), pain (35.6%), and regurgitation (29.9%). Median symptom-free interval from last antireflux surgery was 3Â years (range 0-25Â years). RYGB was performed laparoscopically in 47.1% of cases, robotically in 44.8% of cases, and open in 5.9%. Operative duration was longer in the robotic group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.04). During RYGB, 85.1% patients were found to have an associated hiatal hernia, 34.5% had intrathoracic migration of the fundoplication, 32.2% a slipped fundoplication onto proximal stomach, and 13.8% had wrap disruption. Median length of stay (LOS) was 4Â days (range 1-33Â days). Median follow-up was 35.8 months, 11 patients (12.6%) had recurrent reflux symptoms. Excess body weight loss (%EWL) was 80.4%. There was no mortality but 8 patients required reoperation during follow-up. Fundoplication takedown with RYGB was successful for long-term reflux resolution.

747,Comparison of metabolic outcomes in patients undergoing laparoscopic roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus sleeve gastrectomy - a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.,"Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for morbid obesity and is known to have beneficial effects on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and in diabetes prevention. The preferred type of surgery and mechanism of action is, however, unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of laparoscopic roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) with those of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) on metabolic outcome, with a special focus on glycaemic control. A literature search of the Medline, Pubmed, Cochrane, Embase and SCOPUS databases was performed in November 2014 for RCTs comparing RYGB with SG in overweight and obese patients with or without T2DM. The primary outcome was improvement in postoperative glycaemic control. Secondary outcomes included weight-related and lipid metabolism parameters. Synthesis of these data followed established statistical procedures for meta-analysis. Sixteen RCTs with a total of 1132 patients with overweight or obesity were included in the analysis. When compared with patients who underwent SG, those who underwent RYGB showed no difference after 12 months in mean fasting blood glucose (mean difference [MD] -6.22 mg/dl, 95% confidence interval [CI] -17.27 to 4.83; p <0.001). However, there was a better outcome with RYGB, with lower mean fasting glucose levels at 24 months (MD -16.92 mg/dl, 95% CI -21.67 to -12.18), 36 months (MD -5.97mg/dl, 95% CI -9.32 to -2.62) and at 52 months (MD -15.20 mg/dl, 95% CI -27.35 to -3.05) mg/dl; p = 0.010) and lower mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA1 at 12 months (MD -0.47%, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.20%; p <0.001) and at 36 months postoperatively compared to SG. Fasting insulin levels and HOMA indices showed no difference at any stage of follow-up. In the subgroup including only diabetic patients HbA1c showed lower levels at 12 months (MD -0.46%, 95% CI-0.73 to -0.20%). No difference was found for the fasting insulin at baseline and after 12 months. Similarly, when compared to SG, patients that underwent RYGB had lower low-density lipoproteins at 12 months. This effect was lost at 36 months. Patients undergoing RYGB also had lower triglycerides at 12 months and at 52 months, lower cholesterol at 60 months and an improvement of BMI at 52 months postoperatively. BMI values at 12 months and low-density lipoprotein levels at 12 and 36 months were lower for diabetic patients only, as in the overall analysis. Based on this meta-analysis, RYGB is more effective than SG in improving weight loss and short- and mid-term glycaemic and lipid metabolism control in patients with and without T2DM. Therefore, unless contraindicated, RYGB should be the first choice to treat patients with obesity and T2DM and/or dyslipidaemia.",10.57187/smw.2018.14633,0,,0,1645
844,Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass in Type 2 Diabetes Patients with Mild Obesity: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of only Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and body mass index (BMI) of 30-40Â kg/m2. A literature search was performed on MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL. The searches were performed in February 2017. English was the target language of the publications. The PICO question was used to determine eligibility for studies to be included: population, patient with BMI 30-40Â kg/m2; intervention, RYGB; comparison, control group with medical care alone; and outcome, metabolic outcomes. Only randomized clinical trials (RCT) were selected. The main outcome was T2D remission. Secondary outcomes were metabolic effect of RYGB, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia. A total of five RCTs were included. The studies included a larger proportion of women, and the average time of T2D duration ranged between 6 and 10Â years with 43.3% of the patients having a BMI below 35Â kg/m2. Despite randomization, the baseline demographics such as age, HbA1c, and duration of diabetes were often less favorable in the surgical group. At the longest follow-up, RYGB significantly improves total and partial type 2 remission, OR 17.48 (95% CI 4.28-71.35) and OR 20.71 (95% CI 5.16-83.12), respectively. HbA1c also reduces at longest follow-up in the surgery group (-Â 1.83 (95% CI -Â 2.14; -Â 1.51)). All these three outcomes revealed high level of evidence according to GRADE evaluation. There is already strong evidence that RYGB improves metabolic outcomes for at least 5Â years in patients with class I obesity.",10.1007/s11695-017-2869-1,0,,0,1646
268,Banded versus non-banded sleeve gastrectomy in obese patients: A systematic review & meta-analysis.,"Weight regain represents an important issue after sleeve gastrectomy (SG), hence banded sleeve gastrectomy (BSG) was proposed. Aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the performance ofBSG versus SG in obese patients. We searched the PubMed/Medline and Embase database through October 2020 and identified 6 studies, of which 2 randomized-controlled trials (recruiting673 patients). The primary outcome was % excess weight loss (%EWL); secondary outcomes included % total weight loss (%TWL), HbA1c improvement, overall complication and major complication rate, gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD)occurrence. We performed pairwise meta-analysis through a random effects model and expressed data as standardized mean difference (SMD) or odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). A sharp decline in %EWL at 1 year was observed with both treatments with no significant difference (SMD 5.99, -1.17 to 13.16), whereas a clear benefit with BSG over SG was observed over time (SMD 15.95, 13.31 to 18.58Â at 2 years; 18.37, 13.31 to 23.42Â at 3 years; 24.75, 22.38 to 27.12Â at 4 years; 29.85, 27.22 to 32.49Â at 5 years). Meta-regression did not find any significant correlations between age, sex, and baseline BMI with %EWL. Similarly, no difference in terms of %TWL was observed at 1 year (SMD 1, -3.31 to 5.30), whereas the magnitude of the benefit with BSG increased significantly from the second year onwards (SMD 5.99, 3.7 to 8.27Â at 2 year, 6.86, 5.13 to 8.59Â at 3 year, and 9.36, 7.07 to 11.65Â at 5 year). No difference in terms of HbA1c improvement was observed (SMD 0.40, -0.64 to 1.43). No difference in overall complication (OR 1.44, 0.55-3.76), major complications (OR 1.14, 0.52-1.87), and incidence of GERD was observed (OR 1.06, 0.56-2). BSG is superior to SG in obese patients, due to its ability to significantly increase %EWL with no additional safety issues.",10.1016/j.amjsurg.2022.05.015,0,,0,1647
270,Postoperative morbidity and weight loss after revisional bariatric surgery for primary failed restrictive procedure: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"revisional bariatric surgery is gaining increasing interest as long term follow-up studies demonstrate an elevated failure rate of primary surgery due to insufficient weight loss, weight regain or complications. This particularly concerns restrictive bariatric surgery which has been widely adopted from the '80s till present through different procedures, notably vertical banded gastroplasty, laparoscopic adjusted gastric banding and sleeve gastrectomy. The aim of this study is to define which revisional bariatric procedure performs the best after failure of primary restrictive surgery. a systematic review and network meta-analysis of 39 studies was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines and the Cochrane protocol. biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch guarantees the best results in terms of weight loss (1 and 3-years %TWL MD: 12.38 and 28.42) followed by single-anastomosis duodenoileal bypass (9.24 and 19.13), one-anastomosis gastric bypass (7.16 and 13.1), and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (4.68 and 7.3) compared to re-sleeve gastrectomy. Duodenal switch and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass are associated to an increased risk of late major morbidity (OR: 3.07 and 2.11 respectively) compared to re-sleeve gastrectomy while no significant difference was highlighted for the other procedures. Re-sleeve gastrectomy is the revisional intervention most frequently burdened by weight recidivism; compared to it, patients undergoing single-anastomosis duodenoileal bypass have the lowest risk of weight regain (OR: 0.07). considering the analyzed outcomes altogether, single-anastomosis duodenoileal bypass and one-anastomosis gastric bypass are the most performing revisional procedures after failure of restrictive surgery due to satisfying short and mid-term weight loss and low early and late morbidity. Moreover, single-anastomosis duodenoileal bypass has low risk of weight recidivism.",10.1016/j.ijsu.2022.106677,0,,0,1648
1228,Early results of the Swiss Multicentre Bypass or Sleeve Study (SM-BOSS): a prospective randomized trial comparing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.,"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has been proposed as an effective alternative to the current standard procedure, laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). Prospective data comparing both procedures are rare. Therefore, we performed a randomized clinical trial assessing the effectiveness and safety of these 2 operative techniques. Two hundred seventeen patients were randomized at 4 bariatric centers in Switzerland. One hundred seven patients underwent LSG using a 35-F bougie with suturing of the stapler line, and 110 patients underwent LRYGB with a 150-cm antecolic alimentary and a 50-cm biliopancreatic limb. The mean body mass index of all patients was 44 Â± 11.1 kg/m, the mean age was 43 Â± 5.3 years, and 72% were female. The 2 groups were similar in terms of body mass index, age, sex, comorbidities, and eating behavior. The mean operative time was less for LSG than for LRYGB (87 Â± 52.3 minutes vs 108 Â± 42.3 minutes; P = 0.003). The conversion rate was 0.9% in both groups. Complications (<30 days) occurred more often in LRYGB than in LSG (17.2% vs 8.4%; P = 0.067). However, the difference in severe complications did not reach statistical significance (4.5% for LRYGB vs 1% for LSG; P = 0.21). Excessive body mass index loss 1 year after the operation was similar between the 2 groups (72.3% Â± 22% for LSG and 76.6% Â± 21% for LRYGB; P = 0.2). Except for gastroesophageal reflux disease, which showed a higher resolution rate after LRYGB, the comorbidities and quality of life were significantly improved after both procedures. LSG was associated with shorter operation time and a trend toward fewer complications than with LRYGB. Both procedures were almost equally efficient regarding weight loss, improvement of comorbidities, and quality of life 1 year after surgery. Long-term follow-up data are needed to confirm these facts.",10.1097/SLA.0b013e3182a67426,0,,0,1649
714,Effectiveness and Safety of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in Elderly Patients-Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"As the population ages, there is more interest in bariatric surgery for older patients. There are controversies regarding the safety and effectiveness of surgical weight loss in this population. The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in patients over the age of 60Â years with younger patients. The available literature was searched for eligible studies up to February 2018. Inclusion criteria were reports on mortality, morbidity, percentage excess weight loss (%EWL), remission of diabetes, remission of hypertension, and remission of obstructive sleep apnea. Random effects meta-analyses were performed. The initial search yielded 2000 references. The final meta-analysis involved nine studies and revealed significant differences in mortality (odds ratio 4.38, 95% confidence interval [1.25, 15.31], pâ€‰=â€‰0.02), morbidity (OR 1.88, CI [1.07, 3.30], pâ€‰=â€‰0.03), %EWL (mean difference -â€‰5.86, 95% CI [-â€‰9.15, -â€‰2.56], pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and remission of comorbidities. Higher mortality and morbidity were found in the group of older patients. The analysis suggested lower effectiveness of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for weight loss and improvement in comorbidity in older patients when compared with younger patients.",10.1007/s11695-018-3546-8,0,,0,1650
200,"Weight loss specific to indication, remission of diabetes, and short-term complications after sleeve gastrectomy conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is the most frequently performed bariatric procedure worldwide. Long-term complications such as insufficient weight loss (IWL) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may necessitate SG conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The aim of this review was to determine the indication-specific weight loss and diabetes remission after SG conversion to RYGB (STOBY). Our objective was to extract all available published data on indication for conversion, weight loss, remission of diabetes, and short-term complications after STOBY. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify studies reporting outcomes following STOBY. A random effects model was used for meta-analysis. The search identified 44 relevant studies. Overall short-term (12-mo) excess weight loss (EWL) was 54.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 46%-63%) in 23 studies (n = 712) and total weight loss (TWL) was 19.9% (95% CI, 14%-25%) in 21 studies (n = 740). For IWL, short-term (12-mo) pooled weight loss outcomes were 53.9% EWL (95% CI, 48%-59%) in 14 studies (n = 295) and 22.7% TWL (95% CI, 17%-28%) in 12 studies (n = 219), and medium-term (2-5 yr) outcomes were 45.8% EWL (95% CI, 38%-53%) in 7 studies (n = 154) and 20.6% TWL (95% CI, 15%-26%) in 9 studies (n = 206). Overall diabetes remission was 53% (95% CI, 33%-72%), and the perioperative complication rate was 8.2% (95% CI, 7.6%-8.7%). Revisional SG conversion to RYGB for IWL can achieve goodÂ weight loss outcomes and diabetes remission.",10.1016/j.soard.2022.11.004,0,,0,1651
537,Comparison of the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy on remission of type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. This study aims to compare the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) on remission of T2DM. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for studies published between database inception and 21 November 2019. A meta-analysis, using a random effects model, was performed to calculate relative risk (RR) of T2DM remission between the groups in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Of 2650 records identified, 12 records from 10 different RCTs were finally included. The studies comprised 705 patients with follow-up from 1 to 5 years. The remission rate of T2DM at 1 year was higher among those undergoing RYGB (156/276, 57%) compared with those undergoing SG (128/275, 47%), RR (95% CI) 1.20 (1.00-1.45), P = .047, I2 = 24.9%, moderate-quality evidence. Among studies with 2- to 5-year follow-up, there was no difference in remission rates between the RYGB (132/263, 50%) and SG (121/266, 46%) groups, RR 1.06 (0.94-1.20), P = .34, I2 = 0.0%, low-quality evidence. RYGB resulted in a higher rate of T2DM remission compared with SG after 1 year. The T2DM remission rates did not differ in studies with 2- to 5-year follow-up.",10.1111/obr.13011,0,,0,1652
671,Mid-long-term Revisional Surgery After Sleeve Gastrectomy: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"This study aimed to make a meta-analysis regarding mid-long-term outcomes (â‰¥â€‰3-year follow-up) after sleeve gastrectomy (SG), focusing on incidence, reasons, and results of revisional surgery. PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched and 32 studies were included. The overall revision rate was 10.4%, but for patients with â‰¥â€‰10-year follow-up, the rate was 22.6%. European studies had a higher revision rate (14.4%) than other studies. The most common reason for revision was failure in weight loss, and the most frequent revisional procedure was gastric bypass. Revisional surgery was favorable for weight reduction and comorbidity resolution. In conclusion, revision rate is not rare after SG, especially when looking at long-term follow-up.

639,One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass-Mini Gastric Bypass with Tailored Biliopancreatic Limb Length Formula Relative to Small Bowel Length: Preliminary Results.,"One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass-Mini Gastric Bypass (OAGB-MGB) is rapidly gaining popularity and is currently being performed by an increasing number of bariatric surgeons worldwide. However, excessive postoperative weight loss and malnutrition still remain a major concern regarding this procedure. The aim of this observational retrospective study was to investigate whether a tailored biliopancreatic limb (BPL) length relative to small bowel length (SBL) is superior to a fixed BPL length of 200Â cm in terms of weight loss results and nutritional deficiencies in morbidly obese patients 1Â year following OAGB-MGB. Sixty-four patients who underwent OAGB-MGB were divided into two consecutive groups depending on the BPL length used: fixed 200-cm BPL and tailored BPL groups. Anthropometric measurements (%EWL, TWL, %TWL) and nutritional parameters (vitamin A, vitamin D3, vitamin B12, serum iron, serum albumin, total protein) were compared between the two groups at 1-year follow-up. No statistically significant differences were observed between the patients in two groups in terms of %EWL, TWL, %TWL. The number of patients with deficiencies of vitamin A (pâ€‰=â€‰0.030), vitamin D3 (pâ€‰=â€‰0.020), and albumin (pâ€‰=â€‰0.030) was significantly higher in fixed 200-cm BPL group as compared with tailored BPL group, 1Â year following OAGB-MGB. No statistically significant differences were seen between the patients in two groups in terms of vitamin B12, iron, and total protein deficiencies. Tailoring BPL length by bypassing about 40% of the SBL seems to be safe and effective. According to preliminary results of this study, a tailored BPL length relative to SBL is even likely to be superior to the fixed 200-cm BPL as it is associated with less nutritional deficiencies while providing similar weight loss results. Further randomized studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are necessary to confirm the primary results of this study.",10.1007/s11695-019-04019-8,0,,0,1654
547,The Nissen-Sleeve (N-Sleeve): Results of a Cohort Study.,"The Montpellier bariatric team has recently proposed some technical alternatives to decrease the rate of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) after bariatric surgery and also to offer patients an alternative in case of contraindication to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP): the Nissen-Sleeve (N-Sleeve). We present here the results from a cohort of patients that underwent an operation with this newly designed anti-reflux bariatric procedure N-Sleeve: Nissen valve added to a standard SG. Data from a prospective, observational, and monocentric cohort. All consecutive patients presenting to the bariatric surgery department for a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy between 2016 and 2018 with GERD were included in the study. The fundus was stapled with a margin from the valve, and the valve was created with tissue at a distance from the greater curvature so as to avoid a double layer stapling of the stomach. A total of 70 patients were included in the study. Ninety percent of the cohort presented with a hiatal hernia at the time of surgery. No mortality was observed during the follow-up period. Concerning GERD, 76% of all patients had preoperative esophageal syndromes, whereas 21% were asymptomatic with associated esophagitis. Grade A-C esophagitis was present in 99% of the cohort, but no Barrett's esophagus was present. Fifty-six (80%) patients used PPIs regularly. At 1Â year of follow-up, one patient was still symptomatic. Comparative trials remain necessary between N-Sleeve and standard bariatric procedures to refine the specific indications of each of them and determine the eventual role of the N-Sleeve.",10.1007/s11695-020-04469-5,0,,0,1655
525,The effect of stoma size on the mid-term weight loss outcome of one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB): a single-blinded prospective randomized trial.,"One anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is gaining wide spread acceptance among bariatric surgeons all over the world because of its technical simplicity and documented efficacy. However, the relation between stoma size in OAGB and magnitude of weight loss has not been addressed. To evaluate the effect of stoma size on the mid-term weight loss outcome for patients with obesity after OAGB. University Hospital. This is a single-blinded prospectively randomized trial. From March 2014 to September 2016, 83 patients, eligible for bariatric surgery, were included in the study. OAGB was carried out with the same technical steps, except for the size of the gastrojejunostomy (GJ). Patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups; narrow GJ group (30Â mm) and wide GJ group (45Â mm). The percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) and the percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) were recorded at 6, 12 and 24Â months after procedure. At 6Â months follow-up, patients with 30Â mm GJ had better %EWL (53.3) and %TWL (23.4) than other patients with 45Â mm GJ (42.6 and 18.2 respectively). However, at 12 and 24Â months the %TWL and %EWL difference between the two groups have disappeared. Patients with narrower stoma size (30Â mm) of OAGB tend initially to lose more weight than patients with wider stoma (45Â mm). However, this difference disappears at mid-term follow-up after 2Â years.",10.1007/s00464-020-07553-0,0,,0,1656
272,Linear Versus Circular Laparoscopic Gastrojejunal Anastomosis of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 22 Comparative Studies.,"To compare the rate of complications of linear versus circular gastrojejunal anastomosis of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases was carried out using the terms ""laparoscopic,"" ""circular,"" ""linear,"" ""anastomosis,"" ""gastric bypass"" in accordance to PRISMA guidelines. Only original articles in English language comparing linear versus circular anastomosis were included. No temporal interval was set. Outcome measures were wound infection, bleeding, marginal ulcer, leak, and stricture. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. Funnel plots were used to detect publication bias. Twenty-two articles (7 prospective and 15 retrospective) out of 184 retrieved papers were included in this study. The pooled analysis showed a reduced odd of wound infection and bleeding after linear anastomosis. Likelihood of marginal ulcer, leak, and stricture was similar after the 2 techniques. Wound infection was reported in 15 studies (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.06-0.45; P=0.0003; I2=91), bleeding in 9 (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.34-0.59; P=0.00001; I2=6) marginal ulcer in 11 (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.26-1.41; P=0.25; I2=65), leaks in 15 (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.21-1.67; P=0.34; I2=83) and stricture in 18 (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.23-1.00; P=0.05; I2=68). Laparoscopic RYGB can be safely performed both with circular and linear staplers.

293,Reoperative bariatric surgery after primary laparoscopic gastric plication for morbid obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Laparoscopic gastric plication (LGP) often requires reoperative bariatric surgery (RBS) due to complications and insufficient weight loss. The aim of our study was to assess perioperative morbidity and weight loss during follow-up in patients undergoing RBS after primary LGP for morbid obesity. A search of PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines using (""conversion""OR ""revision*""""OR ""reoperat*"")AND(""gastric""OR ""curvatur*"")AND ""plication."" Studies were deemed eligible if data on RBS after LGP were provided. For each study, data were extracted and analyzed. In the literature review, 291 articles were screened and 7 included. The studies covered a total of 367 patients, of whom 119 received a sleeve gastrectomy (SG), 85 a Roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB), 75 a one anastomosis-gastric bypass (OAGB), 45 a re-LGP, and 25 a jejuno-ileal bypass. After RBS, excess weight loss was 50.8â€‰Â±â€‰6.5% at 6Â months, 71.0â€‰Â±â€‰7.7% at 12Â months, and 89.0â€‰Â±â€‰7.8% at 24Â months. Operative time was 101.3â€‰Â±â€‰14.6Â min. Postoperatively, 18/255 patients (7.1%) had a complication, and leakage and reoperations were reported in 6/255 (2.4%) and 5/255 (2.0%) patients, respectively. Length of hospital stay was 3.1â€‰Â±â€‰2.4Â days. The quality of evidence was rated as ""very low."" Despite limitations, this systematic review and meta-analysis showed that RBS after LGP has an acceptable rate of complications and is effective in terms of excess weight loss during follow-up. No specific operation (e.g., SG, RYGB, OAGB) can be suggested over another due to the lack of evidence.",10.1007/s00423-022-02485-w,0,,0,1658
522,Short-Term Changes on Body Composition and Bone Mass After One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass: a Prospective Observational Study.,"Bariatric surgery generates a large weight loss. It is considered a successful surgery when 50% of the excess weight loss is reached. However, this measure does not include some variables that may have a direct impact on a patient's health, such as fat-free mass (FFM) or bone mass. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate body composition and bone mass in patients undergoing one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). A prospective observational study was performed in patients undergoing OAGB. Body composition and bone mass were evaluated by bioelectrical impedance analysis at baseline (1Â day prior to surgery), at 6 and 12Â months after surgery. A total of 94 patients (67% females and 33% males) were included in the study. The excess BMI loss at 6 and 12Â months after surgery was 97.9â€‰Â±â€‰20.1% and 110.2â€‰Â±â€‰30.5% respectively. The FFM showed a reduction of 6.6â€‰Â±â€‰4.8Â kg (pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) 6Â months after surgery and of 7.9â€‰Â±â€‰4.9Â kg (pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) at 12Â months, meaning a decrease of 10.5â€‰Â±â€‰7.3% and a 12.9â€‰Â±â€‰6.6% respectively. The bone mass decrease was 10.1â€‰Â±â€‰6.9% (pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) and 12.9â€‰Â±â€‰6.5% (pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) at 12Â months after OAGB. OAGB obtains a relevant weight loss in patients with morbid obesity, mainly, due to fat mass reductions. However, this procedure also provokes FFM and bone mass decreases, especially in females, but not significantly greater than other restrictive or mixed procedures.",10.1007/s11695-020-04603-3,0,,0,1659
1092,Stapling Versus Hand Suture for Gastroenteric Anastomosis in Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: a Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Different anastomotic techniques have been evaluated during a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB); however, no techniques have proven to be better than any other regarding complications and the percentage of weight loss (excess weight loss (%EWL)), and there are few controlled prospective studies to compare them. A randomized, prospective study was conducted in 238 patients undergoing RYGB for morbid obesity between July 2008 and September 2012 to compare the early and late postoperative complications between the two surgical techniques: gastrojejunal hand-sutured anastomosis (HSA) and circular-stapled anastomosis (CSA). Minimum follow-up was 24 months. The two groups of patients were similar for demographic data and preoperative comorbidities. There were no significant differences between the surgical techniques regarding %EWL at 3, 12, and 24 months. The patients with CSA had a greater frequency of postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) (4.2 vs. 0%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.024) and surgical wound infection (11.1 vs. 3.4%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.025) than the patients with HSA, with no significant differences in the other early complications. There were no significant differences in either group for late complications (gastrojejunal anastomosis (GJA) stricture, marginal ulcer, GJA perforation, bowel obstruction, and eventration). No significant differences were observed in operative time, rate of reoperation and postoperative length of hospital stay. HSA and CSA were techniques with similar safety and effectiveness in our study. HSA had a lower rate of bleeding complications and surgical wound infection, although it does require greater experience in laparoscopic hand suturing.",10.1007/s11695-015-1638-2,0,,0,1660
769,Revisional Gastric Bypass Is Inferior to Primary Gastric Bypass in Terms of Short- and Long-term Outcomes-Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Although Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the main primary bariatric procedure, it has also been utilized as revisional bariatric surgery. Our aim is to compare revisionary gastric bypass with primary gastric bypass through systematic review with meta-analysis. Available literature was searched for eligible studies up to December 2017. Inclusion criteria were reports on morbidity, %EWL, or diabetes remission. Secondary outcomes involved mortality, anastomotic leakage, operative time, and length of hospital stay. Random effect meta-analyses were undertaken. Initial search yielded 1164 references. Final meta-analysis involved 21 studies and revealed significant differences in terms of morbidity (RR1.54, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and EWL (WMD-19.9, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). There were no differences in diabetes remission. Revisionary RYGB has worse weight loss effect with greater morbidity rate than primary RYGB.",10.1007/s11695-018-3300-2,0,,0,1661
1027,Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Versus Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy to Treat Morbid Obesity-Related Comorbidities: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Our aim was to compare laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) for treating morbid obesity and its related comorbidities. An electronic literature search was performed from inception to May 2015 and a total of 18,455 patients, enrolled in 62 recent studies, were included in this meta-analysis. Patients receiving LRYGB had a significantly higher percentage of excess weight loss and better resolution of hypertension, dyslipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and arthritis compared with those receiving LSG. LRYGB and LSG showed similar effects on type 2 diabetes mellitus and sleep apnea.",10.1007/s11695-015-1996-9,0,,0,1662
169,"One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB) with a 150-cm Biliopancreatic Limb (BPL) Versus a 200-cm BPL, a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.","This is a systematic review and meta-analysis that assessed the impact of performing OAGB with a 150-cm BPL versus a 200-cm BPL concerning weight loss, comorbidities remission, and adverse nutritional effects. The analysis included studies that compared patients who underwent OAGB with a 150-cm BPL and 200-cm BPL. Eight studies were eligible for this review after searching in the EMBASE, PubMed central database, and Google scholar. The pooled analysis revealed favoring the 200-cm BPL limb length for weight loss, with a highly significant difference in the TWL% (p=0.009). Both groups showed comparable comorbidities remission. Significantly higher ferritin and folate deficiency rates were found in the 200-cm BPL group. Considering a 200-cm BPL when performing OAGB delivers a better weight loss outcome than a 150-cm BPL, which is at the expense of a more severe nutritional deficiency. No significant differences were found regarding the comorbidities' remission.",10.1007/s11695-023-06556-9,0,,0,1663
